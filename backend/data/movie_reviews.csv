m/0814255, A fantasy adventure that fuses Greek mythology to contemporary American places and values. Anyone around 15 (give or take a couple of years) will thrill to the visual spectacle
m/0878835," Like Holofcener's previous pictures, Please Give derives its narrative energy less from a series of plotted incidents than from its keenly observed interplay of clashing personality tics and worldviews."
m/10," 10 (1979) is known for its numerical rating system for beautiful women. It described itself as ""a temptingly tasteful comedy for adults"
m/1000013-12_angry_men," Thoroughly engaging, there is nothing dated or corny in Reginald Rose's intensely knowing screenplay and Lumet's energetic direction."
m/1000079-20000_leagues_under_the_sea, [The] embodiment of Disney at his best -- family entertainment that superbly uses brand-new wonders of film technology.
m/10000_bc," The mammoths, the savage, beaked jungle beasts and the giant sabre tooth tiger all make splendid appearances. The spectacular landscapes of desert, mountain, river and jungle also deliver the images we are expecting. It's the humans who let us down."
m/1000121-39_steps," If you haven't seen it, do."
m/1000123-310_to_yuma, The enjoyment here that outweighs the film's derivativeness comes in the dialogue and relationship developed between outlaw and rancher.
m/10002008-charly," If religious films aren't your bailiwick, stay away. Otherwise, this could be a passable date film."
m/1000204-abraham_lincoln, It is quite a worthy pictorial offering with a genuinely fine and inspiring performance by Walter Huston in the role of the martyred President.
m/10002114-dark_water," A horror movie that sits there and drags and seems very full of itself, and is based on the premise that puddles are scary. They're not."
m/1000224-accused, Provides a searing account of a gang rape through the story of two women who speak out against this violent crime
m/10002516-lost_city," Staged with credibility and loads of Cubano flair, the film slows to a sludgy crawl, giving us lots of time to consider it as a pro-old-guard, anti- revolutionary elegy."
m/1000253-adams_rib," It lost some of its luster with time, but it's still amusing."
m/10002635-bridge_of_san_luis_rey," The stellar cast can do little to paper over the cracks in an awkward, unevenly-paced script that is composed of a series of sometimes-attractive scenes with little emotional undertow."
m/10002673-prowler," Losey's script is fine, but doesn't really draw the audience in, or inspire compassion for any of the characters."
m/10003276-criminal," The movie was made just four years ago by Argentinian director Fabian Bielinsky. It is called Nine Queens, and it is vastly superior to this blah U.S. remake from director Gregory Jacobs."
m/1000334-adventures_of_mark_twain, Such a wonderfully entertaining and rather charming film.
m/10003437-deep_blue," Practically every shot in Deep Blue offers some sort of remarkable, jaw-dropping sight."
m/1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood," A wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful, cartoonish figures."
m/10003876-man_hunt, a daring film that explicitly prefigures the surge of anti-Nazi cinema that was to come
m/10004050-bandwagon, A funny and rollickingly good movie about the challenges of keeping a band together on the road.
m/10004209-tristan_and_isolde," With a bizarre coiffure that makes him look like the lead singer of an '80s New Wave band, Franco flares his nostrils and pouts -- his performance riddled with so many Anakin-ims you'll think he's auditioning for The Hayden Christensen Story."
m/10004226-wild_side, A morbid and self-important homosexual Jules & Jim for the new millennium.
m/10004288-running_scared, Paul Walker is the principal actor. Need we say more?
m/10004352-going_the_distance," There are few genuine jokes here, just familiar comic happenings."
m/10004504-ultraviolet," Ultraviolet is nice to gaze at but otherwise simplistic, senseless, and eminently skippable."
m/10004635-home_of_the_brave," This doc recounting the tragic story of Viola Liuzzo, the only white woman killed during the civil rights struggle, doubles as a narrative of the nascent women's movement."
m/10004659-arthur, The bucolic wonder buried in Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles has been snuffed out by this alienating and dislikable animated film. As overproduced and acrid as The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc and The Fifth Element.
m/10004684-malevolence, Malevolence is the result of a film lover that spent their entire life striving to be the best they can.
m/10004697-eternal," Lush, lurid and completely besotted with itself, Eternal is one of those movies normally found slinking around the ether of late-night cable television."
m/10004890-narrow_margin," A hard-as-nails, noir-ish thriller from the often underrated Richard Fleischer."
m/10004925-matador," Brosnan and Kinnear deliver one of the most satisfying ""guy movie"" duos since De Niro and Grodin paired up for Midnight Run."
m/10005057-smile," Smile is like a dose of cod liver oil: It may be good for you, but it's no fun."
m/10005104-intruder, Seductive and emotionally charged but maddeningly elusive.
m/10005178-saint_ralph," Ralph Walker is no Max Fischer, and his monomania gets dull fast."
m/10005403-the_baxter, This romantic comedy about losers in love gave me some laughs but couldn't make me fall in love.
m/10005499-oliver_twist, The spark that an original point of view might bring to the oft-told tale is missing.
m/10005755-g, The decadent world of Hamptonite hip-hop moguls is a fitting backdrop for this somewhat faithful but not very graceful retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'Great Gatsby.'
m/1000580-alexander_the_great, The most notable battle on view in this picture isn't any of the skirmishes between Alexander's army and the opposing forces but the effort between Burton's blonde wig and March's shaggy beard to upstage each other in grievous grooming.
m/1000581-alfie," The question the film asks is, ""Why not?"" Surely life is to be enjoyed? The answer is grimmer than you expect."
m/10005819-10005819-neverwas," This is the kind of movie where a madwoman's outburst leads her to throw a mug that just happens to be filled with gold sparkles -- which can then be photographed cascading down on all the adorable loonies, in slow-motion."
m/10006007-the_second_chance," [The film is] sabotaged by hackneyed dialogue, sluggish pacing and a listless performance by Smith, who only springs to life when he's singing."
m/10006057-moonlight," The situation compels you to keep watching, only to be disappointed when you realize the story's not going anywhere."
m/1000617-aliens," The ads for Aliens claim that this movie will frighten you as few movies have, and, for once, the ads don't lie."
m/1000626-all_about_eve," All About Eve (1950), is a realistic, dramatic depiction of show business and backstage life of Broadway and the New York theater. The devastating debunking of stage and theatrical characters was..."
m/10006270," Eat soaks up the passions, disagreements, and love the Seder inspires, with the writers capturing the utter chaos of a full dinner table."
m/10006324," [A] most unfabulous, unfunny, and unwatchable embarrassment."
m/10006343-dirty," At the end of the antiheroes' ropes, at the end of writer-director Chris Fisher's genre exercise, guns have been drawn, blood has been spilled, cops have been thwarted from going straight, and nothing has changed."
m/10006370-stay_alive," Debuting director William Brent Bell, who wrote the script with producer Matthew Peterman, keeps the pace brisk and the pot bubbling."
m/1000640-all_of_me, Carl Reiner's likeable and funny comedy about mind and body switching features a great performance from Steve Martin in one of his best roles.
m/10006434-dreamland," Despite some sketchy story elements, much of it is pretty intoxicating -- that is, until the unambiguous life lessons bring pic down to earth with an earnest splat."
m/10006485-black_gold, A film to think about every time you order a Triple Grande Soy Latte.
m/1000654-all_the_kings_men," All the King's Men (1949) is the fictionalized account of the rise and fall of a backwoods rebel - a story inspired by the rule (and abuse of power) of Louisiana's colorful state governor and Democratic U.S. Senator, the notorious Huey Pierce Long..."
m/10006588-street_fight," It's a hard, fast film that needs airing now, or at least before the Newark elections of 2006."
m/10006780-lost_horizon," The material is so slight it can hardly bear the weight of music, and it sinks altogether during a series of the most incompetent and clumsy dance numbers I've ever seen."
m/10006848-the_motel, Indie coming-of-age dramedy about a precocious Chinese-American youth whose family operates a sleazy roadside motel signals arrival of a singularly promising filmmaker.
m/10006849-once_in_a_lifetime," ...a stylish scramble of evocative footage, groovy music, and crazy-candid reminiscences from key players still proud to score."
m/10006856-requiem," Requiem isn't a horror movie so much as a thwarted coming-of-age story, like Carrie without the bloody reckoning."
m/10007139-park," It's a hilarious, crowd-pleasing film about everything from honesty to sex to freedom that's definitely smart without being too overbearing."
m/10007333-bon_cop_bad_cop," Accessible and entertaining, with enough local flavor to seem exotic to English viewers. Not only that, but it's FUN."
m/10007415-amazing_grace," This compelling bio-pic is an overdue tribute to William Wilberforce (1759-1833), the British abolitionist who, for 20 years, tirelessly lobbied Parliament to end England's participation in the slave trade."
m/10007598-cocaine_cowboys, Informative documentary filmmaking that belongs as much on library shelves and agency case files as in your local theatre.
m/10007614-gone, First-time director Ringan Ledwidge conjures up an effectively creepy mood to accompany three young backpackers on an ill-fated road trip across the Aussie desert.
m/10007714-situation," The situation in The Situation is grimly photogenic, yet persistently opaque."
m/10007821-snow_blind," It's understandable that Scott wants to highlight snowboarding's diversity, but perhaps a winter-sports documentary shouldn't try to cover the waterfront."
m/10007856-four_sheets_to_the_wind," Harjo's likable Native American fable is very much in the tradition of Smoke Signals, except that the equally sentimental narrative centers on a siblings relationsip rather than father-son medlodrama."
m/10007886-the_tigers_tail," An almost madcap comic pace battles with thundercloud-building drama . . . The social commentary can be earnest and bald, with the mythic overtones seemingly contrived to tumble O'Leary into the class gap on his arse."
m/10007893-its_a_boy_girl_thing, There's little doubt that Boy Girl Thing was assembled by someone who was obviously blindfolded and possibly drugged.
m/10007898-slipstream, A visual masterpiece and an amazing achievement in cinematography and editing.
m/10007902-delirious," A joyously raucous, sexy, deliciously biting fable...Delirious is superbly entertaining and completely satisfying"
m/10007916_interview, Steve Buscemi's adaptation preserves the original's biting basic scenario while adding a few Americanizing tweaks to this tale.
m/1000792-american_anthem, It's another example of how our most popular art form has been taken possession by what appear to be extraterrestrial moviemakers from the planet Stallone.
m/10007947-ten," Hilarious stuff, though many of the segments go on too long, so that the gags tend to wear out their welcome."
m/10007985-happening," For all his complaints recently about being misunderstood, it seems it's Shyamalan who simply doesn't get us."
m/10008005-moliere, Two scripters let their imaginations soar to show us how Moliere would act if he became a character of one of his plays and met people from his other productions--and it works!
m/10008126-straightheads," The film is a shallow study of the ~intoxicating allure of violence', with a few gratuitous tit shots thrown in for good measure."
m/10008140-borderland," An unnerving, ruthless, borderline-mesmerizing thriller."
m/10008200-spiral," Spiral is an interesting experiment in the evocation of things that do not actually exist, and it succeeds with sizzle."
m/10008234-alexandra," An arty, cerebral film, Alexandra nevertheless speaks to the heart like a symphony."
m/10008390_blood_and_tears," 'A small house can accommodate hundreds of friends, but can't accommodate two enemies,' the doctor says ruefully, quoting an Arab proverb. Sadly, Blood and Tears is the proof."
m/10008423-cool_school," Largely avoids sharply delineated portraits, with its focus on the scene at the expense of individuals, ultimately resulting in a documentary that doesn't rise above the functional."
m/10008496-pathology," Not exactly a great movie, but it's sick, slick, and strange enough to warrant a 90-minute look."
m/10008502-christmas_carol," Shortchanging traditional animation by literalizing it while robbing actors of their full range of facial expressiveness, the performance-capture technique favored by director Robert Zemeckis looks more than ever like the emperor's new clothes."
m/10008507-deep_water," Stories celebrating heroic journeys are commonplace, but this is a sobering, anti-heroic tale of an ordinary man who set out to attempt the extraordinary... and failed through a cruel combination of bad luck and bad judgement."
m/10008587-beverly_hills_chihuahua," While it doesn't work particularly well on any of those levels, it is a colourful addition to the always popular talking dog genre."
m/10008601-fireflies_in_the_garden," The cast are uniformly good; it's all competent, but its somehow not completely satisfactory."
m/10008606-eye," Quite faithful until the dumbed-down Americanized ending, yet time and again the treatment is inferior."
m/10008607-day_of_the_dead," Nowhere near the worst zombie movie I've ever seen, but it will follow in the slew of truly atrocious remakes undeserving of their titles..."
m/10008611-my_best_friends_girl," It's disturbing to think of the millions of teenage boys who will laugh when he insults a girl to get her in bed, or pees in a cactus plant at a restaurant."
m/10008613-burrowers," Beautifully shot and tightly scripted, it's the rare Hollywood genre film that's more concerned with human relationships and behavior than the mysterious supernatural forces that sets the action in motion."
m/10008617-midnight_meat_train," MEAT TRAIN is the first BOOK OF BLOOD to depart from the station in a long time and it's refreshing to see that the film carries that bleak, yet romantic touch of Clive Barker all over it... it's guaranteed to make you squirm, scream and beg for more!"
m/10008618-return," It's hard to find the genuine heartfelt moments in The Lucky Ones, a story about three Iraq War soldiers on a brief road trip back in the U.S., under the clutter of narrative contrivances and coincidences."
m/10008621-run_fat_boy_run," Enjoyable, sharply written and frequently hilarious comedy with strong comic performances from its cast. This should strike a chord with slightly overweight men everywhere."
m/10008652-closing_escrow," While far from the cream of the mockumentary crop, it's still a pleasant diversion."
m/10008655-whiteout," It's a wonder Whiteout isn't in 3D, what with its initial onslaught of in-your-face flying propellers, crashing planes, and a lingering close-up of Kate Beckinsale stripping to her skivvies."
m/10008661-randy_and_the_mob," It's just that the comedy and the drama never quite crystalize into anything remotely affecting, with the end result feeling more like some extended Southern in-joke than an honest movie."
m/10008667-black_irish, It'll be worth watching to see if [director Brad Gann] plays to his strengths on future projects.
m/10008678-wild_child," Despite a shaky start, Wild Child is actually a surprisingly entertaining teen flick, thanks to likeable performances and a script that highlights the importance of friendship. Worth seeing."
m/10008687-powder_blue, A movie full of egregiously overdramatic stupidities.
m/10008698-king_corn," Sometimes obvious, but at other times quite startling."
m/10008699-terrors_advocate," About halfway through ... the movie's two-hour-+ running time begins to drag, as Shroeder's narrative seems more and more a catalog of events."
m/10008700-darfur_now," Despite honorable intent, docu is too ambitious for its own good, too burdened with celebs, and not insightful enough about its signficant issues."
m/10008703-rails_and_ties," The opening act is strong, but the story's trajectory is so obvious this often seems to be traveling along tracks as well -- into a valley of soap suds."
m/10008705-mr_untouchable, It gives the self-aggrandizing Barnes just enough celluloid to hang himself.
m/10008706-house, The film doesn't achieve the horror or creep factor it could have%u2014or that the trailer seems to promise%u2014mainly because of strange stylistic choices.
m/10008744-canvas," Canvas is a movie that rings emotionally true, despite structural contrivances and dim, washed-out color."
m/10008747-skid_row," ...Skid Row too often comes to feel like a vanity project, with the focus of the film frequently shifting away from Skid Row's history and people to Pras's sketchy immersion in homelessness..."
m/10008748-saawariya," Ranbir Raj is a charming presence with moves that suggest a cross between Justin Timberlake and Gene Kelly, but the screen really comes to life when it's full of dancers."
m/10008754-flawless," As far as what the filmmakers constructed, the spirit of the title term is close enough to forgive blemishes that don't really spoil the fun."
m/10008760-what_happens_in_vegas," The film delivers what it promises as a freewheeling, bitchy-mouthed romantic comedy, so it's a good date movie. Perhaps newlyweds, too"
m/10008785-appaloosa, Bring back Hopalong Cassidy and Randolph Scott and you've got the making of a respectable horse opera.
m/10008786-good," Despite Mortensen's heroic effort, Good is simply not good, a failed version of a stylized, powerful play of ideas about the devastating price of conformity."
m/10008820-visitor, Much more interested in its interpersonal relationships than it is in climbing a soapbox and preaching to the choir.
m/10008830-bill, ...basically entertaining yet entirely forgettable.
m/10008849-married_life, You know you're in trouble if the wallpaper is more exciting than anything that happens in front of it.
m/10008856-badland, Badland takes a step in the right direction by attempting to understand the aftermath of war.
m/10008924-oxford_murders," Not so terrible that you can understand why it's been practically buried by its distributors, but you can get better ridiculous whodunits on TV."
m/10008954-untraceable, Untraceable is a satisfying slice of solidly crafted meat-and-potatoes filmmaking.
m/10008991-informers," The Informers is the kind of movie that, upon leaving the theater, provokes the urge to take a shower."
m/10008992-meeting_resistance," Of all the Iraq documentaries that have been released since the war began five years ago, this is the one that most seriously addresses the nature of the insurgency."
m/10009001-the_freshman," With Brando around, The Freshman has a snappy madness that's hard to resist."
m/10009005-a_bloody_aria," It would have been fine but the acting is pretty over the top, making scenes almost laughable."
m/10009029-kenny," The result is a minor masterpiece of tone in Kenny's portrayal of a character that is absurd, guileless and shrewd at the same time."
m/10009055-rocker," It's modestly entertaining, occasionally funny, and generally agreeable. I just don't think Wilson should quit his day job yet."
m/10009063-perfect_holiday," Spicing up Christmas with some savvy soul, are tough love story tour guide Queen Latifah, Terrence Howard as her sidekick mute meanie, and devilish duo Katt Williams and Charlie Murphy's J-Jizzy, doing musical bad boys with deliciously nasty glee."
m/10009066-la_graine_et_le_mulet," Thriambos toy sfihtoy senarioy me stoho kai apopsi kai tis aplis kinimatografisis me emfasi stin oysia tis, to La Graine et le Mulet einai eykola ap' tis kalyteres tainies tis hronias. To mono hreiazetai, einai to tharros na mpeis stin aithoysa, ki as' to"
m/10009083-land_of_the_lost," The movie's abbreviated title is LOL, which is ironic since Ferrell offers hardly a smile, much less laughter out loud."
m/10009132-rec, ...this experience feels like being trapped in a haunted maze and there are images here that are the stuff of nightmares.
m/10009138-look," The thread binding these unrelated folks is a common disconnect between public facades and private conduct, though the notion that people aren't always who they appear to be is hardly some sort of revelation about society or human behavior."
m/10009151-box," A logically impaired, hyperbolic mess that darts from one high-concept idea to another as flowingly, and painfully, as someone with a bladder infection."
m/10009169-man_in_the_chair, A neorealist drama passed through a J-Horror filter.
m/10009172-undoing," A smidgen of originality lies in its being a noir film with Korean characters: others nothing new, but still a watchable gangster pic."
m/10009176-black_water," Black Water may be derivative, but it ain't no crock"
m/10009192-21, Manages to make the act of counting cards seem as exciting as this past winter's Super Bowl -- and as perilous as climbing Mount Everest with both eyes closed.
m/10009210-duchess_of_langeais," Patience, waiting, frustration, bad timing, lost opportunities - it takes a certain directorial boldness to highlight these as the principal themes of what is essentially a claustrophobic two-hander whose duration extends to nearly two and a half hours."
m/10009212-ben_x, [Director Nic] Balthazar's determination to draw a positive message from a negative situation doesn't quite fit.
m/10009225-body_of_lies, DiCaprio works hard while Crowe does chores at home and eats.
m/10009239-passengers," With a storytelling sensibility more common in foreign films than mainstream ones, Passengers is a compact, thought-provoking tale that challenges the viewer while shedding light on one's own life, and how he or she has chosen to lead it."
m/10009244-the_grand," Put Herzog at the same table as Hines, Harrelson, Parnell, Cross, and Farina, and poker on film starts to look a lot less dull. Imagine what they could do with Monopoly."
m/10009253-the_hammer," A nearly comatose comedy that spends its time just bum-stumbling along, never putting in the work necessary to land a solid joke or develop a winning character."
m/10009254-shutter," 'Shutter' is a movie that's a few years behind its time, maybe even a few decades."
m/10009274-priest," Paul Bettany in a cassock with a cross biroed on to his forehead, potholing with vampires. In 3D."
m/10009323-broken," Fleeting pleasures are undermined by an inane, directionless narrative, barely-even-one-dimensional characters and an overall sense of superficiality."
m/10009334-the_escapist, Those looking for an innovative new take on the prison genre should be pleased with the latest from this talented filmmaker.
m/10009355-sugar," Sympathetic, genial and exceedingly wholesome, it's a film that, once seen, will permanently and favorably influence the way viewers regard the characters' real-life counterparts."
m/10009420-quid_pro_quo," An exceedingly odd meeting of the minds (and bodies) occurs in Quid Pro Quo, a strikingly original and provocative first feature from scribe-helmer Carlos Brooks."
m/10009421-red, The idea that a man would go so far over the death of a dog is a little hard to buy into.
m/10009426-guitar," Without its weirdo visual flourishes, The Guitar would be completely reprehensible."
m/10009460-the_road," The two principals are superb, and the direction is resonant in its very restraint."
m/10009462-g_force," Galifianakis's comedy thrives on risk. In G-Force, he does the most subversive thing possible in a big budget PG picture: he plays it straight."
m/10009469-the_other_man, Seldom has such great star power been marshaled in the service of a sillier movie than The Other Man.
m/10009493-duchess," For all its luscious period trappings and Keira Knightley's spirited take on the title role, Saul Dibb's handsome biopic reveals little about how Georgiana Spencer Cavendish became one of 18th-century London's most celebrated and influential aristocrats."
m/10009516-women," The original version of The Women, shrill and campy as it can be, is miles ahead of this remake when it comes to issues of class and social maneuvering."
m/10009526-public_enemies," ... a solid, smart adult entry into the summer sweepstakes this year, and a nice moment for Mann, even if it doesn't particularly break new ground."
m/10009552-julia," Tilda Swinton gives a committed and courageously unsympathetic performance as the self-serving Julia, but this is a character with whom you would rather spend as little time as possible - and certainly not the endurance-testing running time."
m/1000957-angel_and_the_badman, One of Wayne's top B efforts; an offbeat love story that works as a romance as well as a Western. Russell is luminous.
m/10009583-fade_to_black," A retro pastiche that, like The Good German before it, will be of limited interest to all but the most ardent film buff."
m/1000959-angel_heart, Seriously creepy bayou noir with more twists than you can shake a chicken bone at.
m/10009596-old_dogs, So wretched that it should be unceremoniously put down.
m/10009598-surrogates," High concept and high budget, Surrogates adds astounding techno magic to ideas mooted in films like Multiplicity, Total Recall and I Robot, but fails to achieve the humanity the film champions"
m/10009624-promotion," I predict that when this film is released, lots of critics who miss the point will complain about its muted tone. Scott and Reilly actually underplay the comedy to great effect."
m/10009632-notorious, A sanitized treatment that embraces every cliche of musical biography without shedding much real light on its subject.
m/10009635-soul_men, Bernie Mac's last film before his untimely death is a let-it-rip irreverent comedy invested with Bernie's trademark brand of earthy humor.
m/10009636-igor, There's enough good stuff here that a better 'toon could have been stitched together from the many promising funny parts.
m/10009680-matador," . For all of its inherent gore and breathtaking surprises, ""The Matador"" is an essential window on the personality of an athlete working in an incredibly dangerous sport."
m/10009791-auteur," There's no Hitchcock in The Auteur, which is surprising considering the second syllable of the Master of Suspense's surname."
m/10009799-caller, Close but no cigar as a great international corporate mystery thriller slows to a crawl in a drawn out study of death. Frank Langella and Elliott Gould should have been used better.
m/10009823-sin_nombre," ""Sin Nombre"" is a convincing verite-styled drama that pulls you into its dangerous universe of desperation and immediacy."
m/10009828-house_of_sleeping_beauties," Sure, there's copious full-frontal female nudity and an aroused male body part, but such scenes are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. There's a subtle difference, but still a difference."
m/10009926-alvin_and_the_chipmunks_2," The world's most irritatingly high-pitched rodents are back and noisier than ever, in this lobotomised rip-off of the High School Musical franchise."
m/10009929-a_christmas_tale," A marvelously rich visual, intellectual and emotional experience, one that I expect will grow deeper with repeat viewings."
m/10009980-rebound," It's laboured and clunky, or crude and vulgar, when it should be funny and zippy"
m/10009992-ripple_effect," Nothing more than an elongated soap opera, sans the self-awareness."
m/1000_times_good_night," The film survives mostly off the wonderful, absorbing leading performance by Binoche, in what a truly layered character to get your head around."
m/10010011-harold, The presence of Cuba Gooding Jr. in this odd little indie comedy should set off early alarm bells.
m/10010066-push, One of the better recent attempts at cashing in on the superhero film craze without having an actual comic book to adapt.
m/10010077-felon," Kilmer and Dorff, who was also an executive producer, immerse themselves in difficult roles and the film's overall air of social commitment will surprise viewers drawn in by its exploitation-movie promotion."
m/10010131-scar," Run of the mill, largely predictable slasher movie that unfortunately squanders the 3D gimmick that could have made it interesting."
m/10010150-unborn," Exactly what you'd expect from the combination of its release date, genre, and MPAA rating"
m/10010153-bitch_slap," In any other world, this would be getting a DVD or Syfy-only release, and Jacobson's talents would be better utilized directing Playboy Channel interstitials."
m/10010155-forever_strong," Adhering to the belief that action scenes are more thrilling when you can't tell what the hell is going on, the director gives us just the ""highlights."""
m/10010208-chocolate, JeeJa Yanin is a sensational discovery but this mixed assortment of high kicks and even higher melodrama may be an imperfect vehicle for her.
m/10010214-fireproof," After a shaky start and a steady middle, the film ends on a genuinely moving note; the folks at Sherwood Baptist Church have made their most impressive movie yet."
m/10010229-dostana," This is a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music."
m/10010249-the_garden," A beautiful portrait of a unique downtown LA community of poor Mexican-Americans who've turned urban blight into a marvelous garden and fight a developer determined to shut them down. A moving, inspiring documentary."
m/10010329-splinter," The creature feature is loaded with blood, guts, gore, the perfect anti-hero and a hilariously fun plot, which is played straight until the very end...Wilkins delivers a simple, yet effective '80s creature feature that's not only scary, but also a great t"
m/10010334-leaves_of_grass," Playing identical twin brothers who have landed on very different ends of the personality spectrum, Norton gives two bravura comic performances, shoulder-to-shoulder..."
m/10010335-rab_ne_bana_di_jodi," Smart, colorful and well-acted Bollywood romantic comedy succumbs to sentimental wish-fulfillment toward the end, but could still teach Hollywood rom-coms a thing or two."
m/10010458-proposal, Diverting romantic antic about a sham engagement is sparked by the bright chemistry and comic timing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.
m/10010552-gigantic," The various twilight performances of the veteran players deserve a look, as do the always interesting appearances of Mr. Dano and Ms. Deschanel. Only the sparks are missing this time."
m/10010568-fuel," While Fuel takes persuasive swipes at the influence of oil-based energy companies over domestic and foreign policy, the film is more dazzling as an introduction to all kinds of clean energy alternatives many of us have never heard of."
m/10010571-hush," Hush proves you don't need a Jason, Freddy or Michael to create a nasty little horror showcase."
m/1001063-anna_karenina," If you still doubt either Hollywood's ability to deal with a masterpiece or Greta Garbo's greatness as an artist, this is the picture to see."
m/10010658-orphan," Teasingly enjoyable rubbish through the first hour, Orphan becomes genuine trash during its protracted second half."
m/10010662-my_sisters_keeper," My Sister's Keeper is a shameless weepy, one of the most manipulative and fundamental of genres, but it also raises some surprisingly difficult and thought-provoking ethical questions."
m/10010667-hangover, I loved Fat Jesus. A comedy that's funny and naughty. This is a franchise. Mike Tyson has a career in movies!
m/10010668-stepfather, [Nelson] McCormick has crafted a horror remake so undistinguished it makes Prom Night look like a masterpiece of transgressive filmmaking.
m/10010675-departures, A fine film that's gently funny and moving and not the least bit challenging or controversial.
m/10010680-boogie," Naturalistic performances, long takes, unfussy edits and a story that unfolds over a few hours are all present and correct."
m/10010692-ballerina, Ballet lovers will enjoy the footage of the young ballerinas taking command of their respective performances.
m/10010694-season_of_the_witch, It's not quite nutty enough to be a guilty pleasure.
m/10010703-shuttle, A decently twisty indie thriller about hostages lured aboard an airport minivan whose destination is nowhere pleasant.
m/10010760-miss_march," The best mainstream comedy so far this year. Every time you start thinking how you've seen it all before, you find yourself laughing too hard to care."
m/10010782-american_affair," A dash of Ingmar Bergman and Oliver Stone in this Capitol Hill noir, as kinky DC sexual politics collide with flaky JFK conspiracy theories, and Bay of Pigs CIA boozer masterminds wonder if communists are having more fun."
m/10010785-grace," Deeply unsettling stuff ... [but] sharp, witty and ambitiously artful too, like some lost gem from the highbrow spectrum of '70s exploitation cinema"
m/10010787-endgame, There's nothing in Endgame that's less than proficient.
m/10010789-red_baron," A very low-flying, sentimentalised account of the life of legendary first world war German air ace, Manfred Von Richthofen."
m/10010919-objective," Although the film has an undeniably strong, suspenseful tone -- not to mention symbolic resonance -- it doesn't rise above its overly familiar setup."
m/10010940-happy_tears," In this year's crop of Oscar-nominated shorts, the animated category beats the live-action offerings."
m/10010944-missing_person," Not the most riveting of noir dramas, this film exists mainly to project the talents of Michael Shannon in the role of a drunk private eye."
m/10010957-polanski_unauthorized," To describe the film as this generation's ""Wired"" hardly begins to scratch the surface. This is a movie so bad that the people who actually made ""Wired"" can actually look down upon it without coming across as hypocritical."
m/10010972-mammoth, Comes with too much repetitive exposition and lacks an emotional payoff.
m/10011003-crude, It's impossible to watch this film and not come away with a personal vow never to patronize the Chevron corporation again.
m/10011016-messenger," Although Hollywood has dealt with the war from various perspectives, Moverman's film offers a new angle that brings the horrors home about the decision to go to war."
m/10011050-lake_mungo," Genuinely compelling, this mock documentary from first time feature director Joel Anderson builds on its wonderfully eerie mood to deliver an enigmatic ghost story, family drama and story about a teenage girl with secrets."
m/10011079-country_teacher," This sweetly ingenuous film, written and directed by Bohdan Slma, is a lot less sentimental about cows and flowers than it is about its human protagonists, who fall domino-like in love with churls who won't love them back."
m/1001115-apartment, The Apartment is the kind of unsuccessful picture that nevertheless demonstrates that everyone involved is capable of better work.
m/10011154-golden_boys, This musty yarn would have worked better as a 1940s MGM programmer.
m/10011235-fame," ""Fame"" is content to simply repeat the key moments from the first film without any of the grit or energy that was on display the first time around."
m/10011262-outrage, One can at least partly embrace the concept that outing pols who torpedo gay rights is defensible and still find Dick's film too frequently a would-be sensationalistic bit of tut-tutting for queer Dems and their politically-connected friends.
m/10011284-skin," Laing's troubled history is full of heart-wrenching tragedy and, for most of its running time, Skin is very effective. The trouble is, it feels quite small, more like a Movie of the Week than a fully fledged feature."
m/10011303-helen," You couldn't call this audacious British debut a success; it's too arch, awkward and over-extended for that. But, oddly, it's those very same qualities which make it arresting to watch and which mark out its two directors as talents to keep an eye on."
m/10011304-thirst," Although the focus of its narrative movement is not always clear, in its best moments, Thirst offers something of the poetic force of cinema's timeless masterpieces."
m/10011335-vengeance," If indeed there is anything surprising about this clich-packed genre fare, it's the degree to which To and his screenwriter Wai Ka-Fai are prepared to indulge their flair for the ludicrous."
m/10011379-new_world_order," New World Order essentially offers nothing 'new' on the topic, nor displays any concrete 'order' in structuring its haphazard collage of hit and run gotcha moments."
m/1001138-april_fools_day," There are much better 80's horror flicks to spend your money on, but April Fool's Day has enough jolts and twists to warrant a look."
m/10011388-blood_the_last_vampire," If you go in expecting an amusing stinker, you may enjoy it."
m/10011435-shrink, Hollywood movies don't get much more self-regarding than this.
m/10011457-ong_bak_2_2009, ...a self-aggrandizing historical epic that somehow proves that you can actually make a movie without a plot.
m/10011489-bananas, Fredrik Gertien's documentary about the alleged perils of being a Nicaraguan banana worker has landed the director in serious trouble with the Dole Food Company.
m/10011494-last_ride," Though the script doesn't always reach its potential, visually this is a stunning film that challenges its audience."
m/10011582-TRON_legacy," Whereas 3D has quickly become a dirty, corporate word, Tron: Legacy's use of the new technology to bring the audience directly into this very specific and unique world makes this movie a completely immersive experience."
m/10011647-canyon, Competent execution and respectable performances still can't save this threadbare attempt at a minimalistic Deliverance.
m/10011699-leslie_my_name_is_evil," Harkema's real problem is that he doesn't know which story he wants to tell, apart from taking potshots at governments, religions and ideologies he opposes."
m/10011721-broken_hill," Broken Hill, with its picture-postcard shots of the vast Outback, looks good and fills a niche for families."
m/10011735-beautiful_life, This intertwined tale of people struggling on society's fringe plays like bad community theater.
m/10011736-suck," Juggling conventions, skewering clichs and referencing genre cues, Stefaniuk packs the film with so many insider jokes that what could have been a wild ride simply isn't."
m/10011774-chloe, All three central performances are among what is right with Chloe. It is just too bad they are not supported by a better script.
m/1001180-armed_and_dangerous," How could two amazingly FUNNY guys spend so much effort on a movie so bereft of laughs? Candy and Levy deserve much better, and they moved on to it after this junkpile."
m/10011815-hole," Hits all the right notes for its target demographic, and Dante still has the chops to make it visually compelling for the rest."
m/10011846-nobodys_perfect, An extraordinary German documentary about 12 adults with disabilities created by the toxic drug Thalidomide and how a special project lifts their spirits and gives them a fresh sense of community.
m/10011854-good_soldier, A well-intentioned but uninvolving anti-war documentary.
m/10011857-high_life," High Life is filled with surprising, artful flourishes."
m/1001193-around_the_world_in_80_days," The movie has not aged well. Many of the performances are arch, playing the comedy broadly, which is blandly predictable as the film grinds on and on."
m/10011943-fall," The Fall is really just a dull, poorly acted courtroom drama with glossy, autumnal cinematography and an implausible twist."
m/10011944-good_heart, Kári's smug little arthouse offering ends up covered in Nicholas Sparks goo.
m/10011946-wonderful_world, An enjoyable look into one man's emotional journey even if it doesn't offer anything that new or indispensable in the grand scheme of things.
m/10011949-collapse, Smith's subject Michael Ruppert never registers as much more than an eloquent but largely untrustworthy quack.
m/10011984-last_song, Kinnear lends the movie a dignity it doesn't deserve and stands as the only cast member whose dramatic moments aren't propped up by soaring musical cues.
m/10012014-babies," An aesthetic exercise that gets at no deeper truth than ""babies are basically alike no matter the culture."""
m/10012039-lottery_ticket," It's comforting, really, to see the movie's soft-pedaling of actual ghetto problems; realism isn't Lottery Ticket's game."
m/10012042-going_the_distance, A bicoastal comedy with a bit of a bipolar disorder.
m/10012044-life_as_we_know_it, The feminine fantasies Berlanti seemingly seeks to stoke are undercut by a vibe thats weirdly misogynistic.
m/10012051-frozen," Frozen delivers enough thrills and gory chills to satisfy the horror film crowd, but is not written, directed or acted well enough to be a first-rate thriller."
m/10012058-prodigal_sons," Despite a fascinating midpoint revelation, Reed spends too much time capturing her sibling's terrifying outbursts, devoting the film's final act almost exclusively to his increasingly abject circumstances."
m/10012063-ghost_writer, McGregor hits all the right notes as a man with a conscience and sense of professional pride who is in way over his head.
m/10012068-repo_men," If you aren't too repulsed by the general ultra-violence and horror aspects, you're in for some treats of the gross out variety that could send you reeling to the lobby."
m/10012104-7_days, Grou's thriller tells a deeply immersive story that at no point strays from its intended path & delivers with such a punch that you'll be talking about it for 7 days after.
m/10012114-daddy_longlegs," A funny, fantastic, genuinely alarming quasi-autobiographical cheapster by twentysomething New York brothers Josh and Benny Safdie."
m/10012133-veer," Bollywood superstar Salman Khan's dream project, this highly fictionalized account of the Pindari war against the British is bad history but pretty good entertainment."
m/10012136-winters_bone," A character study, not only of Ree, but of a place and way of life, which shows that there is a lot more to what most people think of as 'hillbilly culture' than the stereotype."
m/10012141-kids_are_all_right, There's considerable originality in a story centering on a sperm donor whose identity and visits upend a household.
m/10012147-lucky, Blitz's fundamental embrace of human eccentricity shines through in a film that glows with optimism even as it reveals the dark side of a miracle.
m/10012150-high_school," Coasts over its missteps and succeeds on equal parts quick humor, likable characters, and pure energy. Oh, and weed."
m/10012207-stolen, Two missing children stories are combined to less than compelling effect in this sluggish thriller.
m/10012232-killing_jar, Thrillers that rely on tension-building within a small group of characters are harder to pull off than aspiring filmmakers may have been led to believe. Look no further than The Killing Jar for proof.
m/10012254-la_mission," Benjamin Bratt brings his A-game to a difficult, potentially clichd role."
m/10012256-predators," Full of surprises and twists, the action and the relationships between the contrasting characters keeps us glued"
m/10012264-stonewall," The story of how, in 1969, gays and lesbians fought the cops at Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn ... is told thoroughly but without much passion, humor, rowdiness, or smut."
m/10012282-oath," What emerges is an illuminating, though terribly dismaying, portrait of the War on Terror's lasting effects."
m/10012288-wild_hunt," A psychological thriller highlighting how hell hath no fury like a frustrated knight in shining armor, even if he only has a plastic sword at his disposal!"
m/1001240-arthur," That song will be stuck in your head for days, but ""Arthur"" is worth the torture."
m/10012426-lottery," Director Madeleine Sackler favors an agenda of advocacy over complexity, making The Lottery an effective, if unapologetically one-sided, piece of agitprop."
m/1001280-assault_on_precinct_13," John Carpenter's third movie (two years before Halloween), and one of his best."
m/1001294-asylum," If nothing else, a horror movie about cabbages could help Rosenberg work through his obsession and save a lot of analyst's fees."
m/1001323-attack_of_the_50_foot_woman, Old-school camp craziness of the tallest and most feminine variety.
m/1001406-avenging_angel," Was Donna Wilkes not available? Where have you gone, Betsy Russell?"
m/1001488-babes_in_toyland, A disgrace to the memory of Laurel and Hardy and the Hal Roach original.
m/1001553-bad_company," The movie is built as a series of more-or-less self-contained episodes, and the episodes that work are worth the effort."
m/1001567-bad_news_bears," This charming, funny film takes a gentle poke at Little League baseball and the American obsession with winning."
m/1001572-bad_seed, Wrung to the point of unwatchable by meandering monologues and slow reveals.
m/1001634-bang_the_drum_slowly," You don't have to understand baseball to appreciate this one, which is probably just as well."
m/1001816-battleground, It depicts a handful of men in the Battle of the Bulge with as much realism as Hollywood can muster.
m/1001902-beauty_and_the_beast," There are deep undercurrents to the film, suggesting a dark, horrible and wonderful secret that might be glimpsed if only the viewer stares hard enough."
m/1001994-belles_of_st_trinians, This transportation of Ronald Searle's awful school has been effected with the greatest possible success.
m/1001_grams," Lacking the looseness and easy charm of previous efforts, Hamer's ""1001 Grams"" is a forgettable disappointment."
m/1002178-best_of_times," Forgotten by most yet seemingly adored by those who choose to remember it, The Best of Times stands in my book as one of the truly great sports comedies."
m/1002205-betrayed," Betrayed is a film that left me in turmoil, torn between the strong sympathies I felt for the characters and the fundamental doubts I had about the plot."
m/1002310-big_business, Filmmaker Abrahams delivers a fairly forgettable comedy that boasts little in the way of memorable sequences or even overt laughs...
m/1002332-big_heat," Perfectly suited to film noir fans who like their stories dark, their characters dark, and their heroes decent but morally tested."
m/1002352-big_sleep, One of the greatest detective films to come out of Hollywood.
m/1002407-billy_budd, The problem with well-worn historical themes like the eighteenth-century British navy is how to clean the past of the clichés that now barnacle it... Here we have just the usual costume stuff.
m/1002448-birds," The Birds is an effective horror movie, although in typical Hitchcock style, there is far more scary anticipation than actual gore."
m/1002484-black_christmas, A whodunit that begs the question of why it was made.
m/1002497-black_hole," ...with so many great fantasy and sci-fi films appearing in the intervening years, I doubt that too many adults are going to find the Disney flick of much interest. I didn't."
m/1002511-black_pirate, Silent Fairbanks has acrobatic Doug and great effects.
m/1002526-black_sunday," At boasts set pieces, a variety of location, a competent cast and a surprising lack of conviction."
m/1002540-blackmail, Horrific and dated....worth seeing from a strictly historical standpoint.
m/1002571-blind_date," This is something special, even among its ilk. Frighteningly bad."
m/1002681-blue_angel, You can't hear 'Falling In Love Again' too many times.
m/1002930-born_yesterday, The highlight of this lively Garson Kanin Broadway comedy is the most delightful 'dumb blonde' to ever grace the screen...
m/1002939-boston_strangler, To be avoided as surely as a stranger who appears at your door and identifies himself as a plumber whom you have not called.
m/1002947-bounty," Hopkins brilliant perfomance adds complexity to Captain Bligh, and this intense and intelligent historical adventure is the third and best film version of the famous mutiny."
m/1002993-boys_from_brazil," Now, if only Uta Hagen and Rosemary Harris were rolling on the floor next to them, Boys From Brazil would have been an bigger scream."
m/1003017-brainstorm, The characters take such a secondary importance to the gadget that we never feel much for them.
m/1003060-breakout," I'd have liked Breakout more, I think, if it had been done as a flat-out thriller without the added touches."
m/1003075-brewsters_millions," Lame recycled flick that wants to be ""Arthur"" and ""Trading Places"" but isn't."
m/1003076-brians_song, Made-for-TV eyewash for disheartened Bears fans to drown their sorrows in.
m/1003094-brief_encounter," David Lean's Brief Encounter towers over the majority of romantic films, precisely because it calls the bluff of the genre's wish fulfillment."
m/1003119-broken_arrow, This massively influential western from director Delmer Daves was among the first to tell the native American side of the story.
m/1003120-broken_blossoms," Broken Blossoms (1919) is director D. W. Griffith's most tragic, serious, poetic, intricate, and melodramatic film. Griffith, considered the first master of feature film directors, made this powerful screen masterpiece. This silent film tells the story .."
m/1003136-brotherhood," The acting is memorable throughout - Douglas characteristically tense, Cord perfect as the smoother sibling and Adler menacing as the boss."
m/1003217-bug," The sluggish direction by Jeannot Szwarc keeps the events a little too serious, making the hollow dialogue sound even phonier."
m/1003276-burglar, One of Whoopi's laziest vehicles ... and she's done her share.
m/1003296-bus_stop, The Taming of the Shrew appears oddly depressing when re-imagined as a mid-century hick minstrel show
m/1003318-butch_cassidy_and_the_sundance_kid," Although Butch Cassidy wasn't the first movie to pair up a couple of wisecracking best friends in an action/adventure setting, this film became the model of how well that approach could work when done right."
m/1003399-calamity_jane," Poorly directed by David Butler, this musical version of Annie Get Your Gun, features the popular Oscar-winning song, Secret Love, sung by Doris Day."
m/1003436-camelot," Often so misguided that it threatens to become a spoof worthy of Monty Python or Mel Brooks -- when Arthur hisses, ""I demand a man's vengeance!"" he sounds exactly like Cloris Leachman bleating, ""Death to King Louis!"" in History of the World: Part I."
m/1003441-camille," The great Garbo at her radiant peak, and certainly among the top five most romantic movies ever made."
m/1003492-cape_fear," works best as a twisted nail-biter, punctuated brilliantly with an apocalyptic score by Bernard Herrmann"
m/1003499-captain_blood, The movie that launched both Flynn and the '30s cycle of swashbucklers.
m/1003612-carnival_of_souls," Com seu roteiro bvio e as pssimas atuaes,  incrivelmente inferior s numerosas produes que supostamente inspirou."
m/1003625-carrie, Here -- as in perhaps no other film -- De Palma's non-stop stylistic flourishes completely complement and enhance the proceedings.
m/1003707-casablanca," More an icon than a work of art, Casablanca is still thoroughly entertaining romantic melodrama, flawlessly directed, subtly played, lovingly evoking our collective daydreams about lost chances and lost loves and love versus honor."
m/1003722-casino_royale," So bizarre, so wrongheaded, and so overblown that it's actually enjoyable."
m/1003747-cat_and_the_canary," [This] adroitly atmospheric film is virtually an ideogram of narrative suspension and impact, and it's a lovely, musty, nightened place to visit."
m/1003755-cat_on_a_hot_tin_roof," The performances are the thing in this film version of the Tennessee Williams stage triumph, led by Ives, repeating his stage role like a force of nature."
m/1003757-cat_people," A Val Lewton classic that proves in horror, the less you show, the scarier the movie."
m/1003758-cat_people," The seductively exotic surface of this mythically underpinned fantasy might be offset for some by much graphic gore, but if you can buy the romantic metaphors for the primitivisms of sexual obsession, the film delivers down the line."
m/1003780-caught, ... belongs as much to the murky world of American film noir as to the polished European dramas of high society social appearances and power games.
m/1003854-champ," Even more of a tear-jerker than the 1931 version of the same story, there is not a dry eye on the screen."
m/1003857-champion," Robson's direction is all action, wasting no time in telling this compelling story, and Carl Foreman's script is sharply observant of the boxing milieu."
m/1003883-charade, Classy mystery that combines romance and comedy with a surprisingly suspenseful finish.
m/1003952-charlottes_web, the much-loved book loses nothing in its transfer to the screen
m/1003957-chase," Considering the sprawling cast of distinctive characters and personalities, The Chase remains a compact exercise in control."
m/1004047-children_of_the_corn," The only halfway decent installment of the entire bloated, pitiful franchise."
m/1004110-chosen," It shouldered its way into the popular consciousness, perhaps with a few concessions and a straining dramatic license, but nonetheless it remains a thoughtful, provocative engagement of legitimate issues relating to Judaism, the ancient, ever evolving rel"
m/1004125-christmas_carol, This is a timeless ode to Dikie- Look for the Barrymore version too...
m/1004141-christmas_in_connecticut, It's nothing that's going to change your life or anything but if you want a pleasant and romantic comedy that has some good laughs and some good chemistry it's a... really entertaining little Christmas movie.
m/1004151-christmas_story," Funny, charming, and built around a classic Darren McGavin performance"
m/1004177-cimarron, There's a reason Wesley Ruggles' movies aren't often revived and this is one of them.
m/1004330-cleopatra," Taylor, Burton, and Harrison are sublime in this sweeping epic of love and nations."
m/1004463-college," Madcap fun as the supremely athletic Keaton plays a bookworm who, for love of a jock-loving girl, tries but fails heroically at every possible sport in every possible way."
m/1004485-colors, It's an exhilarating sparring match between Duvall's workmanlike fine-tuning and Penn's raw energy.
m/1004502-coma, Crichton does Cook in this engaging (if dated) medical thriller.
m/1004567-commando, The big battle scenes are especially disappointing.
m/1004703-convoy," Convoy continues Peckinpah's voyage into ""nihilist poetry,"" in the phrase of Pauline Kael..."
m/1004790-countdown," The film seems oddly unfocused, and the first hour is given over to barren stretches of flat, everyday dialog."
m/1004832-cover_girl, It has Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth to sing and dance. And virtually every nook and corner is draped with beautiful girls.
m/1004906-creature_from_the_black_lagoon," The technical material is so good, in fact, that if you might actually like the movie... if you can ignore everything else."
m/1004995-crossroads," Meandering story with Ralph Macchio, mediocre Walter Hill."
m/1005152-damn_yankees," Terrific, Oscar-nominated score by Jerry Ross and Richard Adler is electric."
m/1005194-dangerous, Bette Davis won her first Oscar for playing an alcoholic actress bent on self-destruction.
m/1005199-dangerous_liaisons, Probably the best adaptation of the celebrated novel you can find.
m/1005242-dark_mirror, ...a fiendishly fun double role for Olivia de Havilland.
m/1005279-darling, Julie Christie thoroughly merited her Oscar as the immoral but vivacious starlet hellbent on fame and Dirk Bogarde as her TV journalist lover is equally splendid.
m/1005360-day_of_the_dead," Low-budget, scaled-down follow-up that doesn't really cut it."
m/1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still," Next time your parents tell you that they don't make them like they used to, believe them."
m/1005381-days_of_wine_and_roses," Except for the (fake) ending, this is one of Hollywood's best films about the devastating effects of alcoholism, going beyond Wilder's Lost Weekend, and proficiently helmed by Blake Edwards just before the Pink Panther films changed completely his career"
m/1005399-dead_heat," A real stinker in 1988, and it hasn't improved with age."
m/1005512-death_in_venice," Gorgeous, sumptuous, and slow as an arthritic turtle."
m/1005656-demons," It's repetitive and borderline pretentious, without the over-the-top looniness that distinguishes the better Italian splatter."
m/1005724-desperate_hours," William Wyler's masterly filming of the Joseph Hayes thriller makes most of the earlier versions look like minor-league efforts. Fredric March, as the beleaguered father, gives one of the year's finest acting performances."
m/1005865-dillinger, Warren really feels his oats as the title gangster of this gruesome but gripping true crime drama.
m/1005875-dinner_at_eight," It's a little rough around the edges, but the performances from these legendary actors really make this movie worthy of your time"
m/1006037-doctor_zhivago," When the bland epics of Sir Richard Attenborough and Roland Joffe are long forgotten, people will still be watching David Lean's work."
m/1006068-dolls, Feels like it was made by a trio of monkeys with a $20 budget.
m/1006207-dr_jekyll_and_mr_hyde," It is an engaging, old-fashioned movie, using the right blend of thoughtful artistry and matinee thrills, with a touch of eroticism to spice things up."
m/1006223-how_the_grinch_stole_christmas," Like fine wine, it just gets better every darn year."
m/1006234-dracula, Dracula (1931) is one of the earliest classic American horror films from Universal Pictures - an acclaimed masterpiece directed by Tod Browning
m/1006236-dracula," A handsome, moody rendition, more romantic than menacing."
m/1006250-dragnet," Yes, it is lowbrow and sophomoric. What you'd call dumb-de-dumb-dumb fun."
m/1006287-dream_team," A very underrated film, with Peter Boyle stealing the show."
m/1006299-dressed_to_kill," Originality has never been a high value in the genre-bound aesthetic of filmmaking, but De Palma cheapens what he steals."
m/1006345-duel, A sort of minimalist telepic precursor to John Dahl's Joyride that packs the unadulterated genre punch of pure grain alcohol...
m/1006364-dune," Beyond the problems with central roles, the film's real trouble stems from the fact that Lynch just wasn't the right man for the job."
m/1006392-eagle_has_landed," The film is a pretty dismal two hours of waiting for Lefty, who never appears. The Eagle Has Landed simply never takes off."
m/1006416-east_of_eden," East of Eden (1955) is an updated telling of the Biblical story of rival brothers, Cain and Abel and a paradise lost."
m/1006425-easy_money," If you are not a Dangerfield fan, of course, probably nothing on earth could induce you to go to this movie. The great Dangerfield movie, however, has still to be made. This one doesn't get quite enough respect."
m/1006438-eaten_alive," With an enviable, well-stocked cast of character thespians and a carefully dilapidated motel set, Eaten Alive is all ingredients, no recipe."
m/1006527-elephant_man, David Lynch does a neat turn with a straight drama.
m/1006646-enforcer, A solid third installment in the DIRTY HARRY series. Tyne Daly excellent as the flustered but competent female partner. Great final showdown with terrorists on Alcatraz.
m/1006717-escape_from_new_york, The genius of John Carpenter includes his subtlety in composition. The man has always known that the best special effects are invisible and never detract from the story.
m/1006872-exodus," The style of filmmaking is simply too polite and serene to carry the edgy, dangerous material of Uris's novel"
m/1006917-eyewitness," Every scene develops characters. And they're developed in such offbeat fidelity to the way people do behave that we get all the more involved in the mystery, just because, for once, we halfway believe it could really be happening."
m/1007003-fahrenheit_451," Fahrenheit 451 is made of scenes that are truly horrifying, some scenes that are filled with black humour and some scenes that are both."
m/1007073-fandango," Kevin Costner's Breakout Role, and the Road Trip to end all Road Trips."
m/1007105-far_from_the_madding_crowd," Finch, Bates, Stamp and particularly Christie are all mesmerising, while Nic Roeg's cinematography and the outdoor settings are breathtaking."
m/1007110-farewell_my_lovely, Truly fine neo-noir compares favorably with the 1944 version.
m/1007141-fatal_attraction," Because the good things in the movie -- including the performances -- are so very good, it's a shame that the film's potential for greatness was so blatantly compromised."
m/1007154-father_of_the_bride, This is one of the great dark comedies of the 1950s.
m/1007350-fire_and_ice," This animated fantasy from Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta is just a half-step above garbage, despite some cool elements."
m/1007517-flash_gordon, For most viewers Flash Gordon is the reason why phrases like 'guilty pleasure' entered vocabularies.
m/1007522-flashback," I'm reluctant to say what does happen, because the movie takes such an interesting U-turn into what develops into a halfway serious contrast between the values of the summer of love and the greed of the Me Decade."
m/1007538-flesh_and_blood, Ugly drama about the troubles during the dark Middle Ages.
m/1007555-flight_of_the_phoenix," It's a terrific and underrated action/adventure movie; especially compared to some of today's Summertime blockbuster ""thrillers."""
m/1007573-flipper, Good family movie is not just another fish story...or maybe it is.
m/1007600-fly," The Fly has, over the years, acquired the reputation as some sort of a classic. How this has been achieved I am afraid I am at a loss to explain."
m/1007602-fly," Solid and effective. Yeah, and it's pretty disgusting, too."
m/1007615-flying_tigers," Jingoistic, flag waving John Wayne action, circa 1942."
m/1007657-footloose," After a while you kind of go, 'Y'know, this isn't actually all that bad.'"
m/1007832-frantic, One of the best traditional thrillers to come down the pike in quite some time.
m/1007910-fright_night," It shouldn't even begin to work, and yet, strangely, it does, sort of, thanks to the assured handling of writer/director Holland."
m/1007931-from_here_to_eternity," Admittedly, it may be more of a guy's idea of a romantic film than a woman's. But it has a taut script and a letter-perfect cast."
m/1007949-frosty_the_snowman, It adds a new dimension to a fun Christmas song only Rankin Bass could have pulled off.
m/1007962-fugitive," Turgid, slow moving, lacking in dramatic tension, too grating and simplistic in its obvious religious symbols, and losing its moral urgency from the novel."
m/1007990-funny_farm, Middling star vehicle that wastes its director's talents.
m/1008015-fury, One of De Palma's flawed-yet-fascinating early experiments.
m/1008055-galaxy_of_terror, One thing's for certain ... it's a great time to be a Roger Corman fan.
m/1008074-gallipoli," Against a backdrop broader than his previous outings, Weir has fashioned what is virtually an intimate epic."
m/1008080-gambler, James Caan is unforgettable in this tense examination of a college professor who can't stop gambling. One of the many overlooked gems of the 1970s.
m/1008085-game_of_death," ...the standard of the choreography is excellent, and the final 20 minutes - which are almost all of Bruce fighting - are well worth holding out for."
m/1008166-general," An imaginative masterpiece of dead-pan ""Stone-Face"" Buster Keaton comedy, the silent Civil War adventure epic classic, The General (1927)"
m/1008243-getaway, A tough crime drama with a steely McQueen performance and the usual quota of Peckinpah violence.
m/1008358-girls_girls_girls," A vacuous but commercially shrewd Hollywood comedy-with-songs indicating that Elvis Presley, now 28, has succeeded in building up a new ""image"" almost totally different from the unkempt, loose-hipped hillbilly of 1956."
m/1008407-gloria, One of Cassavetes' most accessible and involving movies.
m/1008415-glory, The lasting power of the [film]... rests in the emotional connection to the characters .
m/1008588-gone_in_60_seconds," Halicki may know car chases, but he doesn't really know anything about dramatic filmmaking"
m/1008623-goodbye_girl," Dreyfuss' Oscar-winning performance and the chemistry between him and Mason, + Neil Simon script make this an entertaining watch."
m/1008627-goodbye_mr_chips," Start with It's a Wonderful Life and take away Christmas and all the bad stuff that happens, and you've got this movie."
m/1008799-great_gatsby," ...an opulent, stylish extravaganza that may be more faithful to the 'look' of Fitzgerald's novel than to its spirit, yet brings a good deal of entertainment along the way."
m/1008931-green_berets, John Wayne fans - particularly the fans of his war films - will like this movie for the chance to see him mix it up with heavy artillery.
m/1008968-grizzly," As a drive-in-level guilty pleasure of the most obvious and brainless variety, Grizzly is quite a bit of good, campy fun."
m/1008981-group, A high-class soap opera about eight women graduates in 1933 from Vassar.
m/1009027-gullivers_travels," Dated animated adaptation, with some cartoon violence."
m/1009096-hairspray," The world is coming to an end: cracks are forming in the Earth's surface, mountain-sized chunks of ice are falling from the sky, John Waters has made a family film."
m/1009113-halloween," Considered by many to be a modern horror classic, Halloween succeeds through simplicity."
m/1009123-hamlet," Olivier's Hamlet is terrific to watch and his performance is great but, like the play, the film is somewhat tedious."
m/1009211-hard_times, Rough and grim knuckle-fighting drama headlining Charles Bronson.
m/1009219-hardcore, ...a compelling and often shocking drama that also succeeds as a time capsule of a very specific time and place.
m/1009224-harder_they_fall, A lousy racket lurking around some of the prize fighting arenas of the country is being depicted in one of the most gripping films to come out of Hollywood crucible.
m/1009277-haunting," The Haunting is a wisely sophisticated horror film of implication, subtlety, and restraint. Watching it now, after roughly three decades of consistently visceral horror films, is speculatively as frightening an experience as it was forty years ago."
m/1009293-hawaii," [Hill] fights a losing battle to keep the sprawling story in check but, aided by his cast, imbues the piece with the stormy passion that this mammoth production requires."
m/1009427-heaven_can_wait," Unnecessary, charmless remake of Here Comes Mr.Jordan."
m/1009437-heidi," It's far from being a personal work, but as always with Dwan, it's the best movie imaginable from the limited material at hand."
m/1009583-hidden_fortress," The Hidden Fortress effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy."
m/1009645-hills_have_eyes," There's a difference between reiterating a theme and repeating what worked before, and you feel the line drawn here."
m/1009649-hindenburg, Blimpy make believe script surrounding a true disaster.
m/1009691-hit, Superb acting from Hurt and Stamp is enough to smooth over any rough patches.
m/1009736-hole_in_the_head," Capra's next to last film, a tale of a widower and his young son, is not up to his level but the film is entertaining due to the star turn of Frank Sinatra, and of course the popular Oscar-winning tune ""High Hopes,"" which he sings."
m/1009972-hot_pursuit," Riddled with clichs, overdone plot devices, weak character motivations, flimsy characters and stilted, corny dialogue."
m/100_bloody_acres_2013," One sees a film called 100 Bloody Acres expecting the requisite allusions to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but an homage to the best scene in Melvin and Howard comes as something of a shock."
m/100_streets," It's not Altman, but its heart is in the right place and Drameh impresses."
m/1010002-hound_of_the_baskervilles," A bit more Hollywood than Arthur Conan Doyle might have envisioned, but darned entertaining nonetheless."
m/1010004-hound_of_the_baskervilles, They don't make Sherlock Holmes films better than this superbly cast and told 1959 version from Hammer Studios...
m/1010012-house, A guy running around in a monster suit isn't enough to sustain a full-length horror flick...
m/1010030-house_of_wax, The first 3-D feature in WarnerColor and with Warner-Phonic sound is a magnificently macabre thriller and far superior to the earlier 3-D efforts.
m/1010034-house_on_haunted_hill," Anyone for goose pimples? If so, there is a plethora of such epidermal elevations in this entry in to the apparently endless cycle of horror plays with which the world's screens are currently being flooded."
m/1010174-hud, Patricia Neal delivers a subtle and sensual Oscar-winning performance.
m/1010202-human_factor," This rigorous, compelling, radically stylized film represents the end point in a line of development that Otto Preminger had been pursuing since the late 60s."
m/1010214-hunchback_of_notre_dame," It's a total physical transformation that's often stunning to behold, selling effective make-up effects and behavior extremes with real gusto."
m/1010215-hunchback_of_notre_dame," Charles Laughton gives a riveting, haunting perfromance in this atmospheric, Oscar-nominated version, previously shot in 1923 with Lon Chaney and in 1957 with Anthony Quinn."
m/1010249-hustle, ...plays like nothing more than a vanity project for star Burt Reynolds.
m/1010263-i_the_jury," The film soon becomes repetitious, lacking the overall atmosphere of paranoia that makes Spillane's fictions bearable."
m/1010417-imitation_of_life," The ultimate Sirk film, the contradictions breaking the back of the melodrama genre for all time and Sirk gobbling up and spitting out his Hollywood career like a badger devouring its young."
m/1010431-importance_of_being_earnest, All the charm and glossy humor of Oscar Wilde's classic comedy emerges faithfully in this British production.
m/1010448-in_cold_blood, An uneasy mixture of facile Freudianism and 40s expressionism.
m/1010526-incubus, it forces you to constantly wonder whether it's so disturbing because it was meant to be ... or if it because of ineptitude on the filmmaker's part.
m/1010540-indiscreet, A classy romantic comedy that's also touching and poignant. Another successful Grant/Bergman union.
m/1010553-informer, The Informer remains a keenly moving film experience.
m/1010555-inherit_the_wind," Producer-director Stanley Kramer ably handles the incendiary material visually, making good use of deep focus and careful compositions"
m/1010644-intolerance," One of the great breakthroughs -- the Ulysses of the cinema -- and a powerful, moving experience in its own right."
m/1010673-invaders_from_mars," 'Marines have no qualms about killing Martians, son,' is my favourite line of dialogue from this movie . . ."
m/1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers," Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) is a thrilling, disturbing classic science fiction/alien film from veteran producer Walter Wanger. It was originally based upon a three-part serial story written by Jack Finney that appeared in Colliers Magazine"
m/1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers," For once, a great remake, smartly executed. Great performances and a killing ending that will stay with you forever can't hurt, either."
m/1010695-invisible_man, The strangest character yet created by the screen roams through The Invisible Man.
m/1010752-island_of_dr_moreau," A quietly durable interpretation of Wells' classic, and a big step up from the Brando version."
m/1010762-islands_in_the_stream," Uneven, but fascinating version of the Hemmingway novel with strong performances."
m/1010770-it, Clarence Badger's romantic comedy It maintains its charm with witty camerawork and a powerhouse performance by the lovely Clara Bow.
m/1010793-its_alive," You wouldn't want to confuse what Cohen does for art, but for its genre It's Alive! manages a few neat tricks"
m/1010824-ivanhoe," By standrads of the 1950s, this is a passably entertaining period adventure, representing Hollywood's effort to fight the competition from the new and threatening medium of TV."
m/1010849-jack_frost," Nearing the absolute maximum threshold for strange, vaguely European mythical spirits and the dark magic they wield, ""Jack Frost"" is certainly more screwed up than it is festive."
m/1010889-jamaica_inn, Hitchcock's final British film before leaving for the States and a second career is a disappointing and an uncharacteristic romantic melodrama.
m/1010939-jason_and_the_argonauts," Great fun, as these things go, with a Bernard Herrmann score to boot."
m/1010978-jazz_singer, Warner Bros.' The Jazz Singer (1927) is an historic milestone film and cinematic landmark. [Most people associate this film with the advent of sound pictures.]
m/1010979-jazz_singer, An unintentional laff riot. Olivier is so over the top that it's mesmerizing.
m/1011028-jesus_christ_superstar," Like a baptism by fire, Jesus Christ Superstar rarely leaves the viewer in lukewarm waters"
m/1011176-johnny_belinda, Powerful Jane Wyman performance and Oscar caliber production overall.
m/1011295-judex," a lot of fun, especially for discerning cinephiles who know their film history"
m/1011328-julius_caesar," Brando shows some surprising flair with the Tudor dialogue, but this adaptation needs a little brushing up."
m/1011338-jungle_book," It's a formless, often dull time, but the verdant Technicolor (shot by Lee Garmes) gives it a nice gloss."
m/1011487-kickboxer," Van Damme tries once again to dispel the notion that he can't act and is nothing more than muscles on muscles, but his efforts are in vain."
m/1011495-kid_galahad," Elvis wanted to spread his wings, and he clearly had the chops. Unfortunately, the films just wouldn't let him."
m/1011605-king_and_i," If you don't...see [The King and I], believe us, you'll be missing a grand and moving thing."
m/1011615-king_kong, The greatest classic adventure-fantasy (and part-horror) film of all time is King Kong (1933). Producers/directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack
m/1011617-king_kong, Dino de Laurentis se atrevi a hacer lo que muy pocos tienen las agallas de intentar: realizar el remake de un clsico por antonomasia: King Kong.
m/1011623-king_of_comedy," It's very funny, and it ends on a high note that was, for me, both a total surprise and completely satisfying. Yet it's also bristly, sometimes manic to the edge of lunacy and, along the way, terrifying."
m/1011626-king_of_kings," ... whereas detractors dismissed the films as I Was a Teenage Jesus, it's more accurate to describe it as Rebel With a Cause."
m/1011813-lady_vanishes," If you can keep from yelling at the screen, you are a better person than I."
m/1011818-ladykillers," As directed in a kind of damp, gray color palette by Alexander Mackendrick the film is one of the richest and most carefully-paced of the Ealing comedies."
m/1012007-laura," Preminger's deft direction creates an elegant noirish tone, and he elicits near-perfect performances from everyone, even a pre-Horror Schlock Vincent Pryce."
m/1012164-legend," Like many recent sword and sorcery movies, it is so effective in rendering evil, so good at depicting the dire, bleak fates facing the heroes, that it's too dreary and gloomy for its own good."
m/1012225-les_miserables, ... the most respected and revered screen adaptation...
m/1012264-letter," If there is any doubt that Bette Davis is the star of this film, high above all others, it is vanquished by William Wyler's careful framing of her in every shot."
m/1012370-lilies_of_the_field," Lilies is a humble and humorous tribute to pride, faith, and perseverance, and that's more than enough. Amen."
m/1012386-lion_in_winter," Director Anthony Harvey opened up Goldman's play into authentic spaces far from any proscenium, and remained faithful to an energetic drama propelled by its performances and dialogue."
m/1012419-little_drummer_boy," The drummer boy is a misanthrope who hates all of humanity, which makes for a surprisingly entertaining character to follow around. Rankin/Bass was terrified of playing up the darker sides of its characters. It shouldn't have been."
m/1012506-little_romance," A perfect combination of elements: engaging performances, romantic European locations, a buoyant score and a smart, observant screenplay"
m/1012514-little_shop_of_horrors, A campy Corman classic. Drink some beers and have fun with it!
m/1012515-little_shop_of_horrors, One of the most memorable viewing experiences of the previous decade.
m/1012524-little_women," Part comedy of manners, part morality tale, Little Women is more interested in its heroines ""conquering themselves"" than in a man conquering their hearts."
m/1012525-little_women, The film never survives its horrifically cheesy tone. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/1012605-lock_up, has more in common with the litany of weak films from the 90s than with his powerful flicks
m/1012611-lolita, ...a rather sanitized but effectively engaging black comedy.
m/1012647-long_days_journey_into_night," O'Neill's greatest play is brought to the screen with an overpowering wealth of talent: Hepburn, Richardson, and Robards give magnificent, once-in-a-lifetime performances as members of the doomed Tyrone family."
m/1012662-long_hot_summer," O belo roteiro, escrito a partir de histrias de William Faulkner, ganha ainda mais dimenso graas s performances de Newman, Woodward e Welles - alm,  claro, da direo segura de Martin Ritt e da tima fotografia."
m/1012665-longest_yard," ...gives us a glance of Reynolds when he still had potential, before he totally gave himself over to grin and giggle junk."
m/1012672-look_back_in_anger," As belas performances (especialmente de Burton) e a opressora fotografia so os principais atrativos do filme, que, graas aos seus personagens neurticos e deprimentes, torna-se uma experincia nada agradvel."
m/1012772-lost_patrol, Ford and his longtime screenwriter Dudley Nichols center on character interaction and keep the action mainly off-camera for a startlingly tense film.
m/1012813-love_bug," The first of the silly VW Beetle with a cute personality comedies, is as childish dated and occasionally sweet as the others."
m/1012920-lust_for_life," The movie, attractive as it may be, never 'breaks through the iron wall' between what is felt and what is expressed, the very wall that van Gogh himself strove to overcome."
m/1012928-m," Images of Lorre's oversized, fearful eyes and the yanking of children from the streets by protective parents set the mood of this picture more effectively than any dialogue could."
m/1013004-made_in_heaven, An absolutely divine experience. You'll never forget it.
m/1013035-magic_flute," This film is stunning to look at, with wonderful sets, interesting costumes, and yet another work of gorgeous cinematography by Bergman fave, Sven Nykvist."
m/1013071-magnificent_ambersons," Even with so many cuts reducing the final third to a frustrating mish-mash of disjointed segments, it retains the occasional power to mesmerize and amaze."
m/1013077-magnificent_seven, The theme music is perfect. It's a rousing score that will stick in your head.
m/1013089-main_event," The plot is reminiscent of 1930 s comedies, but Streisand and [producer] Jon Peters have provided a handsome, up-to-date production."
m/1013139-maltese_falcon, A must-see for anyone who wants to see a classic film the way they used to make 'em.
m/1013162-man_for_all_seasons," It will not be for all tastes, but it is a fine film."

m/1013238-manhattan_project, There was something absorbing about these nuclear scientists doing their job.
m/1013248-manhunter," This is an overlooked but superior thriller, one of the best films from the 1980s."
m/1013259-mannequin," There`s some solid talent here, but Gottlieb's overemphatic direction reduces them all to broad caricature -- the kind of crazed mugging that isn't often seen outside the boundaries of Saturday morning kiddie shows."
m/1013427-marty," One of the most amazing portrayals of an average Shmoe you could ever imagine. Ernest Borgnine is lovable, disgusting, creepy and just a great guy."
m/1013632-mechanic," ...a meandering, relentlessly unwatchable piece of work."
m/1013711-men," This was Marlon Brando's film debut and, as such, set standards not only for his fellow actors but for himself."
m/1013772-meteor," Entertaining, but only in an ""OMG is this stupid!"" sort of way."
m/1013775-metropolis," A haunting vision, with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations."
m/1013884-mighty_joe_young," Great Willis O'Brien effects, a good story and fine cast. A wonderful fantasy, not as good as King Kong, but still fun to watch."
m/1013973-miracle_worker," Where the picture really excels, outside of its inherent story values, is in the realm of photographic technique."
m/1014027-mission," ""The Mission"" effectively dramatizes yet another chapter in the ruthless European conquest of the Americas. It'll make you hate the whole of western civilization with every fiber of your being."
m/1014061-mister_roberts," The setting is a supply ship in the war torn Pacific, but there's little action and the piece soon wears out what little welcome it might have had."
m/1014090-moby_dick, A rolling and thundering color film that is herewith devoutly recommended as one of the great motion pictures of our times.
m/1014137-monkey_business, ...allows for a welcome bit of personal space between the audience and the comedians' antics.
m/1014138-monkey_business, Cute comedy with a nice early appearance by Marilyn Monroe.
m/1014217-moonraker," ...one of the better of Moore's Bond flicks, complemented by its exotic locales and outer-space motif."
m/1014294-moulin_rouge," A beautifully shot, measured movie that never really builds up enough sympathy for Lautrec to really move viewers."
m/1014325-mr_and_mrs_smith, Many 'minor' Hitchcocks turn out to be intriguing films once you forgive them for not being thrillers.
m/1014370-mummy," Poetic, brilliant, creepy horror classic with a great Karloff performance"
m/1014372-mummy, Rehash of The Mummy and The Mummy's Tomb lacking the atmosphere of either.
m/1014396-murder, Perhaps the most provocative of all early British Hitchcocks.
m/1014453-music_man, Robert Preston is note-perfect in a bright musical even non-fans of the genre will enjoy.
m/1014481-mutiny_on_the_bounty, One of the most durable and engrossing adventure films ever made.
m/1014482-mutiny_on_the_bounty, Its picture postcard scenery couldn't hide how colorless the film felt at times.
m/1014536-my_man_godfrey," One of the most enchanting and poignant screwball comedies of all time, La Cava's zany film reflects the zeitgeist of the Depression and is supremely acted by William Powell, Carol Lombard and the rest of the ensemble."
m/1014592-mysterious_island, Watchable only because of the terrific stop-motion animation of Ray Harryhausen.
m/1014793-near_dark," Near Dark remains Kathryn Bigelow's best film, suffused with style and anarchy that has an unerring feel for the irregular pulse of a very particular place and time."
m/1014986-nicholas_and_alexandra, [Features] eye-pleasing production design and costumes.
m/1015000-night_and_day, To demur that it let a few false notes get into Porter's life story is merely querulousness that will never enter the heads or the reactions of the multitudes who will enjoy it.
m/1015002-night_at_the_opera," A Night at the Opera (1935), a musical comedy, is the sixth of thirteen Marx Brothers films, and their first for MGM Studios under Irving Thalberg's production."
m/1015052-night_of_the_living_dead," Shocks come from the way in which Romero repeatedly presents a clichd situations in which we think we know what's going on, only for Romero to pull out the rug from underneath, thereby producing a greater shock."
m/1015079-night_to_remember," [A Night to Remember] is a motion picture that will long be remembered for the manner in which it has dramatized cold fact, and given the suspense and the excitement usually engendered only by fiction."
m/1015095-nighthawks," While the plotting is familiar (especially after countless imitations), competent scripting, direction and acting make this above average entertainment."
m/1015218-no_way_out, In thriller terms it's close to irresistible and enormously entertaining.
m/1015348-nutty_professor," The Nutty Professor was not only a starring vehicle for Lewis, the comedian, it was also co-written and directed by the star and shows, intentionally and deliberately, two drastically different sides of him."
m/1015361-obsession," Subtlety is a not a term that can often be applied to DePalma's work, but it's this uncharacteristic restraint that helps make ""Obsession"" his masterpiece."
m/1015380-odd_couple, What's not to like about this classic film which features two of our most beloved actors at their best?
m/1015389-odessa_file," Voight's performance gives credibility to his character's obsession, but even that cannot overcome the discrepancy between the deeper themes and the routine nature of this piece of box-office action adventure."
m/1015517-omen, Creepy horror classic that's just plain fun to watch.
m/1015530-on_the_beach," Typically overlong Kramer film, but still with some power."
m/1015542-on_the_town," Disappointingly flat musical; if you're after a Kelly/Sinatra pairing, you'll do better with Anchors Aweigh (and even that is no masterpiece)."
m/1015639-only_when_i_laugh," Only When I Laugh is a film about family ties, friendship and coping in a competitive world."
m/1015737-our_town, today it seems quite dated in its theatrical clunkiness
m/1015944-parent_trap, Great production values... and a surprising sense of humor
m/1016119-pennies_from_heaven," he point is made endlessly, though it's in the film's favor that it's made with seriousness, consideration, and a certain amount of imagination."
m/1016213-peter_pan, Disney's depersonalizing habit of putting different teams in charge of different sections of the story really shows up here.
m/1016239-phantom_of_the_opera, The big climax intended as a surprise reveal is just drawn out and lackluster.
m/1016240-phantom_of_the_opera," Who needs sound, color or even opera? We have Lon Chaney at his peak and that is more than sufficient."
m/1016302-picture_of_dorian_gray, Stradling demonstrates his mastery of deep-focus photography and scenic composition...
m/1016338-pink_panther, Clouseau (Sellers) is...a character that must go down as one of the great comic creations in motion picture history.
m/1016359-piranha," Essentially, Piranha is the best example of how to do a B-movie knockoff."
m/1016365-pirates_of_penzance," The cast is charming, the sets intentionally stagy, and the musical performances fine."
m/1016369-pit_and_the_pendulum," It reminds us that flat, colorless character actors look really flat and colorless when sharing a scene with Price."
m/1016397-planet_of_the_apes, A magnificently indignant Heston ... wrestles with the imponderables of a topsy-turvy world in which apes reign over humankind.
m/1016479-point_blank," Scary and exciting at the same time, establishing Lee Marvin as the original Terminator."
m/1016512-pollyanna, Eleanor H. Porter's 1913 best-seller about a relentlessly cheerful little girl has been turned into an astonishingly pleasant movie under Walt Disney's supervision.
m/1016513-poltergeist," Repeat viewings are best spread out over time and the film's internal logic doesn't entirely hold up, but if you just accept the action for the rollercoaster ride it is, it can be fairly satisfying"
m/1016534-popeye," Altman's job was to convey the spirit of the old cartoons, not dish up some ultraslick Hollywood sitcom fodder. He gets the job done right."
m/1016584-poseidon_adventure, probably the best of Hollywood's seventies-style disaster hokum
m/1016586-posse, Posse is so busy trying to live up to its self-avowed intention to be relevant that it hardly has time to be its own movie.
m/1016591-postman_always_rings_twice, Gripping tale doubles as allegory about exploited workers and economic revolt.
m/1016592-postman_always_rings_twice," Not as good as the original, but not entirely dismissable"
m/1016698-pride_and_prejudice," Sometimes Leonard gets the details wrong -- the costumes and sets seem more at home in a late Victorian setting than in Austen's early 19th century -- but the overall effect is truthful, transporting us to a world different from but related to our own."
m/1016724-prince_and_the_pauper, It's a sort of Tom Sawyer-Huckleberry Finn adventure in a royal sixteenth-century setting.
m/1016760-prisoner, This could've been a fascinating look at the interplay between two very different men...but Bridget Boland's screenplay utilizes the most stilted dialogue imaginable.
m/1016819-producers," It's childlike in its silliness, adult in its message of how utterly idiotic starting WWII was, and downright brilliant besides."
m/1016832-project_x," ""Project X"" reflects quality and care throughout, but its elements don't quite mesh."
m/1016834-prom_night," By the time the killer fully emerges from the shadows, clad head to toe in black, leaping around like some Filipino ripoff of Spider-Man 3, the game is pretty much lost."
m/1016837-promised_land, The refreshingly simple storytelling and authentic small town feel makes it a very special film indeed.
m/1016842-prophecy," Too bad the ambitious pic was so poorly made and also so lacking in entertainment value, because there's a good sci-fi story here if done right."
m/1016854-prowler," A film with these specific strengths ought to be at least worth it for the [slasher] genre faithful, and it is - but it is solely for the faithful."
m/1016885-public_enemy, The Public Enemy (1931) is one of the earliest and best of the gangster films - the second one from Warner Bros. in the thirties. Director William Wellman's
m/1017021-quo_vadis," Super MGM spectacular, Roman style, headlining Robert Taylor."
m/1017123-raisin_in_the_sun, Fine adaptation of stage play giving Poitier one of his first hits.
m/1017237-razors_edge," Often pushing against Production Code limits, it is a fine execution of the novel"
m/1017238-razors_edge," Were it paced more smoothly, and if the lead character's spiritual search was developed instead of just hinted at, this could have been a great film."
m/1017289-rear_window," Although it's an intensely intimate film, there's something special about taking your seat in the theater as though you're pulling up right next to L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart)."
m/1017306-reckless," First-time director James Foley has made a drooling, teen-sex film dressed up as Rebel Without a Cause."
m/1017321-red_dawn," Red-baiting pablum about some Brat Packers, here dubbed the Wolverines, who rescue Colorado from a Soviet occupation. Risibly bad, jingoistic, and often laughable to boot."
m/1017328-red_heat, Hill's confidence keeps the formulaic buddy-cop cliches entertaining.
m/1017346-red_shoes," If you love dance, and music, and movies, treat yourself this weekend to The Red Shoes."
m/1017352-red_sonja," It's a truly horrible concoction, filled with stiff, overly serious dialogue, wretched performances, bad lighting and a lazy score by the otherwise great Ennio Morricone."
m/1017410-repentance, It's worth more for its daring political statement against the totalitarian Soviet regime of Stalin than as a work of moving satire.
m/1017488-return_to_oz," On its own merits, has some very fine cinematic flourishes... if we can but manage the herculean feat of separating it from the older movie."
m/1017530-rich_and_famous," It contains scenes that make you want to squirm because of their awkwardness and awfulness, and yet you don't want to look away and you're not bored."
m/1017641-risky_business, The roots of American Beauty can all be found in this groundbreaking film.
m/1017666-road_house," ...it's hard to go wrong with a film that features such choice bits of dialogue as ""nobody ever wins a fight,"" ""be nice until it's time to not be nice,"" and, of course, ""pain don't hurt."""
m/1017699-robin_hood, It's good for that time period from which the Disney studios were struggling to make good animated pictures.
m/1017712-robocop, Great effects and a nasty undercurrent drive this vehicle.
m/1017745-rock_n_roll_high_school, What punk rock lovin' fiend doesn't love the Ramones?
m/1017776-rocky, As perfect a fit of star to role as any in cinematic history.
m/1017834-romeo_and_juliet, Still the best adaptation of Shakespeare's most popular effort
m/1017962-rudolph_the_rednosed_reindeer," A holiday must-watch (if your kids aren't scared silly by the Abominable Snowman, as I was)."
m/1017991-runaway, Mr. Crichton has a much better feel for the film's gadgets than for its human players.
m/1018044-sabotage, The individual genius of Hitchcock is very clearly shown in the distinctive and original direction.
m/1018047-sabrina," All in all, Sabrina is an intelligent, mildly entertaining also-ran."
m/1018315-scanners," The film is awkward and, at its worst, listless and meandering."
m/1018318-scarecrow, Schatzberg throws away the more interesting implications in order to make emotional hay.
m/1018323-scarface," Scarface is unquestionably one of the greatest talking American movies ever made, and has been terribly underrated all through this century."
m/1018413-scrooge," Director Ronald Neame's well-paced film captures the period beautifully, and the acting is superb, with Finney and Alec Guinness, as Marley's ghost, real standouts."
m/1018433-sea_hawk," ...romance, adventure, and intrigue; lavish costumes and sets; heroes and scoundrels aplenty; and Errol Flynn swinging from ship to ship. What more could you ask for?"
m/1018550-see_no_evil, The picture is a nice little chiller. It's a formula movie and while it is easy enough to put down formula films there's nothing quite like them when they work. See No Evil works.
m/1018587-separate_tables," Deborah Kerr, her beauty hidden under the mousy façade of a faded and timid spinster, proves again that she is one of the finest actresses on the international screen."
m/1018688-shadow_of_a_doubt," Thanks in no small part to its precision acting, it's easily as great as other Hitchcock films to which 'masterpiece' status is more colloquially granted."
m/1018699-shaft, Shaft laid the ground for modern black filmmakers and addressed scenarios that even today don't make the cut.
m/1018702-shaggy_dog," The Shaggy Dog may have been made strictly for kids, but it is still cute enough for adults to get a kick out of."
m/1018704-shakedown," A rollicking, thrilling and funny police picture that makes ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and its sequel look as if they were photographed in slow motion."
m/1018885-shooting," The film's ending is a favorite amongst cultists and it acts as the paradigm of Camus' thinking: stoic, but humane, and advocating nature over violence."
m/1018891-short_circuit, Very entertaining sci-fi drama about the adventures of an escaped robot on the loose.
m/1018909-shot_in_the_dark, Classic Sellers. Hilarious from beginning to end; but only if you watch it drunk or at 3 AM
m/1018989-silent_night_deadly_night," We're not knocking the transformation of a hallowed holiday figure into a homicidal maniac...it's the pleasure Billy and the movie take in leering at, then dicing up young women that lands Charles E. Sellier Jr.'s sicko Santa on our worst list."
m/1018994-silent_partner," An uncommonly clever and gripping suspense thriller. Even after the story threatens to self-destruct, you fight the impulse to suffer a major letdown, for the sake of the swell nerve-racking time you've been having up to that point."
m/1019017-silver_streak," Hitchcockian in nature, the film goes down very pleasantly with just the right mix of humor and suspense."
m/1019026-simon, Simon is propelled by a witty screenplay and the energetic brio of Alan Arkin in the lead role.
m/1019045-sinbad_the_sailor," Colorful, sprightly actioner with Fairbanks at his best."
m/1019128-skin_deep, This is not exactly sophisticated or cerebral humor. Nor is it romantic in the least.
m/1019187-sleeping_beauty," Suffused with celestial metaphors and flights of visual fancy informed by pre-Renaissance art, the economical story is played for cosmic pathos and staged as pagan ritual."
m/1019441-sorcerer, The film could never shake the dark cloud that hung over its head.
m/1019544-spartacus, [A] very attractive film because it doesn't lack spectacle.
m/1019641-splash, Its appeal is based almost entirely on regression -- a thematic regression to infancy and a stylistic regression to the most lulling kind of TV blandness.
m/1019761-1019761-st_valentines_day_massacre," It's a cool, violent film, romantic in a disciplined, disenchanted way about its battling gangsters."
m/1019774-stagecoach," One of the best Westerns ever made, Ford's Stagecoach is a very stylized work, shot in black-and-white and influenced by German Expressionism. Sharply written by Dudley Nichols, it features strong characterizations well-played by the entire ensemble."
m/1019777-stage_fright, Even a lesser Hitchcock film is as good as a great film by nearly anyone else.
m/1019779-stakeout," Dreyfuss and his style are the two best things in ""Stakeout,"" a movie that consists of a good idea surrounded by a bad one."
m/1019829-star_is_born," Judy Garland is at her peak, pulling out all the stops, daring the gods in this dark, weighty fable of the price one pays to be at the top."
m/1019831-star_is_born," A transistorized remake, louder than ever, but very small in terms of its being about anything whatsoever."
m/101_dalmatians," Dog-lovers, in particular, will go ga-ga for this, but this remarkably fresh and funny period tale (set in England, fact fans) has all the ebullience and lovability of its titular characters."
m/101_dalmatians_ii_patchs_london_adventure," A sorry excuse for a straight-to-video movie, even by the standards of the rest of the sequels."
m/1020130-sting," A wonderful caper film that the first-time out has you guessing what comes next. Unfortunately, it does not hold up on repeated viewings with all the surprises gone."
m/1020287-stranger, Comes up short as far as believability due to the lame script.
m/1020333-streetcar_named_desire," Thanks to the excellent text and superb actors, Kazan managed to create a very good film, but he still failed to turn it into genuine and everlasting masterpiece."
m/1020415-suddenly, If you remove the hokum--the overly obvious and period-wholesome nonsense that frames the main narrative--Suddenly is a taut thriller in the Key Largo mold.
m/1020451-summer_school," The moral is a sweet one: If you try, you never fail. The world is graded on a curve."
m/1020479-sundowners," This sprawling, often boring saga of Aussie nomads in the 1920s is directed by Zinnemann with his customary tamed discipline and human realism, elevated by the solid ensemble."
m/1020488-sunshine_boys," The movie itself is a bit lackluster (clever dialogue, but it really goes on and on and on...)."
m/1020659-suspect," Suspect is a well-made thriller, but it was spoiled for me by an extraordinary closing scene where Cher, as the defense attorney, solves the case with all of the logic of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat."
m/1020660-suspicion," Hitchcock piles on the tension in the way that only he knows how, skilfully building to the sensational finale."
m/1020664-svengali, Vintage old-fashioned psychological melodrama about the evil use of mind-control.
m/1020684-sweet_bird_of_youth," Brooks' direction seems a little too stolid for all the sleazy, flaming passions. These are, however, given full measure by an excellent cast."
m/1020729-swing_time, Arguably the most magical of the ten films Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made together.
m/1020736-swiss_family_robinson," With mom's parasols and dad's water wheel inventions, this family looks like the original inhabitants of Gilligan's Island. Of course, this is not meant to be a comedy..."
m/1020861-taming_of_the_shrew, Fine Zeffirelli version with Taylor and Burton in good form.
m/1020889-target, The plot creaks along and nothing Penn does can align it.
m/1020897-tarzan_the_ape_man," To describe the film as inept would be to miss the point, which is to present Mrs. Derek in as many different poses, nude and seminude, as there are days of the year, all in something less than two hours."
m/1021008-tempest," Mazursky lets it all run too long, by a half-hour at least, but he also offers a menu of rare delights."
m/1021014-ten_commandments," DeMille's trademark sensibility aside, the two sections illustrate what the director gave up in his transformation into epic moviemaker."
m/1021015-ten_commandments, ...there is something touching in the mechanical hauteur of some of the performances.
m/1021067-terror," Among the least of the Corman-Price Poe pictures, but rendered imperishable by its hilarious/horrific wine-tasting scene between Peter Lorre and Vincent Price."
m/1021128-that_championship_season," A hard-hitting, brooding drama about sports that lances the American myth of competition and winning."
m/1021186-them," It isn't all that bad, except when the ants themselves show up."
m/1021211-shivers, ...the movie has a low-key immediacy to it that makes the perversions of its milieu all the more distressing.
m/1021214-they_drive_by_night, [Walsh's] personal response to the material puts it across.
m/1021230-thief, A slick Chicago crime-drama with a well-developed sense of pathos running throughout.
m/1021242-thing," Howard Hawks only produced this classic scary sci-fi feature, but it has his signature touches all over it: overlapping dialogue, smooth storytelling, compressed time and space."
m/1021244-thing," Genuinely scary and full of tension, and populated by one bad-ass monster."
m/1021269-this_gun_for_hire, This is the film noir that made Alan Ladd a hot star after many years as a struggling actor.
m/1021312-three_amigos," It's a calamity of a comedy, the perfect complement to concession-stand nachos con cheez."
m/1021316-three_brothers, Three Brothers shows how societal violence is a toxin in the lives of these characters.
m/1021500-time_machine," Probably edgy and thrilling in its day, The Time Machine hasn't aged so well."
m/1021648-tommy," One thing is sure: there has never been a movie musical quite like Tommy, a weird, crazy, wonderfully excessive version of The Who's rock opera."
m/1021681-toolbox_murders," Cameron Mitchell, playing the masked psycho, delivers one of the most obnoxious performances ever in a horror movie..."
m/1021699-top_secret, Another piece of loony bin entertainment from the Abrahams-Zucker chuckle factory...inspired in its wickedly silly-minded skin
m/1021721-torso," While maybe not the masterpiece Tarantino thinks it is, Torso is nonetheless entertaining for just about the whole of its running time."
m/1021749-touch_of_evil, the camera work and blocking have the coordination of an Olympic pole vaulter
m/1021765-tough_guys, A highly entertaining buddy comedy with two legendary stars in top form.
m/1021963-treasure_island, Swell production of Stevenson's classic. Some knock-out sailingship shots; a prize gallery of rough-neck facial make-ups.
m/1022001-trial," It is, for anyone curious about the undiscovered territory in Welles' body of work, his most touching film."
m/1022024-trip," Unusual exploitation, but exploitation just the same."
m/1022172-twelve_oclock_high," In addition to the fine acting, Twelve O'Clock High features some gorgeous camerawork by Leon Shamroy and one of the most horrifying aerial attack sequences ever put on film."
m/1022191-twins," The film feels, rather than the solid comedy it is, like a massive missed opportunity."
m/1022315-undefeated," While the action is decent, the plot is just a little too strained, the dialogue too wooden, and Hudson overmatched in this John Wayne vehicle."
m/1022369-unfaithfully_yours, One of the most sophisticated slapstick comedies ever made.
m/1022373-unforgiven," Considering how Huston and Lancaster have artistic disagreements over filming, it surprisingly still turned out relatively well."
m/1022473-valley_girl," It's an enjoyable flick, and it's often real funny."
m/1022537-venom," Kinski is his typical insane self, but this killer snake thriller lacks bite."
m/1022576-victory," The form of the film is conventional, but the manner in which it has been executed is not."
m/1022823-village_of_the_damned, Can still make contemporary audiences squirm in their seats.
m/1023205-warriors," a shameless, but entertaining, ode to the appeal of criminality and gangland camaraderie"
m/1023286-were_no_angels," I've rarely seen a location used more effectively than in We're No Angels, where the small town of Mission in British Columbia has been dressed up to match the Depression era."
m/1023316-weird_science," Le Brock plays her character with a sense of style and wit, something the rest of Weird Science largely lacks."
m/1023461-when_a_stranger_calls, Effective suburban legend suspenser that becomes unintentionally funny by the end
m/1023508-where_the_boys_are," It must have been some kind of alternate universe these movie people lived in, because it wasn't any sort of world I knew."
m/1023543-white_christmas, The whole thing is rather forced and antiseptically cheerful.
m/1023717-willard, Willard has some terrifying moments but it never comes up to being a'Psycho with rats that it sometimes aspires to. In between the horror scenes matters develop with little suspense or even mood.
m/1023739-winchester_73," At one time, the phrase 'action director' didn't mean a technician who knew how to stage the biggest explosions. It meant someone who understood the psychology of action, the reasons behind it."
m/1023854-witness," It's pretty to look at and it contains a number of good performances, but there is something exhausting about its neat balancing of opposing manners and values."
m/1023906-women," Cukor's direction is rich and confident, and the whole production fairly shimmers."
m/1024191-wrong_man, Hitchcock's shadowy mise-en-scne is given a greater sense of veracity through his use of actual NYC locations.
m/1024237-yearling," Along with Lassie Come Home, this is one of MGM's classic family-animal melodramas, based on Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' novel, beautifully acted by Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman Jr.(in his debut), with strong production values (in color)."
m/1024407-yours_mine_and_ours," A leering, uncertain, embarrassing, protracted little comedy-neatly divided into television inter-commercial periods, each terminated by an abysmal, inevitable joke-quite anti sex and pro compulsive procreation."
m/1028554-blue_steel," A mean and unsavory celebration of misplaced misogyny milked for dollars, a mindless soup of urban neurosis and sexual loathing."
m/1028561-where_the_heart_is, Well intentioned but failed attempt at morality story about homelessness
m/1028564-guardian," Of the many threats to modern man documented in horror films -- the slashers, the haunters, the body snatchers -- the most innocent would seem to be the druids."
m/1028711-mystery_train, An experimental film that went 'pulp' before 'fiction.'
m/1028715-revolution, Even the characters in the movie don't know what's going on.
m/1029042-henry_v," In this alert, rousing interpretation of Henry V, Branagh beats down the doors of high art and drags the sleeping bard into the light of modern day."
m/1029072-kiss_of_death, Hathaway's film noir is largely known for Richard Widmark's debut in an Oscar-nominated role of a giggling psycho who pushes old crippled ladies down the stairs.
m/1029112-alice_in_wonderland," It might not come close to a 5-star Disney Classic, but the breezy animation and colorful characters salvage an annoyingly fractured narrative."
m/1029314-dick_tracy," For all its superficial pleasures, Dick Tracy ultimately flounders because it provides an audience with nothing to take home and dream about."
m/1029408-bombshell," Surprising for something so mean-spirited to have come so early in the Dream Factory's saga of self-loathing, and even more surprising because it seems so heartfelt."
m/1029427-navy_seals, The film where we began to suspect that Charlie Sheen might not be as cool as we thought.
m/102_dalmatians, The sequel adds more insults and injuries that could traumatize little ones.
m/1030142-champ, What could've come across as schmaltz hums with the belief that what we're seeing is somehow sacred and true.
m/1031086-ghost," With a premise this stupid, it's hard to believe that Ghost became not just a mega-blockbuster but -- and you may have forgotten this -- the winner of two Oscars."
m/1031087-memphis_belle, Unashamedly commercial. Its moral fabric is thinner than that of other David Puttnam productions.
m/1031274-faust, Here is a picture which is as far removed from the ordinary movie as a Tintoretto painting.
m/1031278-gun_crazy," As film noir this hard-boiled story is much superior to the more popular and more critically acclaimed ""Bonnie and Clyde."""
m/1031385-jungle_book," The Jungle Book is fun, cheerful animation; high on hummable songs and comedy; and low on scary moments."
m/1031440-long_goodbye, It may not be exactly like the novel but then this Philip Marlowe is nothing like anything ever seen before.
m/1031458-houdini," Accuracy, be darned; this is pure entertainment bio-pic with Tony Curtis at the height of his charismatic matinee idol period; + working with wife Janet Leigh isn't bad either."
m/1031472-avalon, Levinson ends his Baltimore Trilogy in very fine form.
m/1031635-rookie, The one in which Clint Eastwood gets raped... [Blu-ray]
m/1031744-long_walk_home, Drama set in Alabama during the 1955 bus boycott proclaiming that racial equality cannot be eased into effortlessly; it requires the rigors of change and commitment.
m/1031763-anastasia, Still fascinating speculation/drama with compelling Bergman and Brynner in title roles.
m/1031766-jane_eyre," A well-constructed piece of studio work, with vivid black-and-white cinematography under matte painting skies that creates a turbulent, oppressive mood."
m/1031984-pit_and_the_pendulum," The second in the popular series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations made by the enterprising mini-studio American International Pictures, this Roger Corman picture is carpeted wall-to-wall with luxuriant gothic excess."
m/1032176-goodfellas, This cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s.
m/1032180-after_hours, a comedy that's both uproariously funny (often in a most uncomfortable way) and deeply disturbing at the same time.
m/1032182-white_fang," Though slow and overlong, the movie is at least scenic family fare."
m/1032409-boy_meets_girl," [VIDEO ESSAY] ""Boy Meets Girl"" is a passionate cinematic work that echoes the brilliant dramatic effects Leos Carax has achieved with his other films (""The Night is Young,"" ""The Lovers on the Bridge,"" ""Pola X,"" and ""Holy Motors"")."
m/1032518-mata_hari, This is the role that the Swedish beauty Greta Garbo is best known for.
m/1032750-hidden_agenda," The film is a bit slow and at times slightly strained, and there are moments when you'll be hard-pressed to understand all the dialogue -- but on the whole it is effective and chilling."
m/1032798-entertainer, One of Olivier's best roles; overall production A+.
m/1032814-sorry_wrong_number," The European migr director, Anton Litvak, shoots Stanwyck's bedroom as if it were a luxury prison."
m/1032970-awakenings, Solid medical drama. Williams is terrific in a straight role.
m/1032980-diabolique," A scary movie in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, and while it isn't as well known, it's just as chilling."
m/1033465-true_colors, A case study of the dire effects of an individual's lack of ethical standards.
m/1034067-switch," Switch has an intriguing premise and a terrific performance by Barkin, But it fails to really deliver on its promise."
m/1035061-fury," The film's message is resonant far beyond the moment of its creation, speaking even to our modern-day political reality."
m/1036052-come_and_see, Almost too chilling....it haunts beyond the point of entertainment.
m/1036129-miracle, The Miracle has so much poetic-nattering-by-the-Irish-seaside that the movie keeps drifting into the stratosphere. Jordan should come back down to earth. He does much better there.
m/1036179-hot_shots," ...flags in the middle, some of its gags trying to reach too far for a laugh, but an adequate amount of it is good enough to make up for the rest."
m/1036458-dogfight," Savoca's second film also deals with sexual politics, centering on a type of woman seldom seen in American movies"
m/1036553-hitman," The Hitman is Norris's attempt to do something darker, something riskier than he usually does."
m/1036976-romeo_and_juliet," The stars are too old, but it's a handsome film with a great John Barrymore performance."
m/1037015-doctor," Gives a fresh appreciation of the dynamic interplay between mind, body, and soul in the art of healing."
m/1037024-commitments, The real stars of this film are the music (big surprise) and the hard- edged working-class (and lower) settings in northern Dublin.
m/1037161-frankie_and_johnny, But even this dose of healthy cynicism cannot stay the movie's case of incurable romanticism.
m/1037177-deceived, Another concocted harried-heroine-strikes-back psychological thriller that comes spilling off the conveyor belt of conventional creativity. The only one who'll be Deceived is the giddy audience
m/1037244-star, The Star is a wonderful tour de force for Bette Davis.
m/1037447-poison," What's truly revolutionary about this filmmaker -- his perverse, ironic humanity -- is only intermittently on display in this quasi-provocative formalist knickknack"
m/1037581-cape_fear," Impressive moviemaking, showing Scorsese as a master of a traditional Hollywood genre who is able to mold it to his own themes and obsessions."
m/1037649-my_girl," Dreadful coming of age movie about kids and death. Kudos for the effort, but it's just depressing."
m/1037756-jfk, This is a fine movie from a technical and an acting viewpoint. The problem is that it is all balderdash.
m/1037780-man_in_the_moon," This cast is a knock-out. As the parents, veterans Sam Waterston, Tess Harper and Gail Strickland lead these novice teen actors in setting standards that these young performers will spend the rest of their careers trying to emulate."
m/1037789-train, Classic Frankenheimer WWII actioner with unique plot.
m/1037864-father_of_the_bride," Director Charles Shyer and his co-writing/producing partner Nancy Meyers have managed to bring the story of the 1950 film into the '90s, remain faithful to the source material and still make an up-to-date, warm comedy."
m/1038009-rush," It peaks way before the movie's over. You're caught in a slow but steady decline, an unwanted comedown."
m/1038176-medicine_man, One of the weakest 'Indiana Jones' rip-offs to date.
m/1038237-platinum_blonde," Still, with all its usual Capra faults, it holds up as a slightly above average breezy newspaper comedy."
m/1038526-uninvited, Brilliant! One of the greatest of all ghost stories.
m/1038613-italian_job," British criminals abroad - invading foreign turf, so to speak"
m/1038726-beethoven," A waggish tale of canine chicanery, an uproarious if impawsible symphony of drool, doggy fidelity and chewed shoes."
m/1038770-high_heels," Trying to combine drama and comedy in one movie often results in a bittersweet compromise. But in High Heels, Spanish director Pedro Almodovar mixes farce and passion in a way that heightens both extremes."
m/1038978-babe," Everything's played so big, there's no room for singles, small details that show touching moments. In Babe, everything's got to be a homer or nothing."
m/1038990-cutting_edge," Innocuous and energetic, but woefully predictable and occasionally silly."
m/1039132-kid_galahad, The popular film became a boxing classic for the 1930s.
m/1039270-deep_cover," Deep Cover was probably conceived as a quickie crime film, but thanks to Fishburne's and Goldblum's performances, it became much more."
m/1039460-all_i_want_for_christmas," This 1991 feature is not for diabetics or connoisseurs of real people, but everyone else should have a ball."
m/1039511-class_act, Kid & Play made two half-decent movies. This is one of 'em.
m/1039515-edward_ii, A highly styized screen version of Christopher Marlowe's 14th century drama
m/1039575-1039575-midnight_clear, Delves into the strain of war on the human spirit and our dependency upon community in the face of senseless death.
m/1039796-boomerang," A witless, sexist, offensive mishmash that is surprisingly inept, considering all the high-power talent involved."
m/1040198-rapid_fire," Rapid Fire is full of mindless, cynical action, elaborately choreographed fight scenes and spontaneous and perpetual mayhem."
m/1040322-of_mice_and_men," Although set in the Depression, it has relevance to all those today whose dreams of a better life have been shattered by unemployment, low wages, and fears of a worse future."
m/1040324-body_parts," I enjoyed what Red does with the material, but the potential is there for a far more stark and disturbing film. Someone remake this one."
m/1040378-cool_world," Here's hoping cartoons and noir will meet again on another, more auspicious, day."
m/1040379-singles, The movie will challenge some audiences simply because it is not a 1-2-3 progression of character and plot.
m/1040398-naked_city, This superlative film set the pattern for myriad documentary-type dramas to come.
m/1040678-last_of_the_mohicans," Mann wasn't thinking story, he was thinking scheme. Keep the eyes and ears dazzled, he reasons, and the substance will follow."
m/1040798-husbands_and_wives," What Husbands and Wives argues is that many ""rational"" relationships are actually not as durable as they seem, because somewhere inside every person is a child crying me! me! me!"
m/1041055-ned_kelly, This film is worth seeing for those who want to see what Mick Jagger looks like when sporting an Abe Lincoln beard.
m/1041070-hallelujah," The inventive director King Vidor reeceived a well-deserved Oscar nomination for making MGM's first all-black feature, shot on locations and later dubbed for sound."
m/1041862-forever_young," ""Forever Young,"" which turns on contrivances of plot rather than aspects of character, is as cheap emotionally as it is ideologically."
m/1041870-matinee, An affectionate look back at old-school matinee moviegoing.
m/1041911-unforgiven," Along with Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller, as authentic a depiction of a Wild West town as you are likely to find."
m/1042059-leap_of_faith," It's half a good film, only lacking the courage of its cynicism."
m/1042135-malcolm_x," Though at times it borders on the hagiographic, Malcolm X is remarkably faithful to the essence of the man -- his anger, his sly wit, his perpetual growth."
m/1042161-love_on_the_run, Charming romantic comedy with the stars at their peak.
m/1042193-scent_of_a_woman," When all Pacino's demons are bared, they don't add up to the poignant punchline you were set up for."
m/1042212-nowhere_to_run," All in all, it is a pretty good action film and it could be a breakthrough for Van Damme."
m/1042281-sniper," Sniper expresses a cool competence that is a pleasure to watch. It isn't a particularly original film, but what it does, it does well."
m/1042295-vanishing, The American remake of The Vanishing adds nothing but a happy ending to the original.
m/1042416-crush, The Crush would be an entirely worthless and painfully familiar little thriller even without its creepy devotion to the sexiness of youth.
m/1042466-boiling_point," Promoted like an action movie, but there's one problem -- this movie has no action!"
m/1042491-indian_summer, This is a story more interested in tone and mood than in big plot points.
m/1042538-alive," An overlooked gem, made even more powerful by the fact that it is based on a factual incident."
m/1042629-point_of_no_return," An okay remake of the better LA FEMME NIKITA. Captures the spirit, but not the intensity."
m/1042728-brothers_keeper," A wonderfully touching film filled with tension, heartache and amazing twists."
m/1043331-born_yesterday, There's little (if anything) to recommend this movie.
m/1043378-stalker," Stalker, a somber futuristic fantasy from the Soviet Union, attempts to build an apocalyptic vision out of the most impoverished materials imaginable."
m/1043923-browning_version, Worth watching for Redgrave's powerfully detailed performance as the schoolmaster.
m/1043960-made_in_america," Has anyone else noticed the apparent subtext that black men are unstable and unreliable, and only a white man can be sensitive to a black woman's needs?"
m/1044214-cliffhanger," When Cliffhanger is doing its Vertigo thing, it is an incredibly effective thriller, with an opening scene that is so intense audience members will work up a sweat and strain their fingers gripping the armrests on their theater seats."
m/1044522-firm," ""The Firm"" is never boring (even at almost 2 hours and 40 minutes) but it never really sparkles either."
m/1044836-black_scorpion," This is a staid, low-budget, B-film sci-fi'er about giant scorpions that come out of a volcano in a remote part of Mexico ..."
m/1044925-lodger," The picture has a very, very excellent begining, a mediocre middle and a most deplorable ending. A minor fault is that its running time is about fifteen minutes too long."
m/1045171-equinox," Should not only satisfy Rudolph fans, but garner him some new ones."
m/1045328-gypsy," The question is, why remake - particularly for television? Apart from a clutch of great songs, the energy and ironic humour of this version more than match the original movie. And there is a post-feminist interpretation..."
m/1045518-secret_garden," Holland just perfectly captures a mood so dismally ugly or so cloyingly sweet that I, for one, felt like gagging. I admit what she did, she did well."
m/1045568-strictly_ballroom, The true weirdness of the movie comes when we begin to realize the director didn't make everything up; only real life could possibly have inspired a world this bizarre.
m/1045706-calendar_girl," [Priestley] tries hard, but the numskull script has him beat."
m/1045833-savage_messiah," Russell takes the mystique away from art, but supplies nothing much in its place."
m/1045992-much_ado_about_nothing, The good news is that the audience will have just as much fun as the players with this one.
m/1046035-airborne," Tries for a genuinely entertaining dramedy while pandering to the Extreme Sports crowds, everywhere."
m/1046038-gettysburg," While sincerity obviously can't guarantee quality, it's still a refreshing step up from the blatant commercialism of most West Coast media projects."
m/1046049-fatal_instinct, A collection of gags that vary much too wildly in terms of timing and wit.
m/1046060-high_noon, The film works remarkably well as a simple but powerful parable.
m/1046076-home_of_our_own," This situation, set in the 1950s, could be the set-up for a sitcom, or a retread of an old Disney family yarn. It ends up being a lot more, partly because Kathy Bates brings a solid, no-nonsense clarity to what could have been a marshmallow role."
m/1046129-fugitive," A juggernaut of exaggeration, momentum and thrills."
m/1046151-fearless," Formidable and unforgettable film about mystery, near-death experiences and redemptive love."
m/1046180-trauma," Once lawless, Argento's pictures feel inconsequential now. Light and aimless."
m/1046227-cool_runnings, The setting and characters were so unique that the film quickly overcame its shortcomings to become a very satisfying piece of movie entertainment.
m/1046655-skin_game, A rather stagy and creaky early talkie (1931) by Alfred Hitchcock.
m/1046723-man_who_loved_women, Here is a sad movie with a funny movie inside trying to get out.
m/1046724-impact," It's a clever B-movie that doesn't quite make it as an A-feature, but has a good deal more class and style than most of its kind."
m/1046771-into_the_west," Although it may not offer sufficient action and bratty humor for a contemporary tyke, this warm and moving story of two young brothers and a magical white horse will satisfy the same sort of parent-child combinations as The Secret Garden."
m/1046772-three_musketeers," Very mildly entertaining. Not even worth watching a second time, but it worked as a Saturday matinee."
m/1046873-alice_in_wonderland," . Her crazy adventure teaches Alice about change, the multiple uses of words, curiosity, nonsense, and the great mysteries of life"
m/1047550-scared_stiff," Strictly for Martin & Lewis fans - another way of saying ""not for me, thanks"" - this latest of the zany partners' adventures takes them to a haunted island near Cuba."
m/1047928-gunmen," Truly awful, though I'll never get tired of Patrick Stewart a'slummin'."
m/1047940-dangerous_game, This twisted little trainwreck is amazing for the fact that it was ever even made.
m/1047985-getaway," Well-paced at the start, approaching commonplace heist scenarios with just enough uncertainty and freshness to create tension-filled unpredictability."
m/1048333-heaven_and_earth," Heaven and Earth has the epic scope one would expect from a film of this magnitude, but it lacks much of the narrative strength of Stone's first two Vietnamese tales."
m/1048445-snow_white_and_the_seven_dwarfs," So perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness."
m/1048585-sugar_hill," _As a message movie, ""Sugar Hill"" is perhaps no better or worse than most. It can be credited for striving to be more, but striving is not the same thing as being. Snipes deserves a better vehicle than this, but then, one suspects he picked it off the sho"
m/1048880-thumbelina," Under the authorship of Barry Manilow, it is not that the 'Thumbelina's' songs are abhorrent, is that, being presented every ten minutes in an hour and a half movie, they end up exhausting the viewer to unbearable limits. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/1049512-young_americans," Longo e sem foco, o filme procura conferir maior dimenso aos protagonistas atravs de subtramas dispensveis envolvendo suas parceiras."
m/1049883-alice," Not necessarily for young kids, this is a surrealist version with a great deal of attention accorded to objects."
m/1050388-last_man_on_earth," Flawed, but nicely grim sci-fi horror with a miscast Price"
m/1050454-1050454-shermans_march, McElwee asks us to reconnect not only with each other but with our human spirit.
m/1051219-bad_girls, It's hard to maintain the proper mood when your 'bad-***' heroines inspire fits of giggles.
m/1052529-black_beauty, It plays like a cross between New Age mysticism and anthropomorphism run amok.
m/1052608-circus, It's a beautiful film and perhaps more personal that anyone might have suspected at the time.
m/1052609-kid," Combinando com perfeio toques comoventes e engraados, o filme apresenta ao mundo um dos poucos atores que, ao lado de Chaplin, no empalideceram: o garotinho Jackie Coogan."
m/1052698-wyatt_earp," Beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore."
m/1052818-betty," Intriguing and potently administered, there are bounteous compelling elements both in and outside Betty's frames, and should have more of a renowned reputation than it does from Chabrol's later period."
m/1052838-blown_away, The stunts and bomb-diffusing excitement (including an earth-shattering fulmination toward the finale) generally outweigh the contrivances and editing problems.
m/1053779-mask," Even without the state-of-the-art, boundary-busting computerized effects from Industrial Light & Magic, Carrey's a human cartoon, and his spontaneous, Avery-esque, anything-for-a-laugh outrageousness makes this otherwise blank Mask a must-see."
m/1053942-wolf, Monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience; this one fails utterly in that arena.
m/1054125-shadow," The movie, from start to finish, is just an exercise in style."
m/1054344-it_could_happen_to_you," A steady stream of laughs and terrific chemistry between Cage and Fonda, bolstering both the comedy and the ultimate romance."
m/1054796-robin_hood," Fairbanks is the most exuberantly athletic of Robin Hoods, for sheer physicality perhaps outdoing even Errol Flynn's definitive performance. Fairbanks's third swashbuckler in some ways the ideal Fairbanks vehicle."
m/1055255-milk_money," A preposterous movie about a boy, a babe and a car, all of them functioning minimally in what is essentially a showcase for Melanie Griffith's body."
m/1055365-barcelona," It appears at first to be about the casual lives of young men trying to launch their careers, but eventually ... it reveals darker depths and meanings."
m/1055873-browning_version, High-class film about a middle-age teacher who does painful soul-searching.
m/1055875-only_you," It is total fantasy, light as a feather, contrary to all notions of common sense... and it takes place mostly in Venice, Rome, and the glorious Italian hillside town of Positano. What more do you want?"
m/1056079-specialist," With all the preening, posing and stretching, it's hard to know if The Specialist is an action movie or an exercise video."
m/1057370-beloved," While watching Beloved, I could easily see one of the best films of the year within, but it ultimately let me down in its penultimate moments."
m/1057637-jungle_book," The narrative shifts from romance to adventure the way Cheetah used to hop from foot to foot, but Sommers nevertheless delivers a bully family picture."
m/1058156-life_and_times_of_allen_ginsberg," Comprehensive bio-pic of the Beat Generation poet best remembered for 'Howl' the epic poem which opens with the immortal line, 'I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness.' Cool, Daddy-O!"
m/1058426-junior," A histria  absurda, mas esta  uma daquelas comdias leves que servem como bom passatempo."
m/1058516-street_fighter, ...the film has been infused with a myriad of shamelessly over-the-top elements that inevitably become quite tough to take.
m/1058517-little_women, Director Gillian Armstrong and writer Robin Swicord have fashioned an entrancing film from this distinctly unfashionable classic.
m/1058923-shallow_grave, Boyle's relentless homage to Hitchcock ... wears thin.
m/1058955-bad_company," The plot moves like clockwork, surprising us, then surprising us again, but I liked Bad Company more for its style, look and feel."
m/1058966-red," Visually and emotionally, this is the director's warmest film."
m/1059487-nobodys_fool," It's satisfying, but if you see the film, don't expect to have too much to say about it."
m/1059489-wild_bunch," A brilliant script, cinematography, editing, and performances complement the whole picture."
m/1059629-quick_and_the_dead," Perhaps another director could have gotten both tribute and parody to work together; in Raimi's hands, they instead cast doubt upon each other."
m/1059858-man_of_the_house, Pretty weak little family comedy...doesn't hurt but doesn't help.
m/1059867-born_to_be_wild, Screenwriters Paul Young and John Bunzel... can't decide whether they're making a slapstick comedy or an impassioned ecological statement or just a harmless baby-sitter...
m/1060518-hideaway, Brain-damaged adaptation of a book that wasn't all that brilliant to begin with.
m/1061171-old_dark_house, A marvellous horror film which still retains the same sense of creeping awe.
m/1061238-school_for_scoundrels," Despite a weak finish, this is an enjoyable British comedy starring the incomparable Alastair Sim."
m/1061401-village_of_the_damned, This film is devoid of any real tension or thrills.
m/1061812-little_princess," A Little Princess is a delightful film. Bring your children, or just bring yourself."
m/1062174-mad_love, Almost dreadful enough to spark reassessment of Brooke Shields in Endless Love.
m/1062483-bad_boys," Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end."
m/1062983-smoke," Puff away, and breathe in the smoke while it lasts."
m/1063452-pocahontas," Enjoyable, but doesn't measure up to Disney's recent standards."
m/1064013-contraband, It was strange to see Veidt in a romantic hero role.
m/1064015-raw_deal, Top notch noir flick directed by Anthony Mann with Dennis O'Keefe starring.
m/1065298-cowboy, A good hard-boiled western with much less than the usual frontier hokum.
m/1065598-babe," The world of Babe isn't a seamless one, but it's surely inviting and rewarding."
m/1065632-prophecy, Top-notch combination of Supernatural thrills and Walken-esque sensation
m/1065684-braveheart," I continue to enjoy watching and re-watching it, and share much of Mel Gibson's enthusiasm for his project."
m/1065837-copycat, Chilling serial killer thriller. You will never look at Harry Connick Jr the same way again.
m/1065868-fair_game," Cindy Crawford is the best thing, and ultimately the worst thing, about this pitiful action thriller."
m/1066120-scarlet_letter," This catastrophic conglomeration of Puritanical repression and modern sensibilities squanders terrific acting talent and sumptuous production values, not to mention a darn good story."
m/1066169-home_for_the_holidays," Overstuffed with subplots, the film is somewhat episodic in nature, giving each of the characters a few scenes to develop some depth. But their eccentricities seem overly mannered and the big gag scenes are not played strictly for laughs."
m/1066170-kicking_and_screaming, Kicking And Screaming's familiarity breeds a caustic but definitive contentment that comes with uncloaking the popular twentysomething trend toward guy-bright-but-lite.
m/1066229-shadows," Even decades later, it has a spark of exciting newness about it."
m/1066528-persuasion," Apart from some minor audio problems, Persuasion is a truly enjoyable film that captures the time period in an amusing, revealing manner and is educational for all ages."
m/1066712-to_die_for," Half snappy, sardonic and incisive and half slow-moving, goofy and dense."
m/1067137-it_takes_two, A rote variation on Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper that is marginally salvaged by those spunky Olsen twins from ABC's Full House.
m/1067234-boomerang," Elia Kazan, as an afterthought, comments he wished he played up the corruption part of the story in more detail."
m/1067987-casino," Whether you find it exhilarating, expendable or exhausting -- and you will find it exhausting -- Martin Scorsese's Casino is the spectacular last word on urban sprawl."
m/1068044-jumanji, All the effects in the world can't disguise the thin plot.
m/1068177-richard_iii," A fantastic flick, filled with welcome life, and hysterically darkly comic humor."
m/1068182-heat, Boosters and touts use the term 'major movie' so often that it's more likely to generate yawns than excitement at this point. Back to basics. Heat is a major movie. With major stars. Doing major acting.
m/1068307-addiction, The Addiction is less a blood-sucking story than a fable about modern enervation.
m/1068326-sabrina, Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond have great chemistry.
m/1068461-heavy_metal," Regardless of its dated stylishness (which still holds up remarkably well a decade + later), Heavy Metal was a pioneering film in 1981 and remains a pivitol and infuential body of art today."
m/1068468-hill, Uncompromising look at the inside of a British military prison in North Africa during WW II.
m/1068470-sudden_death," Although this is an uninspired re-working of the Die Hard formula, it is probably O.K. as mindless holiday entertainment."
m/1068779-dead_man_walking," Dead Man Walking is a provocative, well-made film on a surprisingly intelligent level."
m/1068783-georgia," A painful though sadly humorous portrait of sisterhood deftly written by Leigh's mom, Barbara Turner, and directed with just-right spareness by Ula Grosbard."
m/1068960-wuthering_heights," Wuthering Heights is a competent, tasteful, frequently even lovely re-adaption of Emily Bronte's Gothic, mystical love story. But the brooding tension, the electric passion of two lovers compelled to an inevitable tragedy is not generated."
m/1069241-broken_arrow," Directed with the keen action instincts Woo brought to The Killer, Hard-Boiled and other cult causes from his career in Hong Kong."
m/1069339-restoration," Even in period drag, this movie resembles warmed-over Forrest Gump."
m/1069419-black_sheep," Black Sheep is an appropriately titled misfire, a des-perate slapstick comedy that falls flat at nearly every turn."
m/1069696-screamers," A pile of recycled space junk, it alienates even while flinging body parts into the audience's yawning faces."
m/1069707-othello," It almost works. Except when Shakespeare, Parker or the actors get in the way."
m/1069981-substitute, Settles for being a deranged version of The A-Team meets The Principal.
m/1069985-diabolique," Film lovers should study the two Diaboliques side by side, in order to see how the Hollywood assembly line trashed its treasure from the past."
m/1070061-before_and_after, A strained but nevertheless involving little personal drama about a delinquent's alleged murderous deed. Schroeder's suspense piece is arbitrary but satisfying thanks to the reliable leads.
m/1070604-carried_away," Everyone in the film -- even the teenager -- is more intelligent and articulate than is usually permitted in American movies, and having gotten themselves into an emotional tangle, they go to work getting themselves out again."
m/1070608-quest, The endeavor looks less like a movie than some ESPN programmer's worst brainstorm.
m/1070992-primal_fear," As a forum for its actors and for the big-screen directorial debut of multi-Emmy winner Gregory Hoblit, the film is up to the job."
m/1071167-twister," The story is pretty thin, but the gee-whiz effects -- especially in an auditorium with good stereo sound -- are guaranteed to knock the audience for a loop."
m/1071258-fear," A throwback to the psycho-sexual thrillers of the 1980s, Fear is sort of a male version of Fatal Attraction"
m/1071267-arrival, ...it ultimately seems apparent that the movie would've been well-served had it topped out at 90 minutes (ie it's too long and feels it).
m/1071404-jane_eyre, Convincing and mesmerizing interpretation of this literary classic by Charlotte Bronte.
m/1071413-last_dance, Too many of its scenes are based on conventional ideas of story construction. We can see the bones beneath the skin.
m/1071414-moll_flanders," For a story about a London harlot's trials and tribulations, this is one unsexy, drawn-out dirge with only a few smirking moments as relief."
m/1071464-last_supper," The problem with movies like The Last Supper, about 20-somethings with lots to talk about and nothing to do, is they try to cut a wide creative swath through biting satire, poignant darkness, and aesthetics and come up far short on all counts."
m/1071769-cold_comfort_farm," The movie, based on the famous comic novel by Stella Gibbons, is dour, eccentric and very funny, and depends on the British gift for treating madness as good common sense."
m/1071806-independence_day," Independence Day backs up the commonly-heard claim that movie success often has little to do with a good story and compelling characters and everything to do with big stars, big production values and good timing."
m/1072011-rock," Despite ample gunfights, chases and explosions, the tension in The Rock never translates into excitement for the audience."
m/1072083-phantom, A spiritless affair likely to vanish quickly from first-run screens.
m/1072107-matilda," With her sweet-sad face, Mara Wilson is a perfect Matilda."
m/1072156-island_of_dr_moreau," The most exciting characters are killed off too early, and what we're left with is a Satan's ""Seasme Street."""
m/1072326-struggle," One of his most powerful and intensely felt works -- not merely a heartbreaking story and a portrait of the Depression at its grimmest, but a poignant summary of everything that Griffith could do with a camera."
m/1072381-time_to_kill," The performances are strong, the issues provocative. I was glad I saw it, but I was also glad when it was over; my chest was sore from Schumacher aiming wallops at my heart. Sometimes he connected, but I wished he'd aimed more often at my brain."
m/1072385-kingpin," Funny, outrageous, vulgar. The only bowling comedy in memory."
m/1072457-chain_reaction, Exhilarating but skin-deep summer fun. (You were expecting Shakespeare?)
m/1072683-infinity, Unconventional love story about a scientist and his responses to adversity and death.
m/1072833-alaska," Really bad performances, an awful script straight out of a TV movie of the week and one of the least appealing, most irritating young heroes in recent screen history"
m/1072875-jack, Coppola was obviously having an off day with this manipulative and meaningless dribble of a dramedy. Robin Williams should consider omitting Jack from his film resume'.
m/1072957-freeway," It's too drawn-out, too talky and, at the most crucial moment, needlessly implausible, to sustain its humor and large dose of violence."
m/1072971-girls_town," Holds appeal, partly because it could so easily have been an uplifting message movie but it refuses to be so simplistic."
m/1072972-fan, Mesmerizing film about the soul-killing dimensions of perfectionism.
m/1072990-harriet_the_spy," ...in busily updating the '60s story for the more worldly '90s, the filmmakers have ended up, ironically, with a product much more naively juvenile than the original."
m/1073023-house_arrest," As sitcoms go, House Arrest, opening today, is more sit than com."
m/1073037-hunchback_of_notre_dame, This is pretty sophisticated for so-called kid stuff.
m/1073161-bulletproof," The audience is subjected to an onslaught of unfunny jokes, a string of useless profanity, and more explosive squibs than Caan wore in The Godfather."
m/1073285-foxfire, Joyce Carol Oates and her fans will be disappointed by this trivial and muddled screen version of her popular novel about female bonding and empowerment.
m/1073316-emma, Emma proves that cinema is up to the greatest that literature has to offer.
m/1073427-selena," Without a compelling narrative direction, Selena becomes a polished and respectful feature film version of an A&E ""Biography."""
m/1074022-lone_star," A capacious drama about political, racial, and familial tensions and the changes sparked by memories in a southwest border community."
m/1074108-101_dalmatians, Close's Cruella matches her animated counterpart's nastiness and then some; her hilariously over-the-top turn is sure to influence drag queens everywhere.
m/1074298-ransom," On top of its ugly class politics, the film delivers only cheap, formulaic thrills."
m/1074316-scream," While Scream has its frights, it feels more like one of those solve-the -mystery jigsaw puzzles than a real movie."
m/1074374-one_fine_day," The formula remains evergreen -- two attractive leads are thrown together by quirk; develop antipathies, even loathing; then, ultimately decide they have overreacted and are hopelessly in love."
m/1074465-michael, John Travolta's Ever-Sap - Coming Soon to a Supermarket Near You
m/1074467-in_love_and_war," Before you can say 'gangrene,' the two fall for each other, but everyone knows that historical romances released in December are never destined to end happily."
m/1074505-touch," Although not destined for greatness, there are some appealing elements about this irreverent comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously; bizarre characters, off-the-wall concepts and absurdly funny lines."
m/1074675-1074675-metro," Despite Murphy's consistently strong performance, Metro meanders into a rather unremarkable cat-and-mouse territory."
m/1074978-crucible," This version illuminates the story's numerous strengths, resulting in a motion picture of surprising emotional and intellectual impact."
m/1075422-hamlet," Standing apart from virtually all other movie fare this season, Hamlet makes for a fertile promontory."
m/1075777-private_parts, This oft-riotous bio is the ultimate loser-makes-good fantasy.
m/1075959-mother," For people who believe that a grown-up son can never go home again, Brook's serio comedy, one of the few Hollywood pictures dealing with mother-son relationship in a poignant way, came as a surprise; Debbie Reynolds in a comeback turn is great."
m/1075984-iron_monkey," Iron Monkey embraces its Shaolin roots, complete with fighters who announce their special moves (""Shaolin Golden Palm!"", ""Shadowless Kick!"", ""Flying Sleeves!"" etc.)."
m/1076097-mchales_navy," A lot like its star, Tom Arnold -- big and bombastic, with no substance."
m/1076267-volcano," The visuals are colorful, but the script is just terrible."
m/1076620-anna_karenina," This sleek, Cliffs Notes version of a masterpiece is ... glossy and picture perfect on the surface and hollow at the core."
m/1076721-get_carter," Caine is the heart of the matter -- cool, calculating. professional with sudden explosions of action and violence. Now that he has resumed his stride he ought to find some better material."
m/1076723-traveller, Interesting slice-of-life about a deliberately little-known pocket of American culture.
m/1077027-batman_and_robin, This is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director Joel Schumacher. It's also the fourth worst in the series (and second worst from Joel).
m/1077062-van, This third movie from novelist Roddy Doyle's Barrytown Trilogy is as good-natured as The Commitments and The Snapper but far less consistent.
m/1077077-breakdown, A terrifying movie that presses the right buttons early on and then capitalizes on your vulnerability.
m/1077332-pippi_longstocking," Not even watchable. This freakish film defines ""lowbrow."""
m/1077642-nothing_to_lose, A bumpy buddy romp that's mildly winning thanks to its stars.
m/1077847-george_of_the_jungle," Depending on your point of view, this film is either truly awful or so bad it is good. In either case, be warned that a little of this repetitive movie can go a long way."
m/1078021-contact," Carl Sagan's ode to the superior intelligence of aliens (and how us darned humans mess everything up) is consistently beautiful and interesting, but it never makes a point (except for that bit about the darned humans)."
m/1078022-buddy," Stifled by quaint Masterpiece Theatre-for-tykes pretensions, Buddy only comes alive when its quartet of real-life chimps go ape."
m/1078030-hoodlum," A collection of elements rather than a distinct story, the film takes what should have been a fresh perspective on the genre and paints by numbers."
m/1078035-steel, Slow to gather momentum and generates little excitement or tension.
m/1078038-fire_down_below, A by-the-numbers actioner that hits most of its marks.
m/1078165-bliss, Writer/director Lance Young is so relentlessly solemn ... that some viewers may giggle.
m/1078216-picture_perfect," Insubstantial and oversweet, it still refreshes as a midsummer brain cooler."
m/1078942-shall_we_dance, This leisurely little import has its moments - but far too many of them. It runs two hours and seems to end five times.
m/1078955-game," If...you find yourself thinking of simple solutions to hero's dilemma every five minutes, that's a pretty lame thriller. In The Game, it's more like every two minutes."
m/1079025-most_wanted, [T]he film isn't as terrible as you might think - it's just bad.
m/1079452-assignment, Quinn gives a commanding performance as both Ramirez and Carlos.
m/1079516-peacemaker," A solid, muscular thriller that manages to deliver big action set-pieces without insulting the audience's intelligence."
m/1079716-seven_years_in_tibet," One of the season's more substantial large-scale entertainments, using colorful storytelling and Pitt's appealing presence to spotlight an imperialistic event that continues to cry for correction."
m/1079718-one_night_stand," The result is peculiar: I liked almost everything about the film except for the central relationship, which struck me as just an excuse for everything else."
m/1079818-anastasia," Anastasia is a mixed bag, but viewers ought to hope it succeeds: Disney could use the competition."
m/1079908-12_angry_men, A very disappointing version of the classic stage play...
m/1080177-firestorm," Put it this way: Long is Olivier compared to the last ex-pro football player to try his hand at the silver screen, Brian Bosworth."
m/1080205-killers, The cast is excellent and Siodmak's direction is hard-edged and moody.
m/1080867-rainmaker," While the film retains some pleasures, Coppola's heavy-handed direction snuffs out the sense of exhilaration a story like this should have."
m/1080990-fallen," Fallen will sell tickets on the strength of its appealing cast and high-impact camera work, but will probably fade from the scene more quickly than its demonic villain does in the story."
m/1081000-fall," Fall often feels like a remake of 9 1/2 Weeks, with Schaeffer seemingly competing with Mickey Rourke for most..disgusting sleazeball ever committed to celluloid."
m/1081200-great_expectations," It's a fairly minor film, but quite lovely and successful at creating its own time and place."
m/1082400-man_in_the_iron_mask," Once all the pieces of the plot were in place, I was at least interested, if not overwhelmed; I could see how, with a rewrite and a better focus, this could have been a film of Braveheart quality instead of basically just a costume swashbuckler."
m/1082420-mr_nice_guy," As with Jackie Chan's other stateside releases, this is contrived, blockheaded, and lacking in narrative logic. But also like those other films, it is a highly enjoyable ride."
m/1082432-wide_awake," I was aware of the problems, but that didn't diminish the warm, fuzzy glow I was experiencing."
m/1082542-imitation_of_life," The movie looks incredible, especially considering it was made in 1934, and its sophisticated story is modern enough to be equally powerful today."
m/1082855-twilight," Writer-director Robert Benton obviously intended to paint this neo-noir in somber tones, but he's succeeded beyond what's good for his movie."
m/1082899-hush," This film is so bad, even good actors can't save it."
m/1082980-passion, An intriguing movie by Jean-Luc Godard about love and work
m/1083121-of_mice_and_men," The natural state of humanity is to be kind to each other, Steinbeck says - holding George and Lennie up as an imperfect example."
m/1083171-perfect_murder, ...there's nothing about this thriller to prevent it from soon becoming enmeshed in the memory with others in which Michael Douglas wears a starched collar and grits his teeth.
m/1083326-les_miserables," Towering over the entire film is Liam Neeson, the Irish actor who seems at home in any kind of picture, whether it transpires in contemporary America, World War II Germany, or centuries-ago Scotland."
m/1083410-madeline," Clever production and costume design reflect the simplicity of Bemelmans' drawings, and keep the audience firmly in touch with the author's whimsical sensibilities."
m/1083414-parent_trap, Movies like this remember how much fun escapism can be.
m/1083436-1083436-out_of_sight," Complementing films from Bonnie and Clyde to Pulp Fiction, Out of Sight delivers original material in a stylish manner."
m/1083461-avengers," You may think you're ready for the possibility that a film could be bad, but little can prepare you for something as pointless, smug and misguided as The Avengers."
m/1083480-dirty_work," ...proves that a comedy doesn't need an R rating to be crude, rude, or stupid. Even an innocent PG-13 can do the trick."
m/1083481-negotiator, ...some of the best acting you're likely to see in any action movie.
m/1083484-blade, It's stylish and fast-paced. It's also a lot of fun.
m/1083535-mafia," Okay spoof comedy, but missing a lot of the charm of Zucker movies."
m/1083659-rounders," Damon, Norton are game, but Rounders script a letdown."
m/1083688-return_to_paradise, Return to Paradise isn't a bad film. It's just one that doesn't live up to its potential.
m/1083791-funny_games," Remarkably well-directed and played, the crisp images perfectly framed by cinematographer Jürgen Jürges for maximum effect."
m/1083934-soldier," With a cheerful disregard for characterization and visual texture, Anderson relies on his cgi-jocks and set dressers to flesh out David Webb Peoples's by-the-numbers script."
m/1083937-whatever," Skoog undermines the impact of her own film, but it still doesn't kill off the good performances by Weil and Morgan."
m/1084081-tango," A realistic, haunting fantasy with power and passion."
m/1084146-thin_red_line, The equal of Saving Private Ryan in creating devastatingly potent battle sequences. And it is its superior in cinematic poetry.
m/1084153-elizabeth," ""Elizabeth"" is history rendered with enough brains and imagination to more than make up for its fewstumbles."
m/1084175-happiness," Happiness is not a film about happiness, but what is imagined as making one happy."
m/1084229-cousin_bette," A revenge drama, with Lange's Bette pulling the strings."
m/1084398-life_is_beautiful, The movie's eventual transition from silly fun to heartstring-tugging tearjerker mode comes off as limp at best.
m/1084582-mighty_joe_young," Mighty Joe Young is an energetic, robust adventure tale: not too cynical, violent or fragmented for kids, not too tame for adults."
m/1084607-at_first_sight," A wintry, truth-based, Charlyesque tale of star-crossed lovers about the titular sense lost, regained, and then lost again, i.e., double-negative-nonsense."
m/1084878-supernova, Not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.
m/1084881-lolita," Lyne's update on this comic, bittersweet tale benefits mightily from a clever screenplay by Stephen Schiff and terrific performances by the movie's two leads."
m/1084928-true_crime," A respectable film, particularly in its unequivocal details involving the characters and genuinely unpredictable outcome."
m/1084964-psycho," Vaughn, from the outset, seems like a loose cannon, a nut case, a psycho. Unlike Anthony Perkins who, at first, appeared as a shy mama's boy, Vaughn adds an extra layer of menace to his Norman that renders Van Sant's film a bit a-kilter."
m/1085113-siege," In his misguided literalness, Zwick has shown us the face of a police state without exposing its core."
m/1085275-gloria," Unable to commit to being a thriller or a character study, the movie settles for being an excitement-free drag."
m/1085404-impostors," Tucci firms up an intelligent entertainment, giving us the lowdown on some highbrows who really aren't the sophisticates they appear."
m/1085867-virus, There isn't much about Virus that you won't know by guessing.
m/1086991-life, Murphy and Lawrence both give substance to roles as innocents sentenced to life in prison for a murder they didn't commit.
m/1087050-lost_and_found," Eventually, ""Lost and Found"" becomes a mellow, romance-lite, comedy with a few good zingers and the heart of a puppy-dog."
m/1087053-go, Three fast-paced black comedies for the price of one with each fascinating enough to stand on its own.
m/1087270-mummy," Tries to have it both ways, sending up the adventure genre for laughs while also going for some mild shocks, but the sand slips through its fingers on both counts."
m/1087341-winslow_boy, You might have to wait a long time before you find a film with both a family and a lawyer portrayed in such a genuine and likable way.
m/1087427-general, Large chunks of The General are completely incomprehensible.
m/1087648-payback, The thin story never generates any genuine excitement.
m/1087747-bent," Tired of gay rights movies and Holocaust flicks? This is both, but it still enthralls."
m/1087935-buena_vista_social_club, A joyous tribute to a group of humble but true artists.
m/1087999-friends_and_lovers," The gags and situations are but repetitions and variations on dull, ribaldly worn and reject elementary Farrelly Brothers scribing."
m/1088110-ill_be_home_for_christmas, The results are only slightly better than coal in your stocking.
m/1088763-underground, Offers a zany overview of the treacherous path of politics in Yugoslavia leading to the outbreak of civil war in 1992.
m/1089671-13th_floor, Most of the surprises in this intriguing premise are already being used by eXistenZ and The Matrix.
m/1089805-ogre," Schlndorff and Jean-Claude Carrire find in Michel Tournier's novel a companion piece to their earlier Gnter Grass adaptation, The Tin Drum."
m/1090089-jack_frost, The novelty of the snowman effects wears thin after a while.
m/1090492-war_at_home," As a chronicle of consciousness-raising resistance methods, ""The War at Home"" is illuminating."
m/1090759-deep_blue_sea, The script is so poor that any attempt to introduce a straw-man argument about medical ethics and animal testing is embarrassing.
m/1090787-after_sex, an unusual film about human sexual relations - both because it's told completely from the woman's perspective and because it shows graphically but always tastefully the heat of passion.
m/1090789-haunting," So breathtakingly bad, so unintentionally funny that it could take on the status of a camp classic."
m/1090805-dick, Makes particular aspects of the recent American past comprehensible to those too young to have lived them.
m/1090918-midsummer_nights_dream," In spite of the cast, this is a competent but unexceptional version of one of Shakespeare's more popular plays."
m/1091165-deja_vu," Foyt's characterization runs hot and cold, to the point where it's tough to tell if Dana is merely wrestling with a divided heart or struggling with undiagnosed manic depression."
m/1091577-ideal_husband," Leave it up to director Oliver Parker's An Ideal Husband, based loosely on famed 19th-century writer Oscar Wilde's play, to prove that all a period film needs to jump vibrantly to life is a remarkable cast."
m/1091981-fireworks, Kitano uses his own face as a blank slate with which to sketch a complicated human being.
m/1092437-in_too_deep," Deep was scripted from true police accounts, but it consistently fails to evoke any real sense of danger."
m/1093551-best_man," Lee's story, which rambles on for a good half-hour longer than is necessary, contains little we haven't already seen dozens of times at the movies."
m/1093579-man_on_the_moon, Carrey shines so much with the power of his performance that he almost blots everyone else out.
m/1093611-anna_and_the_king," At heart, this is no more or less than self-consciously old-fashioned entertainment."
m/1093614-double_jeopardy," Everyone who plunked down $9.50 to see it could have most likely, at that moment the money left their hands, turned on the USA network and found the exact same movie playing."
m/1093641-hurricane," Rubin Carter can't be the saint Jewison would have us believe, but only the very ungenerous will find grounds for complaint."
m/1093655-diamonds," Sadly, Kirk Douglas' real-life stroke is the most compelling ingredient in Miramax's new cobbled-together caper flick."
m/1093671-end_of_the_affair, The elegance of Roger Pratt's camera and the handsome costuming create a tension between the stately surface world and the raw passion of the characters.
m/1093738-guinevere, A film that might have survived with a little integrity drowns in its own silly soapsuds.
m/1093843-mansfield_park," This is perhaps not Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but Jane Austen would have probably recognized most of it and would have been amused by the rest."
m/1093854-miss_julie," That faint, whirring sound you hear may be Strindberg himself, spinning in his grave."
m/1093874-superstar," Superstar will rank closer to Wayne's World than It's Pat or Roxbury. In Saturday Night Live terms, that constitutes a masterpiece."
m/1093881-house_on_haunted_hill, The scariest images are lifted directly from Jacob's Ladder and Ghost Story.
m/1093901-tumbleweeds," A delicate drama, short on plot but rich in memorable characters."
m/1093976-bachelor, The Bachelor is just as dismal a failure -- the anti-date movie of the year.
m/1094041-last_night, It's no exaggeration when I say Last Night is one of 1998's best films.
m/1094164-dog_of_flanders," enough spirit and the right attitude, but the rest of the essential elements of a successful movie just are not here."
m/1094646-eye_of_the_beholder," I didn't get it at all, but I have a sneaking suspicion it's going to be a cult classic. It's that oblique."
m/1094723-celebration," Vinterberg, while successfully holding his viewer's attention and moving his tale along with dispatch, doesn't here justify the unpleasantness with fresh insight."
m/1095081-boiler_room," Writer-director Ben Younger experienced the sales pitch of a boiler room recruiter in real life. His fascination with the thrill-junkie life of these stock jocks is reflected in the script's sharp, arrogant dialogue."
m/1095351-1095351-what_planet_are_you_from," Garry Shandling drops his pants for his art in What Planet Are You From?, and it isn't a pretty sight."
m/1095414-whatever_it_takes," Besides being strictly perfunctory, the movie is marked by its offhand sense of cruelty."
m/1095420-high_fidelity, The movie is sparked by more than half a dozen incisive performances.
m/1096832-where_the_heart_is, Where the Heart Is is a soap-opera trash compactor.
m/1096844-committed, Graham finally delivers the star performance she's been promising for so long.
m/1097046-dinosaur, The animators have done a tremendous job of making the animals fit in each scene.
m/1097242-screwed, What sort of filmmakers could possibly think it a good idea to title their picture Screwed?
m/1097245-hamlet," One of this year's great films, a worthy addition in every way to the cinematic sub-genre that is Hamlet itself."
m/1097259-road_trip," Aims for the edgy humor of There's Something About Mary, but as directed and co-written by Todd Phillips, has neither the smarts nor the sass of the latter film."
m/1097859-sunshine, ... a visionary odyssey with a grace and awe and visual scope that calls to mind Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey for a new millennium...
m/1097865-gone_in_60_seconds," Gone in 60 Seconds plays like a picture made by the numbers, for the numbers."
m/1097991-george_washington, Green effectively creates his main characters and imbues the film with a powerful sense of place and mood.
m/1098038-shaft," We finally have a summer action film built on sharp dialogue, vivid characters and genuine adrenaline rushes."
m/1098149-patriot," A riveting, slick, graphically violent piece of entertainment."
m/1098652-in_crowd, There's no way I'll be able to explain all the cheesy goings-on in this one little note.
m/1098734-loser, The script is unevenly polished and slightly disjointed.
m/1099492-saving_grace," Ferguson and Blethyn worked hard to add some substance to the plot and characters, even while letting the surface seem shallow and easy."
m/1099604-art_of_war," If they ever open the Museum of Bad Movies, here's the only exhibit they'll ever need."
m/1099659-crew," In a summer filled with crappy gross-out comedies, The Crew is a pleasant and amusing alternative."
m/10_cent_pistol," ""10 Cent Pistol"" serves as a perfect example of getting what you pay for."
m/10_cloverfield_lane," With its patchwork story, sewn together from disparate plotlines (perhaps collated from discarded script ideas), 10 Cloverfield Lane can be trying on our patience when it should be tightening the tension screws."
m/10_minutes_gone, Almost every element of the film has been seemingly engineered to be the ne + ultra of slapdash ineptitude.
m/10_questions_for_the_dalai_lama," A nicely crafted, economic (it's only 85 minutes) introduction to that most eminent of men, the spiritual leader and deposed head of state of Tibet."
m/10_rules_for_sleeping_around, The movie doesn't work even as an instructional video.
m/10_things_i_hate_about_you," No one in this film is a big star, but everyone is a capable actor."
m/10_years," There's a relaxed, unforced, melancholy sweetness and swing to this modest iteration of the Big Chill/Return of the Secaucus 7 formula, a pleasing directorial debut for screenwriter Jamie Linden."
m/10th_and_wolf," A listless Godfather-meets-Donnie Brasco tale of undercover surveillance, blood allegiances, and wrenching betrayal."
m/10x10," By the time ""10x10"" starts coming to together, it's over, which is a strange way to build a thriller."
m/1100039-bait," The formula is certainly typical for an urban action flick, but Foxx freshens it with his humorous, ultimately ingratiating portrayal."
m/1100086-duets," To their credit, [Byrum and Paltrow] attempted to make a movie of ideas. Alas, many of the ideas are bad. Not to mention bigoted."
m/1100122-beautiful," The tame, confused script eventually sinks the film."
m/1100197-under_suspicion," Not even the high-caliber talents of Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman can save this stagy, ridiculously over-baked psychological thriller."
m/1100318-circus, Another Tarantino wannabe film that falls flat on its face artistically...
m/1100569-get_carter, Get Carter is a movie conceived around a handful of cool scenes.
m/1100820-attack," One of Robert Aldrich's best films, this dark, grim, cynical portrait of infantry warfare in 1944 Belgium is extremely well acted by Jack Palance, Lee Marvin, Eddie Albert and the rest of the male cast."
m/1100998-contender, A hard-hitting political film about character assassination.
m/1101029-ladies_man," Though he's worth a chuckle in a sketch, neither Leon nor Meadows is interesting enough to build a movie around."
m/1101034-lost_souls," Funny how in movies like this, everyone seems to wait until the last minute to take action against something that could easily be halted right from the beginning."
m/1101051-bedazzled," You'll be suitably amused, but it's a safe bet you won't be dazzled."
m/1101191-blow_dry," It's not a good hair day for Blow Dry, in which The Full Monty writer Simon Beaufoy tries to mesh melodrama and camp, but comes up with merely a fraction of the inspiration of his previous international hit."
m/1101255-kiss_before_dying," Oswald, who never graduated past B-movies and television, makes masterful use of the frame, pitting his dark thriller elements against a full-color, widescreen frame."
m/1101561-1101561-malena, Less of a story than it is an extended passage of visual fetishism and offensive sexist meandering.
m/1101601-lies, this is sex with all the passion of a geometry proof and all the awkwardness of a junior high school dance . . .
m/1103197-city, It gives faces to the faceless and is not easily forgotten.
m/1103231-gift," The makers of The Gift lay on the rustic nonsense awfully thick, peopling the tiny town of Brixton, Ga., with more 'colorful' characters than any town -- or movie -- can tolerate."
m/1103281-traffic," Drugs become a character, crafted with more complexity and nuance than the human characters in most films."
m/1104038-double_take, I had to do a double take on some of the plot holes.
m/1104203-pledge," The story falls into the trap of using too many twists, red herrings and coincidences."
m/1104207-panic," As a mood piece, Panic hits its mark with dark, haunting accuracy. Director Henry Bromell hails the conquered hero with an absurdist wit and darkly delicious humor."
m/1104385-hannibal, Riveting suspense spiced with diabolical laughs and garnished with a sprig of kinky romance add up to the tastiest dish around.
m/1104813-down_to_earth," Not only has Rock's edge been smoothed over, so have his smarts."
m/1104841-sweet_november," Unfortunately, it's conventionality, Hollywood-style, that does in the film."
m/1105979-brothers," A mixed-message piece of sexist propaganda masquerading as a movie about sensitive guys, masquerading in turn as a movie for guys."
m/1105990-heartbreakers, A picture to be watched for its plot mechanics and very occasional laughs rather than with any engagement in its characters or the stakes involved.
m/1106020-someone_like_you," An enjoyable dramedy that is fairly obvious in where it is headed right from the start, but in getting there, it surprises in how moving and wise it becomes."
m/1106108-hamlet, This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations ever filmed.
m/1106648-lie," like a suburban, humanistic ""Kids"" without the sensationalism"
m/1107198-driven, Even the race scenes turn the goings on into Formula One for Dummies.
m/1107426-ace_in_the_hole," By no means a great -- or even a particularly good -- movie, but its sustained nastiness shows a stunning disregard for box-office niceties."
m/1107809-brother," An uneven, disappointing mix of violence and comedy."
m/1107902-angel_eyes," The tagline of the film reads: ""The deeper you look, the more you will find,"" but I've always found it pointless to search for treasure at the bottom of a dry well."
m/1108185-animal, The whole thing just felt like another dumb Saturday Night Live movie based on one joke.
m/1108206-evolution," Ivan Reitman, why remake your own Ghostbusters? It's like a neon sign blinking: 'No New Ideas Left!'"
m/1108372-fast_and_the_furious, About as cool as the fake rock music they used to play in Brady Bunch episodes when Greg and Marcia went to school dances.
m/1108389-pearl_harbor, Pearl Harbor is a film that has an extremely nice look. The cinematography seems far better than the writing.
m/1108520-1108520-time_and_tide," This is not Tsui's best film by a substantial margin, but it's immense fun."
m/1108624-road_home," Nos har reflexionar sobre nuestra historia inmediata y, lo ms importante de todo, nos har sentir que hemos regresado a nuestro hogar"
m/1108704-planet_of_the_apes, Perhaps most disappointing is the lack of psychological subtleties...
m/1108799-score, Offers little more than a strange combination of heist-flick clichs and cop-flick clichs.
m/1109137-heist," As capers go, Heist is considerably less than thrilling."
m/1109257-others," The low-key, handsomely photographed production drips with atmosphere and barely suggested menace."
m/1109679-hamlet," There's nothing embarrassing about Zeffirelli's brisk new version, nor anything particularly remarkable; it's an entirely credible, middle-of-the-road production."
m/1109942-big_trouble, Quick: who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security?
m/1110008-sidewalks_of_new_york," Pointed, upbeat, and very funny, ""Sidewalks of New York"" sets the standard for comedy in 2001."
m/1110236-wash," Halfhearted and badly edited, the picture itself seems stoned."
m/1110242-collateral_damage, Collateral Damage finally delivers the goods for Schwarzenegger fans.
m/1110288-count_of_monte_cristo, Reynolds is a deft and vivid visual storyteller whose flair for action pyrotechnics never devolves into incoherence.
m/1110294-on_the_line, There's more plot and inventiveness in the average 'N Sync music video than in Eric Aronson and Paul Stanton's sweet nothing of a script and antiseptic direction by Eric Bross.
m/1110646-uprising, A superior film that deserves real movie treatment.
m/1110925-invincible, Herzog fails to find the visual heart of Zishe's story.
m/1111103-texas_rangers, Enough horse-opera clichs to shame the makers of Gunsmoke.
m/1111227-iris," Despite the sad denouement, it's still the love story of the year."
m/1111496-james_dean," It's a hushed project that finds its grandeur in the cinematic approach from director of photography Robbie Greenberg, who gives pic the look of a bigscreen rather than a television project."
m/1111645-behind_enemy_lines," Uncomplicated war movie with straight-ahead, MTV-style action mixed with simplistic politics."
m/1112237-order, ...Van Damme even goes so far as to co-write the script - though I suspect his contribution was limited to the many lame one-liners peppered throughout the film.
m/1112357-scoobydoo," Unless you're a fanatic, the best advice is: 'Scooby' don't."
m/1112549-crossroads," Admittedly, I'm rather indifferent to Britney and her music, but still I didn't mind this film."
m/1112617-new_guy," Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming, it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful."
m/1112951-time_machine, More tragic than the uneven mix of jokes and schlock is the brevity of Irons' cameo role.
m/1112954-rookie," Solid, lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts."
m/1113375-showtime," One can't call a movie this stupid a ""satire"" of anything but unintentionally of itself."
m/1113402-human_nature," Anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed, joyous romp of a film."
m/1113638-murder_by_numbers," A picture by numbers. Director Barbet Schroeder connects each of the story's obvious dots with extra slowness, lest we miss guessing any of the turns."
m/1113649-enigma, It's a ripping yarn that recalls such early Hitchcock classics as The Secret Agent and The Man Who Knew Too Much.
m/1113658-joshua," In its own way, Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence, poetry, passion, and genius."
m/1114, can be viewed more like an exercise in style than film in its own right
m/1114051-enough, There's something trully reprehensible about a film less concerned with the plight of abused women than it is with beating them up for cheap thrills.
m/1114154-insomnia, A thinking person's detective story with an intriguing cat-and-mouse game between perp and investigator.
m/1114912-shiner," Opening with some contrived banter, cliches and some loose ends, the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half."
m/1115907-1115907-they, Robert Harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows.
m/1116086-trapped," A good, albeit over-plotted thriller with one major twist too many."
m/1116560-dogwalker," This isn't a retooled genre piece, the tale of a guy and his gun, but an amiably idiosyncratic work."
m/1116741-derailed, The sad truth is that those Brussels Muscles are just about all dried out.
m/1116774-swept_away," Far too predictable, irritating and never engages the viewer."
m/1117377-all_or_nothing, As good a picture of working-class desperation as you can get.
m/1118216-femme_fatale," Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects, not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos."
m/1118347-quiet_american, Its love story eclipses rather than complements the inherent spy thriller that skewers Yankee imperialism in the book.
m/1118522-one_week, Mitigates its gimmicky predictability and de rigueur uplift by resisting the lazy sentimentality of most AIDS dramas.
m/1118698-empire," Compellingly reinforces the adage, 'Never forget where you came from.'"
m/1118700-adaptation," So much talent in this project that even when nothing much is happening on screen, at least you are caught up in the characters."
m/1119026-pinocchio," Lethal for kids and an unspeakable insult to adults, this unreleasable fiasco is a torture for all."
m/1119037-nicholas_nickleby, This may just be the funniest Dickens film ever mounted for the screen.
m/1120513-lockdown," Despite a low budget and predictable story line, Lockdown has undeniable power to it, fired by some fine performances and a terrifying portrayal of prison life that rings disturbingly true."
m/1120843-hunted," Bearing a flimsy plot, 'The Hunted' looks like a paste-up job from any number of action movies."
m/1120975-shaft," Only thing worse than a bad horror film, is a horror film that's not scary."
m/1121133-avenging_angelo," Hopefully, someone will look at this film, realize that Stallone has the potential to headline a better movie again...and next time I'll be reviewing a film of his that isn't just 'endurable'"
m/1121649-anger_management, It's nothing short of a comedy catastrophe and a criminal waste of talent.
m/1121720-devdas," At over two and a half hours, the film's epic scale may not suit some Western viewers, but those willing to surrender themselves to the drama are in for a real treat."
m/1121728-lift, Often incoherent and disappointingly lacking in insights beyond the obvious.
m/1122382-spellbound," Blitz paints the spelling bee as an unusual incarnation of the American dream, one that combines the country's veneration for drive and intelligence with its lust for competitive sports."
m/1123000-carrie," The homogenized quality of much network fare is especially frustrating here, in what should have been, if not a heartfelt study of youthful angst, at least a horribly good time."
m/1123192-double_vision," A gripping bi-lingual drama with spiritual/mystic overtones, Double Vision is a well crafted entertainment with an intriguing premise."
m/1124832-divorce," A glossy, articulate and tasteful soap opera that will be catnip for Merchant/Ivory fans."
m/1124859-grind, A tip for filmmakers attempting to appeal to young moviegoers: Don't hire thirtysomething actors to play recent high-school graduates.
m/1125409-cabin_fever," Cabin Fever takes the standard conventions of slasher flicks and turns them on their ear, straddling the line between parody and originality and humping it madly. This is not your average walk in the horror park - this is a cinema fan's wet dream."
m/1125461-luther," Though LUTHER suffers from bio-pic-itis, it is more than just a pedestrian recitation of events."
m/1125540-dummy," So endearing and comedically 'real' are these characters that you'll want to stop the film, climb onscreen and give everyone a big hug."
m/1125611-suicide_club," ...contains an outstanding premise, but mucks it up with inexplicable plot developments and an infuriatingly open-ended conclusion."
m/1126165-good_boy," It's a wonder that the genre, started by the marvelous Babe, has any currency left after Cats and Dogs and Snow Dogs."
m/1126175-house_of_the_dead," The question in all these movies are who will survive, if anyone, but in this case, it's also a matter of who cares?"
m/1126416-mayor_of_the_sunset_strip," This wistful, soft-edged portrait of Rodney Bingenheimer, a social impresario of the Los Angeles rock scene, keeps its claws carefully retracted but still leaves a bitter aftertaste."
m/1127407-missing, Little Jenna Boyd gives a striking performance as feisty young Dot
m/1127652-big_empty," The Big Empty is much more a romantic fable than Swingers, the singles comedy that established Favreau but has a similarly jovial, unpretentious charm."
m/1127787-big_fish," By piling on the cuteness, Burton suffocates us with it. It's really a shame, because in most respects, this is a handsomely made movie."
m/1127803-highwaymen, A road trip you should definitely not take...one of those movies that generates plenty of unintentional laughs as it drones on.
m/1128319-american_gun," There isn't a false moment on screen for Coburn, who can do no wrong."
m/1128345-company, A wonderfully vivid and engaging theatrical experience.
m/1128577-peter_pan," Fantasy cinema has a habit of dividing audiences. That said, a lot of people are going to love Peter Pan."
m/1129132-torque, It's difficult to tell which is worse -- the acting or the writing.
m/112_weddings," Sometimes charming, occasionally sad, the couples' stories are often a joy to behold. The secrets of a successful marriage remain mysterious, however."
m/1130191-reckoning," In the final reckoning, this modern version of a medieval morality play, with its fine surface but problematic plot, proves more impressive for its body than its soul."
m/1130343-girl_next_door, The filmmakers end up with one too many Superman fantasies piled up on top of each other.
m/1131148-ned_kelly," A handsome production that pays great attention to authentic representation of the era, the legend and the landscape, Ned Kelly excels visually as it recounts a story that many may not fully know, albeit limiting our emotional connection with the man."
m/1131155-envy, A woeful little comedy that runs out of steam shortly after its opening sequence.
m/1131721-punisher," Alternating between hammy melodrama and rabble-rousing scenes of graphic violence, it's dishonest entertainment for adult-age children."
m/1132409-valentin, A very clever screenplay that somehow manages to be both hilariously funny and surprisingly poignant at the same time.
m/1133499-1133499-terminal," Starts off with a quirkily original premise before completely derailing in shallow subplots that go nowhere and a loathsome conclusion that wants, but fails, to be uplifting."
m/1133774-madeleine, One of three films Lean made virtually as star vehicles for his wife Ann Todd. Here she manages to extend the range of her semi-hysterical screen personality into a flimsily forceful character who pits her amoral deviousness against... rigid hypocrisy.
m/1133964-king_arthur," Strong dialogue, acting, and some sweet contemplative direction by Antoine Fuqua (of ""Training Day""). Not without fault, but Arthur's internal struggle carries."
m/1134219-lets_get_frank," Frank is a worthy subject, but this treatment amounts to not much more than a somewhat extraneous sidebar to last month's The Hunting of the President."
m/1134742-7_days_in_september," The documentary 7 Days In September does an exemplary job of acting as a vital memorial to the terrorist events of last September 11, and the one week in New York City that followed."
m/1135237-kal_ho_naa_ho," Hip, unrestrained, and silly all at once, Kal Ho Naa Ho is an example of earnest, unfettered exuberance."
m/1135414-24th_day, No amount of fidgety editing and anxious soundtrack atonality can distract from the creakingly implausible scenario.
m/1135882-uncovered_the_war_on_iraq," A rather redundant shredder, President Bush's war policy having shredded itself. But in force and focus this sober indictment is devastating."
m/1136026-almost_peaceful, Almost Peaceful is a good hearted period film that never really fleshes out its intent or its characters.
m/1136293-lightning_in_a_bottle, Wobbly documentary with some memorable blues performances.
m/1136501-pride_and_prejudice, It's a remarkable ensemble that becomes even more impressive in light of the fact that all are relative unknowns (at least for the time being).
m/1136634-journey," ""Amazing"" is the appropriate adjective to describe this latest IMAX film from MacGillivray Freeman Films."
m/1136907-late_night_shopping," ...an endearing comedy packed with characters that, despite being at times hard to believe or frustrating, you can't help but enjoy spending time with for 90 minutes."
m/1136973-black_cloud," If he can refine his writing and keep his heart in the right place, Schroder's next movie might offer the impact that 'Black Cloud' is missing."
m/1137202-lanas_rain," It has all the passion, frenzy and violence of an Abel Ferrara film -- but without the vision, depth, style or control."
m/1137476-everyday_people, Vividly depicts the changes taking place in the lives of the working poor in Brooklyn now that the traditional safety nets no longer protect them.
m/1139289-beauty_shop," 'Beauty Shop' has it all -- great performances, an empowering story and tons of laughs."
m/1140009-snake_of_june, Tsukamoto has matured since his Tetsuo days and proves more subtly disquieting than younger countryman Takashi Miike
m/1140781-dead_birds," The deliberate pacing of the movie does take a while to get used to, though, especially for viewers who like their horror movies fast and bloody."
m/1141099-hostage," It's nasty, violent, artistically barren and kind of fun."
m/1141102-are_we_there_yet, The type of fluff usually reserved for the likes of Tim Allen or a post-Nutty Professor Eddie Murphy.
m/1141193-hide_and_seek, An elaborate equation consisting entirely of bad horror tropes and trashy psychological symbolism.
m/1141548-sacred_planet," All fluff and no substance, and even though it's nice fluff (pretty pictures and nice tribal music), the message is so convoluted it doesn't even know what it's trying to say."
m/1141892-employee_of_the_month," ...we already have a Johnny Knoxville, thank you very much."
m/1142171-private_lives_of_elizabeth_and_essex," It's a war of minds and wills, but where it stands is at a point where Michael Curtiz still could direct ably, but the material wouldn't give way toward something better."
m/1142207-union_square, Stephen J. Szklarski's video documentary tracks the lives of seven young drug addicts who live in and around Union Square Park in Manhattan.
m/1142569-cursed," Cursed isn't a very good movie, but it's more an uninspired letdown than a flabbergasting turkey."
m/1142872-sky_high," a dull, kid-friendly regurgitation of readily available (and superior) iconographic comics"
m/1143677-snow_walker," Constant interruptions prevent the story from building to a satisfying emotional pitch, leaving the film, like the characters, to trudge circuitously across that vast frozen tundra."
m/1143922-devour, ...it's hard to imagine anyone walking away from the film satisfied (this includes the folks responsible for making the movie).
m/1144029-appleseed, So much to work with and all of it tossed in favor of banal platitudes and a star-crossed romance with all the tension of an oil-change and all the gravitas of an Archie comic
m/1144274-sahara, Highly entertaining romp from the pen of airport pulp king Clive Cussler.
m/1144535-nightmare_alley, A strange and rather sick movie made by highly talented people.
m/1144585-inheritance," Don't expect a ""they all lived happily ever after"" tale from helmer and coscripter Per Fly with ""Inheritance."""
m/1144622-moog," Even at his most obtuse ... Moog's deep, almost spiritual connection to his creation is evident."
m/1144992-crash, I think this is the kind of film that starts arguments and stimulates passionate discussion about topics that still make most of us cringe.
m/1146572-honeymooners, I've seen lots of horrible movies this year. I can't imagine them getting any worse than this.
m/1146673-1146673-stealth," Preposterous and predictable, Stealth hides 2 pleasures under its wings. It is laughably bad, and it provides the adrenaline pumping thrills of a video game."
m/1147402-the_muppets_wizard_of_oz," When you dig down and actually find (and watch) the new Muppet material, some of the magic is still there."
m/1148076-no_direction_home_bob_dylan, A document that will satiate Dylan fans over repeated viewings and should bring naysayers into the Dylan fold.
m/1148372-bad_timing," Noirish, erotic, chaotic and intense, Bad Timing grows in complexity and emotional power as it progresses, with a wonderful soundtrack and some exceptional cinematography."
m/1148583-pom_poko," Pom Poko isn't regarded as one of the tent poles of the Studio Ghibli canon, though it deserves to be."
m/1149472-skeleton_key," Engrossing, nice atmosphere, and with a clever twist."
m/1149496-1149496-red_eye," It pulls just about every nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat trick imaginable, yet gets away with it through what is, admittedly, a clever and original gimmick."
m/1150926-wall, Mur will appeal to those who are interested in a film-maker's personal meditation on the wall that literally divides the Israelis from the Palestinians.
m/1151490-bomb_the_system, Adam Bhala Lough's hot little melodrama rhapsodizes the lives of contemporary graffiti artists.
m/1151769-hellbent, This throwback to 1970s horror has a hilariously queer twist that makes it one of the most enjoyably crowd-pleasing fright flicks in ages.
m/1151780-venom," If the job of slaughtered-teenager movies is to dig up talented young actors who will eventually do better movies and wish they hadn't done this one, Venom excels in that area."
m/1151898-capote, An exceptional movie that digs deeply into an artist at the height of his creativity.
m/1151916-1151916-nine_lives, ...Garcia triumphantly opens our minds which makes him one of a few filmmakers to admire...
m/1151946-festival," For the most part, the stories are completely unrelated and therefore suffer from a feeling that some of the strands are completely redundant."
m/1152019-good_night_and_good_luck," A vital chapter of mid-century history is brought to life concisely, with intimacy and matter-of-fact artistry."
m/1152189-kids_in_america," An anti-Bush, pro-First Amendment, completely ridiculous fight-the-power comedy that happens to have been inspired by actual events."
m/1152276-rent, Jonathan Larson's heartfelt story shines through - despite the best efforts of director Chris Columbus.
m/1152567-jarhead," The filmmakers clearly wanted to avoid the politics surrounding the first Gulf War even as they pay tribute to the Marines, the jarheads, who went to Saudi Arabia to fight. But the result is a movie rife with ambivalence."
m/1152881-godzilla_final_wars," If this truly is his last outing, at least he's going out with a massive bang."
m/1152954-new_world, Features an endearing Native American heroine whose playful spirit and yearning for love takes her on a journey far beyond her wildest imaginings.
m/1153077-1153077-pride_and_prejudice, Writer Deborah Moggach's adaptation is sleek but lacks the judiciousness Emma Thompson brought to her terrific screenplay for Ang Lee's Sense & Sensibility.
m/1153228-the_ringer, This wannabe daring comedy about a man who attempts to 'fix' the Special Olympics strains for that patented naughty and nice balance with squirmingly squishy results.
m/1153319-land_of_plenty," Land of Plenty has a few too many coincidences and tends to be sugary, but it has an important precautionary message in this age of terror."
m/1153341-breakfast_on_pluto," Initially off-putting in mannerism, Cillian Murphy's 'Kitten' ropes the viewer in for the long, arduous haul."
m/1153853-mystery_of_the_nile, The beginning of the journey is much more exciting than the end.
m/1153951-curious_george," Rudimentary on every level, this long-gestating Universal pic based on the children's character is pitched toward the youngest of kids -- roughly ages zygote to 4 -- with direct-to-video quality animation, plotting and backgrounds."
m/1154157-big_mommas_house_2, The funniest thing about Big Momma's House 2 is what I believe to be a grammar error in its press notes.
m/1154356-promise, That Chen is able to somewhat collect himself and the film toward the end just highlights how potentially great the film could have been.
m/1154478-pariah, Randolph Kret['s ...] direction forcefully shows how the raw hatred of the skinheads regularly explodes into shocking brutality.
m/1155," It's Almanzar's controlled portrayal of a man who's learned from past mistakes and recent trauma, though, that will really haunt you."
m/1155109-hoodwinked," A fast-paced, fitfully clever 3-D-animated feature that will entertain tykes but provide scant novelty for auds who've had their fill of revisionist fairy tale gags and postmodern 'tude from the Shrek franchise."
m/1155467-glory_road," This Jerry Bruckheimer production, directed by commercial director James Gartner in a solid feature debut, should please male fans as well as those who don't mind a dose of social commentary with their sports heroics."
m/1155470-date_movie, The filmmakers don't seem to know when to cut a gag short and get on with things--every joke is stretched to the point where it ceases to be funny anymore.
m/1155622-why_we_fight, What makes Why We Fight so devastating is that it stands as a plea for reason in an age that expresses little use for it.
m/1156246-casanova," Sloppy and corny, and rather enjoyable if you like this kind of thing."
m/1156283-doogal," For all its undeniable promise, this take on The Magic Roundabout is just plain disastrous in its execution."
m/1156285-summer_storm," Beautifully shot, with natural acting and sensitive storytelling that honestly grapples with difficult themes."
m/1156352-adam_and_steve," Craig Chester's Adam is a whiney, neurotic irritant, the human equivalent of shingles."
m/1156415-on_a_clear_day, Dellal milks the funny business for maximum laughs without making any of the central characters devolve into caricatures.
m/1156587-clean," Can a misguided adult start afresh with a new set of values and priorities? This ambitious drama, directed by one of France's most resourceful filmmakers, explores that crucial question in depth and detail."
m/1156599-panic_in_needle_park, The Panic in the Needle Park rolls up the drug culture's sleeve and picks at the scabs underneath.
m/1157247-london," Richards recognizes and exploits Evans's beauty, self-reflexively using it as a red herring."
m/1157387-little_fish," It's a tidy showcase for Cate Blanchett as a recovering drug addict struggling to throw off the shackles of her past, but Sam Neill and Hugo Weaving also shine ..."
m/1157810-evil," not even a film as colossally absurd as Crash dares to completely sum up its entire train of thought in its one-word title, but such is the insult this 2005 Oscar nominee from Sweden commits."
m/1158179-devil_and_daniel_johnston, A compelling and obsessive humanization of American eccentricity.
m/1158185-see_no_evil, ... there's the assembly-line predictability of it all.
m/1158195-marie_antoinette," The feast, however sumptuous, should have had more than just cake."
m/1158528-goal, Uma goleada de clichês e estereótipos em um roteiro espetacularmente ruim.
m/1158609-dark, Escurido  pior do que um filme ruim:  um filme ruim que se recusa a chegar ao fim.
m/1158918-sleeping_dogs_lie, [The film] far exceeds the limits of how far a one-joke comedy can be extended.
m/1159100-oh_in_ohio," A first rate ensemble gets it past the censors, but not to a beachhead on the mainstream."
m/1159122-christmas_in_the_clouds," The kind of film in which you pretty much know that everything is going to turn out all right in the end. That doesn't mean, however, that one won't enjoy watching this warm and fuzzy exercise in escapism in the process."
m/1159135-hoax," Ultimately, The Hoax seems designed to appeal to the larcenous impulse in all of us."
m/1159169-for_your_consideration, [It] works chiefly because they continue to simultaneously embrace and condemn the cruel superficiality of their self-absorbed losers.
m/1159177-free_zone," With characters more often than not functioning as mouthpieces, audiences might feel like involuntary passengers trapped in the backseat."
m/1159365-standing_still," Surfing the crowd in Altman-lite style, pic skims the surface entertainingly but goes limp in its stabs at seriousness."
m/1159618-superhero," If you enjoyed movies like Mystery Men, My Super X-Girlfriend or even Orgazmo back in the day, then you just might crack a smile at The Dragonfly's spandex wedgie."
m/1159632-blue_butterfly, Literally half the experience of this movie involves watching the wildlife. And on this level The Blue Butterfly works magnificently.
m/1161005-straight_into_darkness," Reminiscient of Keith Gordon's fantastic A Midnight Clear mixed with a healthy dose of Rod Serlingism, Straight Into Darkness is a dark and stark little tale."
m/1161542-look_both_ways, It's not a perfect movie. But it's definitely not a filmed play.
m/1161913-big_white," Snowed under by misjudgment on every level, The Big White is DOA."
m/1162559-bobby," Cloying, but at other times, quite emotional, especially when Estevez draws less-than-subtle parallels between 1968 and 2006."
m/1162654-cavite," It's fast-paced and grittily entertaining, but never in that safe and generic way that most Hollywood thrillers shoot for."
m/1162685-land_of_the_blind," A labored pastiche of familiar dystopian motifs that beats the same, totalitarian-themed drum over and over again."
m/1162724-coastlines," By Nunez's high standards, Coastlines is conventional and outdated, a problematic hybrid of a generic crime melodrama and a more personal tale of a flawed hero who has fallen from grace and needs to restore his inner self (Nunez's specialty)."
m/1162756-slight_case_of_murder, Outdated mildly amusing black comedy that spoofs the gangster film.
m/1163536-unconscious," Played to the hilt by an inspired cast, this may not be the most subtle comedy ever made, but it has an impudence and an energy that atones for its occasional resort to contrivance and cheap gags."
m/1164119-breed," The Breed is not going to break any new horror or killer dog subgenre standards. As it stands, it is an acceptable time killer that won't challenge or offend."
m/1164158-stupidity," This documentary examines the ""dumbing-down"" of American culture, but it rarely reaches below the surface to explore why this is happening or what can be done to reverse the trend."
m/1164418-voices_of_iraq," By turns heartbreaking, amusing and disturbing, the film features people from different regions, economic classes and religions, recounting stories that are sometimes bleak, sometimes encouraging, but always compelling."
m/1164582-trade," A jarring mess of a movie, one that ends up seeming like no more than a particularly heavy episode of the CBS kidnapping drama Without a Trace."
m/1166140-abominable," To say that ""Abominable"" is the best movie ever to premiere on a basic cable channel is degrading both to the movie and to Bigfoot."
m/1166176-rest_stop," It's an embarrassing half assed horror film that goes nowhere, and I couldn't stand it."
m/1166226-red_doors, Doesn't bode well for the Tribeca Film Festival that this was considered the best dramatic feature.
m/1166237-pizza," There's a sharp and snappy tone to this irreverent comedy that keeps us laughing even though it's all a bit silly, really."
m/1166376-woods," Lucky McKee's latest is not as singular as May, but it's still a solid flick."
m/1166474-magus," The Magus not only suffers from [director Guy] Green's lack of intuition and precision (that is, everything that separates a didacticist from an artist), but also from Fowles' directly transcribed literary illusions."
m/1167633-driving_lessons," It has an appealing feel-good factor and could be this year's Calendar Girls, another Brit-flick sleeper hit."
m/1167811-ballets_russes, An affectionate look at the legendary dance comany.
m/1168076-angel," [Director Jim] McKay never finds an effective way to drive this paradox home, though he is an honest enough filmmaker to expose it."
m/1168577-cocaine_angel," If this film was intended as a joke, consider me fooled."
m/1169203-invisible, The Invisible is listless in conception and execution.
m/1169498-bridge, The decision to keep the process of filming out of the film robs it of too much context.
m/1170009-conversations_with_god," A hackneyed, melodramatic travesty is certainly to be expected from the cinematic rendering of Neale Donald Walsch's simplistic, best-selling self-help tomes."
m/1171939-perfect_stranger, Starring Victoria's Secret and Reebok as well as Halle Berry in her first mainstream hit in years.
m/1174085-vitus, Veteran Swiss filmmaker Fredi M. Murer's sentimental fable about a child prodigy and his difficulty fitting in with a world of ordinary people is poised somewhere between Searching For Bobby Fisher and Little Man Tate.
m/1174278-definitely_maybe," Sweet, funny, simple, entertaining -- everything a good rom-com should be. Definitely..."
m/1174279-wanted, Possesses a 'wow' factor that will make it one of the summer's biggest hits...an unabashed testosterone-adrenaline cocktail spiced up with a dollop of torture-porn bloodlust.
m/1174809-silk, As striking and insubstantial as its titular fabric.
m/1175072-license_to_wed," I was so tempted to walk out of License to Wed. And I have never walked out of a movie, not in my ten-year career as a film critic, not before."
m/1175076-fred_claus, Not a flake on the ground and we already have our first lump of coal.
m/1175079-antibodies, Alvart does put the viewer through a gripping experience with a final twist few will see coming.
m/1175174-funny_games," While I would stop short of calling Funny Games brilliant, I think it's forceful, unforgettable, and thought-provoking."
m/1175178-jane_austen_book_club, The Jane Austen Book Club is pitched as The First Wives Club for coffeehouse intellectuals.
m/1175374-fail_safe, It's a fabulous original film and a worthwhile redo -- but it comes about 20 years too late.
m/1175569-lars_and_the_real_girl," A timely reminder that love stories don't have to be crass or contrived to succeed, even if one of the star-crossed lovers is entirely artificial."
m/1175777-ghosts_of_abu_ghraib," Part broad exploration of human nature, part specific examination of Abu Ghraib, the film posits the question: how does one fight an enemy who recognizes no set laws of engagement?"
m/1175778-longford," Intelligent, thoughtful cinema for mature viewers who don't need special effects and quick cuts to feel engaged with a movie."
m/1176692-madeinusa, The assured debut of 29-year-old writer-director Claudia Llosa operates on several different levels.
m/1176779-10_mph," A very calm, quiet ride, but an intensely inspiring one. Many would benefit from checking this film out."
m/1176860-hurricane_on_the_bayou," Although its subject matter gets tossed around a little, ""Hurricane on the Bayou"" always gets its message across."
m/1177165-in_debt_we_trust, A damning documentary which indicts Americas as a Credit Industrial Complex where repossession and foreclosure have become commonplace rather than the exception.
m/1177708-descent," On the one hand,trying something new and the statement they want to make is laudable. However, the distanced style, hard grainy lighting and extremely lengthy rape sequences make Descent not only often unpalatable but also mostly just plain dull."
m/1177781-1177781-rally_round_the_flag_boys," Newman e Woodward parecem estar se divertindo a valer, mas o ingnuo roteiro no permitiu que o filme envelhecesse bem"
m/1178112-hollywood_dreams," Better pruning and different choices might have helped to shape the film into a more cohesive piece, instead of one so desperate to be funny that it sacrifices its honesty."
m/1178221-final_season," While obviously important to those who made the film, [it] probably won't hold that much interest to anyone not directly involved with the story."
m/1178348-the_last_time," For all the good work that went into it, the movie is as phony as a game of three-card monte."
m/1178444-take, Oliver's climactic twist merely nullifies any engagement with the characters' prior plights.
m/1178913-1178913-you_kill_me," With an eclectic mix of strong-minded thesps all pulling in slightly different directions, this shape-shifting genre hybrid successfully commingles 12-step therapy, romantic comedy and hit-man thriller."
m/1178952-amu," Too bad first-time writer-director Shonali Bose's juxtaposition of the personal and the political often feels forced, and like many didactic history lessons, this one's about 20 minutes too long."
m/11816, A fair and balanced poll taken on election day sporting a record number of directors (18).
m/1183512-as_you_like_it," With the director setting such a leisurely pace, the seventh step into total inertia takes hold well before the curtain drops."
m/1183674-hunting_party," He's telling the story of a post-war Bosnia so ignored by the international community, war criminals are free to list their names in the phone book. You can't make stuff like that up. But Shepard makes us think he did."
m/1183735-1183735-michael_moore_hates_america," Wilson is just a softhearted guy mistaking boldfaced imitation for bravery and 'truth'...Good heavens, the hypocrisy is deafening."
m/1183806-dirty_laundry," By far the best of a plethora of holiday family-reunion films, Maurice Jamal's warmly hilarious Dirty Laundry is particularly blessed with the presence of Loretta Devine"
m/1184415-evil_aliens," It's splattery and loud and frantic and laden with wall-to-wall gore of the nastiest kind. And yes, I mean that in the nicest way possible."
m/1184756-burning, ...a stylish thriller that generally fares better than the majority of similarly-themed horror endeavors...
m/1184827-alvin_and_the_chipmunks, When Lee's finally called upon to yell the trademark 'Alllllvin!' it feels like a forced whimper that only reminds us how stale the decades-old material is.
m/1185184-1185184-unknown_soldier," Structurally, the film itself is a pristine example of levelheaded journalism."
m/1185779-coffee_date, A warmhearted tale carried by genuine affection and a charming cast rather than cutting one-liners and turbo-charged plotting.
m/1185801-the_express," Occasionally engrossing but overlong biopic of late-1950s college football star Ernie Davis, the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy."
m/1186023-1186023-rape_of_europa, Focuses quite well on a relatively unexplored niche: the theft and also the destruction of valuable works of art by the Nazi regime during World War 2.
m/1186122-broken," A stagy piece that allows the audience to wonder how much is going on in the central character's drug-induced hallucinations and how much is real--No matter, though, since nothing is particularly dramatic or original."
m/1187621-itty_bitty_titty_committee," While the film is engaging, it feels unwilling to really push its themes into provocative territory."
m/1188209-1188209-strange_culture," Hershman Leeson crosses fiction and non-fiction for her astonishing, exasperating third feature."
m/1188215-blindness, Director Fernando Meirelles' adaptation of Jose Saramago's allegorical novel about a society that goes blind loses all credibility in Don McKellar's particularly naïve screenplay.
m/1188347-mad_money," This strained heist comedy about three cash-strapped femmes is watchable enough for a few reels, but lacks the requisite wit and amoral energy to capitalize on its get-rich-quick premise."
m/1188732-haunting_in_connecticut, About as scary as a shower that suddenly changes temperature when someone flushes the toilet.
m/1188868-billy_the_kid," In the end, it's the absent father figure that hobbles the story of a decent kid unable to edit himself for better or for worse."
m/1189010-tenderness," A movie undone by its formulaic plot conventions, and its need to give its star more screen time than his characters merits."
m/1189217-angels_and_demons," Director Ron Howard and his crew have worked hard to make Professor Robert Langdon's return a thrilling, faster-paced walk in the park."
m/1189344-lovely_bones," It's a great shame because Sebold's book showed us a world of pain, loss and love. That sense has been lost in translation."
m/1189416-shelter," Rowe displays new authority and confidence, as if lately he's been looking in the mirror and seeing himself, rather than that other, more famous blond."
m/1189629-the_great_buck_howard," A wonderfully refreshing and original film; this may be John Malkovich's best role and performance, maybe of his career."
m/1189844-the_bank_job," After several disappointing films, the gifted Roger Donaldson is back on terra firma with the nicely made, fact-inspired heist thriller, placed against England's social mores and sexual scandals just after the swinging era."
m/1190296-zack_and_miri_make_a_porno, Kevin Smith finally has a hit with Rogen and porn stars. Smith got the Ben Affleck curse lifted.
m/1190660-over_my_dead_body," [A] stilted, contrived, slapdash collection of lazily acted, badly written scenes thrown together into something that writer-director Jeff Lowell hopes you won't notice don't quite connect to one another..."
m/1190964-imagine_that," Imagine That is a benignly didactic kiddie movie that at once benefits from and gets buried under Eddie Murphy's skittery, overeager inflections."
m/1190970-ghost_town," Smartly supernatural, and featuring sensational performances by Ricky Gervais and Tea Leoni, Ghost Town is a Topper for our times."
m/1191620-college, This low-rent frat house comedy is at once far more vulgar and decidedly less anarchic than its obvious inspiration and should flunk out of theaters before this year's crop of freshman students even finish unpacking their bags.
m/1191742_changeling," Eastwood's femme-driven thriller explores police corruption and social injustice in an old-fashioned, studio-era-like film that lacks much nuance or complexity but is nonetheless enjoyable."
m/1192171-la_twister," In trying to qualify as mordant satire, charming rom-com, uplifting buddy movie about underdogs trying to stick it to the man and the most meta story ever told, L.A. Twister sprains itself badly."
m/1192193-life_is_a_bed_of_roses," Utopia is folly, though human fluidity here is the stuff of both Wagnerian myth and Gallic farce"
m/1192358-1192358-no_smoking," While intended as a comedy, there's not a scintilla of wit to be found here, let alone an honest-to-goodness laugh, and at over two hours, it goes way beyond a joke."
m/1192616-mister_lonely," After eight dark and reclusive years (including drug rehab), enfant terrible Korine is back with a disappointingly slight and whimsical fable about the romance between a Michael Jackson and a Marilyn Monroe impersonators, peppered with skydiving nuns!"
m/1192781-hell_ride," If you legitimately commit to the concept, let your mind go and accept the world that is onscreen then you can't help but enjoy yourself."
m/1192846-1192846-partition," Where the film stumbles is the script, overcrowded with bits of business and scenes that lean heavily on the symbolic."
m/1192938-smart_people, The director's recurrent habit of flooding his soundtrack with songs whose lyrics emphatically inform the viewer precisely what the characters are feeling is a repeated turn-off.
m/1193203-cottage, If there's a more depressing release this year then God help us all.
m/1193230-state_of_play," This well acted, mostly engaging politico-journo thriller is in the vein of 70s character-driven tales (Pakula, Pollack) the filmmakers admire and try to emulate with varying degrees of success, a possible result of three scribes with different approaches"
m/1193289-all_hat, There is no getting around that the film is as dry as an unpaved country road.
m/1193303-1193303-trumbo," Trumbo emerges as a son's bittersweet valentine to his old man, and a tribute to the senior Trumbo's resilience, wit, and outrage in the face of a national disgrace."
m/1193335-deal, Deal has to take the title of the worst film ever about the game and that includes the how-to videos with Joan Rivers impersonators you see in your Vegas hotel room.
m/1193377-chapter_27," Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which is pretty much the prime directive in filmmaking."
m/1193743-step_brothers, McKay keeps his comedy from straying too far into Adam Sandler turf by limiting the overt sentimentality and not letting the melodrama overwhelm the gloriously crass dialogue and intentionally childish conduct of Ferrell and Reilly who work well together
m/1193780-botched," Botched is bungled - irredeemably, at times even enjoyably, so."
m/1193825-noise," Like the car alarms it demonizes, Noise is insistent and initially attention-grabbing -- but eventually a little one-note and empty."
m/1194034-burning_the_future_coal_in_america, [David] Novack's...inability to tell a compelling story makes it difficult for us to summon outrage.
m/1194135-miss_conception," A pretty innocuous and bland bit of fluff, although some will undoubtedly be annoyed that it furthers the myth that all women in their 30s have insane baby-fever."
m/1194209-elegy," Elegy is a spare, melancholy film that is so far in spirit from its source, Philip Roth's The Dying Animal, that I'm tempted to say we should abandon altogether the idea of adapting Roth."
m/1194326-take," Furman stages the final foot chase with brio, but one wishes that he'd found a way to stay at home with Felix and Marina, who don't need guns to thrill."
m/1194403-all_in_this_tea," It's another beautiful, sensual film, and another homage to what makes life enjoyable."
m/1194515-ice_age_dawn_of_the_dinosaurs," A slightly more adventurous story breaks the trequel curse: this film is actually better than its predecessors. In addition to astoundingly eye-catching animation, this one also has a driving (albeit corny) narrative and some snappy new characters."
m/1194524-high_school_musical_3_senior_year," All these all-singing, all-dancing high-schoolers are downright adorable, and without being annoying about it, either..."
m/1194589-heart_of_the_beholder, HEART OF THE BEHOLDER succeeds in telling a compelling story in an entertaining and interesting way
m/1194626-fanaa," To resort to strictly ethnocentric references, Fanaa is equal parts MGM extravaganza, Shakespeare lite and James Bond. In their heart of hearts, isn't that what movie audiences really want?"
m/1194818-encounters_at_the_end_of_the_world," Midway through, an eerier theme creeps in, all the more powerful for Herzog's lack of insistence. By the 'end of the world' he means the end of the world."
m/1194825-phoebe_in_wonderland," Mystical and mysterious, with a delightfully out of focus child's perception of the world sure to give adults pause for reflection on the ethereal nature of reality, while Fanning's poetically expressive performance is luminous to behold."
m/1194870-poisoned_by_polonium_the_litvinenko_file," Although a first-rate investigative documentary on its own, Andrei Nekrasov's Poisoned by Polonium also serves as a sequel to 2004's Disbelief."
m/1194893-salaam_namaste," It's fair to say that the Melbourne setting--along with Khan and Zinta--makes the movie. Otherwise, it mainly feels like Bollywood business as usual."
m/1194949-wolfman," Written and crafted with great sensitivity, this is high class gothic horror"
m/1195103-happy_go_lucky," Mike Leigh draws a bravura performance out of Sally Hawkins, and she in return makes Poppy one of Leigh's best characters yet - up there with the likes of Vera Drake or Beverly from Abigail's Party."
m/1195796-viva, Anna Biller's pseudofeminist send-up of the sexploitation movies of the late '60s and early '70s remains as limp as the flaccid dongs at her film's nudist sing-along.
m/1195800-my_winnipeg," Reality or just another Maddin fever dream, whichever, the images are striking."
m/1195801-space_chimps," consistently goes for the cheap laughs, mining way too many jokes out of puns, pratfalls, and the occasional reference to poop (these are apes, after all)"
m/1195905-hounddog," Seriously, I'm astonished that anybody would try to pass this movie off as artistically or socially meaningful in 2007."
m/1195916-never_forever," Every scene is powerfully packed with conflict, and the movie races along to a very uncertain climax."
m/1196003-princess_and_the_frog, the movie more than works; a joy of animation is palpable throughout
m/1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs," A delicious farce and a backhanded slap at America the Obese, it may be the funniest animated film of the year."
m/1196177-lou_reeds_berlin," As shot by the incomparable Ellen Kuras, the concert retains a rich organic feel, complementing the music without over-determining it."
m/1196178-patti_smith_dream_of_life," Problem is, there's nary a hint of context, even with biographic essentials."
m/1196215-lakeview_terrace, Strong performances from its talented ensemble cast don't compensate for its narrative flaws.
m/1196221-quarantine," Quarantine is the unavoidable American replica, only this version has ingested a bottle of idiot pills and washed it all down with a full glass of directorial incompetence."
m/1196293-reprise," Trier's blend of genuine coolness, flesh-and-blood characters and a portrait of creative types that hits marrow, however, is a hat trick we'd gladly watch ad infinitum."
m/1196432-before_the_rains," [This] movie symbolizes the continued erosion of the Merchant Ivory brand into an entity producing films that belong on cable television, not in movie theaters."
m/1196557-my_name_is_bruce, The fact that My Name Is Bruce knows what it's doing doesn't mean it's funny.
m/1197016-mirrors, Kiefer Sutherland as a man having worse days than Jack Bauer ever has.
m/1197036-trapped_ashes," With its gore-comix sensibility and self-conscious flashes of nudity, Trapped Ashes clunks along, and (to be completely petty) never really overcomes its clunky title."
m/1197120-oss_117_cairo_nest_of_spies," Spoofy fun at first, but eventually wears quite thin, and I don't think all that much could have been lost in the subtitles."
m/1197200-my_father_my_lord," The movie, in its best moments, suggests a Haredi version of Terence Davies's 1988 masterpiece, Distant Voices, Still Lives."
m/1197307-ballast," It's really just Indie Filmmaking 101; the hand-held shaky-cam work and jump-cutting go all the way back to Breathless (1959), if not a million other films."
m/1197321-paris," After two continent-wide trips and a plunge into the French capital's underworld, French director Cdric Klapisch stays close to home and well above the ground for Paris, his valentine to the City of Lights."
m/1197334-never_say_macbeth," Former Chicagoan Joe Gold wrote and stars in this not bad little comedy that is long on theatrical tradition and stereotypical characters (including a few gay ones). Not surprisingly, the material would lend itself very well to a stage adaptation."
m/1197696-fantastic_mr_fox," Anderson's mannerisms have been irritating in the past, but pitching a film at children has restored his sweet-natured charm. This is hip - but with heart."
m/1197809-art_of_travel, It's too bad that there isn't a documentary about the making of The Art of Travel since that would undoubtedly make for an interesting movie.
m/1197992-perfect_game," Baseball movies generally lean toward the mawkishly uplifting, an inclination wholly embraced by The Perfect Game, which resorts to such corniness that one can practically hear the screen crunching."
m/1198124-shutter_island," Scorsese's in Cape Fear mode here, making his own version of the sort of thing that rocked his world when he was younger... [a] horror film, but with a haunted house that travels on two legs."
m/1198151-disfigured," Like Crash for the heavyset crowd, Glenn Gers's disFIGURED is a preachy message movie that collapses under the weight of its own self-important speechifying."
m/1198511-bustin_down_the_door, Includes of some of the most extraordinary surf footage seen since Bruce Brown's early Endless Summer films.
m/1198524-ninja_assassin," There's more to making sword-and-splatter work than just shiny blades and blood. It's got to have an edge, and the one on Ninja Assassin is dull as a butter knife."
m/1198569-recount," A splendid cast mostly just sits around watching the bad news on television, dutiful to the letter of Danny Strong's conscientious script yet insufficiently roused to righteous spirit even as, before their eyes, our republic gets banana'd."
m/1198658-i_love_you_beth_cooper," [A] joyless, offensively stupid end-of-high-school farce."
m/11_11_11_2011, One and one (and one and one and one and one) never quite add up to two.
m/11_minutes, The theme is nihilistic but its execution is thrilling.
m/11th_hour," May be a kindred spirit to An Inconvenient Truth, but in terms of style, tone, and scope, this Leonardo DiCaprio-produced and narrated documentary on climate change is a wholly different beast."
m/1200661-informant, The pic showcases an excellent performance by a chubbed-out Matt Damon as a Midwestern executive who's so smart he's dumb.
m/1200731-robocop," This remake of the 1987 dystopian classic has a better cast, more meticulous script and, naturally, flashier effects, but it lacks the original's wit and subversive slipperiness."
m/1200743-wrecking_crew," This sing-along, joyful doc unearths a group of musicians who actually played all the music on the LPS by the Byrds, Cher, Nancy and Frank Sinatra, the Beach Boys, the Monkees, and Captain and Tennille. A must to see and listen to."
m/1200797-closing_the_ring," Closing the Ring is well-acted throughout and it has a romantic appeal that is not to be sneered at, even if some may find it bland."
m/1200873-dorian_gray," Just like Dorian, it's all style and no substance. And valiant turns from Firth and co can't save this from being a melodramatic, overwrought mess."
m/1200985-nobel_son," Techs are better than Nobel Son deserves. Writer-director-producer-editor Miller does not have the chops, not yet, to pull off such a ponderous multi-hyphenate."
m/1201402-17_again," Check out 17 Again, an age-swap comedy co-starring Matthew Perry, only if you have daughters who will kill for a sight of heartthrob Zac Efron."
m/1202110-tooth_fairy," It's one of those reliable old cast-against-type comic turns that sends the character on a funny, predictable journey of sobering revelation."
m/1202111-greatest," It's quite a good film and is extremely well acted, but its emotional assaults were so powerful that I found myself almost unable to endure them."
m/1202171-labor_pains," The film is just a puddle of mediocrity from filmmakers who couldn't be bothered with putting some effort into their work, and a lead actress who's only trolling for a quick paycheck."
m/1202483-dark_streets," Dark Streets lost me early, real early, like still-adjusting-my-eyes-in-a-dark-theater early: Welcome to the blues, growls the entertainer with the mohawk and the full-length ringmaster gown."
m/1202487-book_of_revelation, The Book of Revelation is interesting enough to hope Kokkinos follows it with something equally daring.
m/1202507-open_window, I just couldn't buy into the way the film veered into a family drama when it started out so confidently.
m/1202804-green_zone, Greengrass orchestrates the action and the story with clarity.
m/1202807-easy_virtue," Enjoyable British comedy with a witty script, an amusingly quirky soundtrack and a terrific central performance from Jessica Biel."
m/1202867-dear_zachary, One can hardly watch what an unimaginable breakdown of Canadian law enforcement and protection of the young cost in loss and sorrow as the tale turns almost too painful to bear.
m/1203291-under_the_sea_3d," Gorgeous, informative and as gripping as a shark's jaws."
m/1203339-dance_of_the_dead, Never forgets its audience's sensibilities and makes for some truly great Halloween festivities...
m/1203528-fetching_cody, The final third of the script feels like an afterthought in a film that cannot bring any plausibility to its gritty setting nor its characters' plight because it began with an inherently sentimental plot device.
m/1203732-me_and_orson_welles," There are moments, especially when Welles is alternating between acting as Brutus and directing everyone else, that it's possible to forget you're watching an actor and really believe you're beholding Orson Welles at work."
m/1204891-center_stage_turn_it_up, Entertaining dance-focused romance has some mature themes.
m/1204946-children," This is a rare film that strikes a perfect chord between subtle and visceral scares, between the primal and the nightmarish, between surreal and survival horror...Tom Shankland delivers the most white-knuckled experience yet with The Children."
m/1205283-war_child," War Child, a documentary about the hip-hop artist Emmanuel Jal, is a bit ragged and repetitive, but certainly this young man's life is amazing proof that one person really can make a difference."
m/1205347-garbage_warrior," Garbage Warrior is, in the end, a fitting tribute to a free spirit and a valuable citizen."
m/1205377-last_house_on_the_left, Terrifying. Director Iliadis burns tension and Garret Dillahunt still scares me. Makes Ned Beatty's Deliverance rape look like a romance.
m/1205380-crazies," Impatient as they may be, the filmmakers never lose sight of what's important, namely keeping Dutton's rag-tag group of survivors sympathetic and perpetually in peril."
m/1205483_nine," A brilliantly animated and welcome treat for moviegoers searching for adventure, inspiration and complete originality."
m/1205530-three_stooges, Neither honors the Stooges' legacy nor provides any justification for bringing them into the present day.
m/1205668-lodger," The director playfully taunts with the copycat notion of a little of Jack The Ripper in any man, in this flashy when not murky copycat thriller, and those particular unhealthy fixations manifested in varying degrees on both sides of the law."
m/1205681-paper_man, The cure for the common dramedy: superhero sidekick Ryan Reynolds.
m/1205717-creation," Not much ""happens,"" though the pic does its best to maintain energy in both physical presentation and mixed-chronology structure."
m/1205903-our_man_in_havana," For those who regard Alec Guinness as the niftiest little con man on the screen, we will guarantee Our Man in Havana to be a source of immeasurable fun."
m/1206010-made_in_america," A doc with the thrust of entertainment, but the content of a thoughtfully researched book."
m/1206531-tennessee, Let's knock out the elephant in the room from the jump: Mariah Carey turns in a perfectly respectable performance.
m/1206664-free_style," Lower-class rage is addressed in a fashion that most movies -- let alone family ones -- shy away from. Which doesn't make this a good movie, but at least it has something on its mind."
m/1206674-helen," Unless you're prepared to be needlessly drowned in another woman's problems for nearly two hours, stay away."
m/1206848-four_flies_on_grey_velvet," As whodunits go, this is more of a ""who cares"". But as a work of celluloid skill, Four Flies on Grey Velvet has no equal. It's a great, great film."
m/1206853-weapons," The acting isn't the sole disappointment, the writing and directing was just as bad."
m/1207149-taking_of_pelham_1_2_3, A professionally mounted genre exercise which tries to please both the thriller and social drama crowds and suffers as a result.
m/1207523-obsessed," A trashy, empty calorie thriller that plays with racial bugaboos and DTV slasher conventions for a cheap, conversation-with-the-screen response. Oh my, this picture is junk food, but worse, it's an absolute toothless bore."
m/1207748-katyn, An example of how a master filmmaker can make the past--in this case a World War II-era massacre--possess a bracing immediacy. Polish director Andrzej Wajda's film earned an Oscar nomination last year despite its departure from every Hollywood con
m/1207887-sugarhouse," In Gary Love's determinedly gritty Brit-crim movie, three good actors chase around a script that keeps promising more than it delivers."
m/1207954-weather_girl," The broad performances, standard plotting and mild smiles recall a pleasantly predictable cable movie."
m/1208102-unmade_beds," Unmade Beds, with its occasionally twee chronicling of pogoing in funny hats and heart-to-hearts between NSA lovers, portrays its seekers as planets aspiring to bubblehood, or at least one tandem leap into the void."
m/1208105-adam," This credible and moving portrayal of a man with Asperger's Syndrome, whose passion for science and his love for a woman help him in his struggle to achieve a meaningful relationship, should find an appreciative audience."
m/1208128-tyson," Tyson won't shatter all your preconceptions, but if you don't at least question them, you haven't been paying attention."
m/1208165-boys_are_back," OK, it sounds like a tear-jerker, and sometimes it drifts dangerously close. But Owen, in a heartfelt, award-caliber performance, never goes soft. It's his core of toughness that makes the movie so funny, touching and vital."
m/1208173-splice," A powerfully brazen re-telling of an oft-told tale, but in this case ... it still works alarmingly well."
m/1208806-its_complicated, No one cries like Meryl Streep. And no one can make you laugh better when she's crying than the guileless icon that's defied Hollywood's inclination for putting actresses out to pasture at 40.
m/1208882-cove," A thoroughly shocking documentary that exposes the secret slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, Japan."
m/1208926-vinyan, ...it's ultimately impossible to deny the effectiveness of the astonishingly grim atmosphere.
m/1208_east_of_bucharest," The buoyant little comedy 12:08 East of Bucharest puts its finger on the problem in the best tradition of East European humor, savvy but concrete, gentle but sharp as a knife."
m/1209441-black_sun," ... the film has many sublime moments, offers great insight into the human condition and finds a visual vehicle for a story that's not just about sight, but about seeing the world"
m/1209767-mary_and_max, A melancholy true story of unlikely friendship which is another bold example of adult storytelling through animation.
m/1209777-new_york," Kabir Khan uses thriller conventions to address such issues as the suspension of civil liberties and the [US] government's ever-expanding power to harass, detain and deny due process to detainees."
m/1209933-puss_in_boots, Has enough charm and visual delights to compensate for its own storytelling shortcomings.
m/1210128-mystery_team," If this is the future of comedy in Hollywood, then there's little to fear -- as long as everyone remembers that brevity is the soul of wit."
m/1210171-reunion," Since no one in the cast is a household name, the series of confessions and critiques resemble nothing so much as actors' auditions."
m/1210249-last_word, Is this where The Last Word really wants to go? Into flimsy clich?
m/1210562-el_bano_del_papa, A pseudo-documentary that focuses on the hardships and penuries of their characters with such visual and dramatic intensity that its irony is often pushed aside.
m/1210749-eclipse, Wooden dialogue echoes across beautiful British Columbia.
m/1210830-antichrist, The trouble is that Antichrist feels progressively symptomatic of a director losing heart.
m/1210904-splinterheads," Splinterheads, which aims to be a quirkier Adventureland, never rises above mildly amusing."
m/1211138-baby_on_board, ...a seriously underwhelming comedic endeavor that suffers from an almost total lack of genuine laughs...
m/1211183-extract," The pic's attempts at comic portraiture feel sketchy at best, more or less assigning each character a single, belabored trait."
m/1211195-debt," Expanded review: Based on riveting story, this remake of the 2007 Israeli film is a gripping if implausible thriller, offering commentary on the making of political heroes and myths; at this phase, Helen Mirren can do no wrong."
m/1211197-everybodys_fine," Under the helm and pen of Kirk Jones what was a sensitive and touching dramedy in Tornatore's 1990 film has become conventional, predictable and schmaltzy, forcing the actors, especially the estimable De Niro, to emote in a big way."
m/1211199-last_night," The movie moves forward in a reductive will-they-or-won't-they-cheat fashion, without much depth or character-driven insight."
m/1211483-howl, The filmmakers don't get everything right but their passion for Ginsberg's genius and their excitement over trying to deconstruction a literary master work is contagious. A more perfect film might have been just a teensy-weensy dull.
m/1211512-life_during_wartime," Although softer and a wee bit more hopeful than its predecessor, the script is as corrosively caustic, taking familiar potshots at gaudy, sterile suburbia (sorry South Florida and New Jersey)."
m/1211532-friends_of_eddie_coyle," A good, tough, unsentimental movie about the last days of a small-time Boston hood."
m/1211577-skeptic," A mechanical compendium of anti-skepticism clichs, right down to the obligatory post-realization upchuck."
m/1211619-remember_me," The relevance of the film's title only becomes clear at the film's ill-conceived end, in a dragged out sequence that totally overshadows the film's already flakey premise. The best thing that can be said of the film is that it is well intentioned"
m/1211777-uncle_nino," Though convinced it's helping people to rediscover their roots, the film succeeds only in planting corn."
m/1211910-what_goes_up, Given its title and direct linkage to the 1986 Challenger shuttle disaster -- nearly adds tasteless to its unflattering hat trick.
m/1212085-home, It would have been more effective if Meier had exercised less restraint and allowed her characters to spin out of control.
m/1212111-triangle, If you can get past its logical inconsistencies - and they are legion - it's not bad.
m/1212267-blast," Mildly engaging, stylishly edited, sporadically provocative and suspenseful, but more analysis and insightful revelations would have made it a truly enlightening experience rather than an ultimately underwhelming one."
m/1212410-get_him_to_the_greek," The real story here is P. Diddy, who owns this movie. At the end of the second act he explodes as a comic dynamo."
m/1212440-home," Though there is little here for an informed person to take issue with, the film's well-intentioned preachiness is unlikely to win over those who favor Genesis and denial over climate science."
m/1212593-end_of_the_line," The poignant facts and figures are offered by a host of likeable marine scientists, local fishermen and activists."
m/1212640-eclipse, A much duller tale than its Irish literary festival setting would suggest.
m/1212694-blind_side," Its m.o. isn't understanding or identification, just white self-congratulation."
m/1212720-stone_of_destiny," Based on a true story, this rousing caper adventure can't help but keep audiences engaged. It's an efficiently made, if not particularly inventive, old-style romp that works away at your cynicism until you find a lump in your throat."
m/1212891-furry_vengeance, The animals here don't talk; that's the movie's one saving grace.
m/1212910-warrior," 'The Fighter' is the one that's based on the true story, but between the two, 'Warrior' not only feels more authentic, but it's a slightly more enjoyable watch, too."
m/1212946-beyond_a_reasonable_doubt," Noisy and excessive where the original was hushed and restrained, and wholly devoid of mystique..."
m/1213205-prophet," Its similarity to pulp Hollywood - in a festival context, a valuable antidote to art-house sprawl and drift - now makes it seem more rather than less generic."
m/1213377-homecoming," Nothing in the film is truly, laughably bad, but then -- unlike this year's Obsessed -- nothing is campily entertaining, either."
m/1213536-american_son," Stirringly told, American Son dramatizes a harsh social reality and tributes this nation's fighting force."
m/1213593-narrows," Serviceably enjoyable, like cold pizza but little more."
m/1213684-big_fan," Roll over Quentin Tarantino and tell Robert Rodriguez the news. With Big Fan, Robert Seigel proves that the existential poetics of popular culture have a new laureate."
m/1213717-salt, a knuckle-headed action movie that has less creativity or ambition than it does money and star power
m/1213718-did_you_hear_about_the_morgans, A fish-out-of-water story with a bit of a freshness issue.
m/1213731-worlds_greatest_dad," The movie takes a little longer than necessary arriving at the inevitable, somewhat hokey ending, but it's pretty funny along the way."
m/1213732-no_impact_man, No Impact Man -- the film and the book -- could well end up instruction manuals.
m/1213734-ghosted, A clumsily supernatural mystery that strangely uses the fallible density of flesh as its most underscored symbol.
m/1213735-death_in_love," A stagy, melodramatic, and downright effective story about the way a mother's pain is passed on to her brood."
m/1213737-x_games_3d_the_movie," A relatively unimaginative take on the proceedings, coupled with occasionally bizarre stereoscopic work and awkward narration, causes the pic to bail out more often than it soars."
m/1213870-nollywood_babylon," For all its limitations, Nollywood Babylon serves as an intriguing primer."
m/1213991-way_we_get_by," An extraordinary documentary that celebrates the heroism and the spiritual practice of kindness in the lives of three elders who serve as troop greeters in Bangor, Maine."
m/1213994-five_minutes_of_heaven," Powerhouse performances by Liam Neeson and James Nesbit make this an intense, ultimately moving tale."
m/1213999-brothers," Brothers is that rare animal, a US remake of a fine foreign language film which works on both a creative and thematic level in its conversion to an American setting."
m/1214027-collector," If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then ""The Collector"" flatters the heck out of ""Saw."""
m/1214049-one_week, ...a moving and tremendously involving piece of work.
m/1214055-hills_run_red," a horror film about horror films, replete with not only crowd-pleasing shock and gore but also funny deconstructions of the fixed clichs of slash and dash... but there is little here we have not seen before, ironic self-referentiality and all."
m/1214097-despicable_me," Lo, another 3-D animated kid movie demonstrates that cartoon storytelling pitched to young people is the last, best refuge of sprightly filmmaking this hard, hot summer."
m/1214112-disappeared," Johnny Kervorkian sets up the film nicely, but by the end, your worst fears are realised when it climaxes in the most anodyne way possible."
m/1214585-apres_lui," An intricate, intimate drama, After Him is a risky venture, in which audiences have to either opt in or opt out."
m/1214588-poker_house," One of those autobiographical films... like Running With Scissors... that shows how children can survive and even prosper emotionally, spiritually (eventually) despite a ghastly childhood"
m/1214678-deadgirl," A pitiless look at the worst aspects of teenage male horndog-dom ... if there weren't some poisonous kernel of truth in its grotesque, testosterone-poisoned ""what if?"" premise, no-one would be squirming."
m/1214788-meerkats," Like the real-life natural-world Disney features of yesteryear, there's a huge amount of entertainment to be had, especially for kids, although the imposition of a story and the attribution of various emotions to the creatures can get slightly cloying."
m/1214904-run_robot_run," Aside from the great look at a possible future yet to be, it's also a bliss of comic feeling and occasional romantic bursts. Guys, if you're desperate for a rom-com you can actually stomach, go get Run Robot Run!"
m/1215016-anita_oday_the_life_of_a_jazz_singer, Superb study of one of America's greatest jazz singers who lived to perform. The movie is a labor of love co-directed by her manager from the last 6 years of his life and a reminder that movies come alive when there is passion rather than money in the dri
m/1215790-carriers," This thoughtful, low-key exploration of our darker survival instincts is too conventional and unfocused to fully engage our emotions."
m/1215791-earth_days, A well-meaning film about environmentalism is marred by pounding music and a lack of humor.
m/1215792-amreeka, Uplifting story of a resilient Palestinian mother and her son struggling to make a new life in America: hope is the tonic that keeps her going and you will find yourself cheering her on every step of the way
m/1215969-i_sell_the_dead," I Sell the Dead sports playful genre inventiveness, in which fans can delight and even outsiders can enjoy."
m/1215970-my_one_and_only," A colorfully written, expertly directed and beautifully acted romp about the early life of actor George Hamilton that is guaranteed to make you feel warm all over."
m/1216015-horse_boy," The healing odyssey, directed by Michel Orion Scott, provides a powerful look at the complex condition of autism and family dedication."
m/1216067-fifty_dead_men_walking, It is Jim Sturgess who dominates with a charismatic performance that creates an empathy with McGartland as he journeys from arrogant hustler to vulnerable IRA insider crushed by the impossible demands of his double life.
m/1216754-art_and_copy," It's entertaining as far as it goes, a highly watchable portrait of one of America's most distinctive communication tools."
m/1216813-triangle, The cinematic equivalent of an inedible mess where ingredients war with one another and no one has paid any attention to the poor fellow who must consume the meal.
m/1216923-franklyn," The gothic world of the early scenes promises an adventure that never comes. The style is needlessly impenetrable, yet the theme is simple enough."
m/1216924-ink," A movie that needs to be seen, and it's a film that deserves to be celebrated."
m/1217083-passing_strange," The cutting is hyperkinetic, yet Lee is always in synch with the cast's phenomenal energy. He's in their thrall -- and so are we."
m/1217389-we_live_in_public, The internet indicted as a mind control tool subtly turning humanity into exhibitionistic automatons.
m/1217459-staten_island, Staten Island has the stench of meat left on the counter for too long.
m/1217700-kick_ass, Kick-Ass offers some genuinely clever observations about the creation of celebrity in a world where viral video clips and latenight talkshow quips can turn attention seekers into overnight sensations (and inadvertent role models).
m/1217834-motherland, Steinman's high concept is unwieldy and overly ambitious and occasionally skirts reality TV territory -- one of the women even jokes about being voted off the island -- but the shots of the children beaming in the company of these mothers are glorious.
m/1217843-know_your_mushrooms," ... a highly entertaining trip through the facts and fictions of fungi, from ancient culture to counter-culture to epicurean treat."
m/1217993-loren_cass," Angry white males with suicidal tendencies are people, too!"
m/1218013-white_on_rice, Watanabe's performance sucks any remaining sweetness right out of this fish-out-of-water comedy; you're ready to call the police once he starts stalking his hot cousin.
m/1218060-blind_date, A well-written and insightful drama built around two beautifully modulated performances by Tucci (who directed) and the always-marvelous Patricia Clarkson.
m/1218217-single_man," Every frame in this film is visual perfection, capturing settings and characters with artistry that packs a real wallop"
m/1218218-not_forgotten," It's a cliche-addled, nonsensical bit of piffle that would rightfully have vanished into the deepest recesses of the used-DVD dollar bin if not for the fortunate casting of television's Mentalist, Simon Baker."
m/1218219-passchendaele," Passchendaele hearkens back to war films of decades past, when patriotism, valour and integrity were presented without irony. But it is infused with the stoicism of people who know it is their job to try to find meaning within an insane situation."
m/1219638-ice_people," Global warming is the subtext, I suppose, but Anne Aghion's film is really about the gritty, quotidian nature of science."
m/1219933-lailas_birthday," Laila's Birthday is beautifully shot and overlaid with a spare, lyrical score that lends rueful emphasis to Masharawi's exasperated fidelity to a chronically malfunctioning city."
m/1220355-shank," Simon Pearce's Shank successfully treads the line between sweet romance, gay soft-core porn, gang violence, and aimless exploitation."
m/1220545-children_of_the_corn," Good cinematography. It hits the right grim tone. Otherwise, about as enjoyable as getting a popcorn seed stuck in your teeth."
m/1220551-bounty_hunter," In The Bounty Hunter, the couple that foils a bunch of tiresome grade-C thriller goons together stays together. Whether or not that's a recipe for love, it's certainly not a formula for romantic-comedy magic."
m/1220683-chevolution," Film-makers Trisha Ziff and Luis Lopez ask how and why the wisdom of the crowd decided that this image should not merely be a badge of youth radicalism, but an icon of purity."
m/1221008-breaking_point, There isn't any clich that writer Vincent Campanella and director Jeff Celentano don't treat with stoic reverence.
m/1221112-che," All in all, it's a highly worthwhile, professionally accomplished project, but in its obsessive devotion to precise documentation, the film forgets to inspire."
m/1221547-alice_in_wonderland," Tim Burton's sensibility as imagist-fabulist fits the text, and though there's much to admire visually, the film unfolds as a series of set-pieces, lacking heart, dramatic continuity, involvement, and gravity."
m/1221991-englishman_in_new_york, Hurt's perf gives some dramatic continuity to a production that is more a succession of setpieces than a through-drama per se -- at least until its affecting later stages.
m/1223214-fix, An engaging work of no small charm -- and one of the few exercises in first-person narrative filmmaking I've seen that really works.
m/1226720-waveriders," Initially, Waveriders looks like surf porn, but quickly reveals itself to be the story of the sport's unlikely genesis."
m/1226723-tony," The problem is that there's no character development, no revelations and no epiphany. The film is merely nauseating."
m/1226860-losers," Hot on the trail of ""Kick-Ass,"" last week's experiment in vacant cartoon violence, ""The Losers"" is just as disgustingly wrongheaded."
m/127_hours, What could have been static and deadly dull comes blazingly to life in this powerful and compelling story of one man's will to survive.
m/12_monkeys," The sort of movie that disappears on you as soon as you leave the theatre, but it's a great ride while you're there."
m/12_oclock_boys_2013," 12 O'Clock Boys is one of those rare, unforgettable films, so tightly constructed and beautifully executed that it's hard not to want to watch it again immediately."
m/12_rounds," Cinematically this is by-the-book multicam crash-and-burn spectacle that lacks originality but has spades of energy and a few truly suspenseful moments. Doesn't quite make it worth your time, though."
m/12_strong," It's virtually all Hemsworth's show and he's entirely up to the task of carrying the film on his broad shoulders: He's charismatic, fearless, confident, jokey and a good old Kentucky boy who just wants to get the job done ..."
m/12_years_a_slave," Northup's story was a true, terrible thing, and by virtue of telling it, the burdens of all American slaves are unflinchingly realized by Ejiofor and McQueen alike."
m/13-2010," ""13'' is Gela Babluani's American remake of his successful 2005 Georgian-language film ""13 Tzameti.'' He should have left well enough alone."
m/13_assassins_2011, Surprisingly few surprises in this classic samurai costumer from Japan's dark iconoclast Takeshi Miike.
m/13_cameras, Generic exploitation thriller that isn't exploitative enough.
m/13_ghosts, It falters just as most of today's movies falter: too much emphasis on effects and not enough on characters.
m/13_going_on_30," Jennifer Garner makes the transition from cult-fave TV action icon to full-fledged, ultra-charismatic feature lead in 13 Going on 30."
m/13_hours_the_secret_soldiers_of_benghazi, Bay uses all of his bombastic filmmaking tools to flatten out a complex geopolitical situation -- and the people caught up in it.
m/13_sins, There's a reason these Faustian tales keep sprouting up in our pop culture. We're fascinated by how we would respond in the same nightmarish situation. And Daniel Stamm is fascinated by us.
m/13_tzameti," Shot in black and white, '13' maintains a strong disconsolate tone, one in which the world feels barren and uncaring."
m/13th_warrior, The 13th Warrior seems like a made-for-TV warrior movie without enough money to get really epic.
m/1408," Haunted houses aside, never were buildings such immense sources of creepiness and fright before 9/11."
m/1492_conquest_of_paradise," Not quite sure why this one tanked as badly as it did; I thought it was gorgeously realized, myself."
m/14_blades," a breathless dash through the desert, as spectacular as it is slyly sentimental."
m/14_cameras," The thing is, there's also a lot of better stuff out there on this theme, and so although this isn't wholly awful, there's not much reason to give it 90 minutes of your life."
m/14_hours," Estria de Grace Kelly no cinema, Horas Interminveis  irregular, mas interessante."
m/15_minutes," The film seems exaggerated strictly to pray upon latent public fears in a calculated, predatory way."
m/15_years, Yoav becomes such an oppressive presence that it is difficult to empathize with him.
m/16_acres, This alternately amusing and heartbreaking documentary coherently chronicles the endles process of rebuilding Ground Zero.
m/16_blocks," It's a small movie trying to seem epic, or a bloated monster trying to seem lean (real B movies don't have 14 producers), but it's clear that at 99 minutes, 16 Blocks should've been at least 20 minutes shorter still."
m/16_years_of_alcohol, Richard Jobson's debut is full of abiding images that linger long after the final credits.
m/17_girls_2011," A rare film focusing on the feelings, fears, dreams and emotions of girls."
m/180-south," If we're going to keep getting documentaries about the environment -- and let's face it, we are -- 180 Degrees South suggests an original way to structure them."
m/18_presents," Contrived, manipulative? Sure. But sweet and subtle and even surprising."
m/1900, The mannered elegance of the camerawork and lighting cocoons the whole sad mess within a veneer of utterly spurious 'style.'
m/1917_2019," It may be a grandiose flourish, but you can't deny it makes for a startlingly literal theater of war."
m/1922_2017, Thomas Jane's dramatization of rage is haunting and shrewdly comical in its overt and ultimately moving über-manliness.
m/1941," I love 1941. I don't apologize to you, or my fellow critics, or even Spielberg for that."
m/1982_2013," 1982 is a ham-fisted morality tale about love, marriage and the fallout of the '80s crack epidemic as though told by someone whose intel on all three came primarily from pulp sources."
m/1984_1984, 
m/1985_2018," Anchored by a deeply felt central performance from Cory Michael Smith, the modest but affecting film should find a receptive niche with LGBT audiences."
m/1_2013," In trying to say everything, ""Plus One"" reveals it doesn't have much to say at all."
m/1br," All of this boldness pays off-the film's third act might end at an expected place, but 1BR stands out with how it gets there, and the unique horror along the way."
m/20000_days_on_earth," In a backhanded way, this considered, half-fictional approach perfectly serves an artist who has always been in the process of making and remaking his own mercurial image."
m/2001_a_space_odyssey," The movie is so completely absorbed in its own problems, its use of color and space, its fanatical devotion to science-fiction detail, that its is somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."
m/2010_the_year_we_make_contact," Not nearly the addicting mind-trip that ""2001"" is, but not half-bad in its own right."
m/2011," Andy Lau and Gong Li are appealing leads, but this Chinese-language carbon copy doesn't find a distinctive voice."
m/2012," A deliriously ludicrous, guilty pleasure of a blockbuster in which the end of the world is turned into a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride."
m/2016_obamas_america," While it's highly unlikely that anyone predisposed to championing Obama would be won over by the sound and fury here, there's no gainsaying the value of 2016 as a sort of Cliffs Notes precis of the conservative case against [Obama]."
m/2050," 2050 is ostensibly a film about sex robots, hand-crafted by Dean Cain. But really, it's just a movie about terrible people rationalizing terrible behaviors in the most verbose, unnatural ways possible."
m/20_centimeters," Monica Cervera's fearless performance as the homely Marieta, whose movie-made dreams of glamour will never come true, is mesmerizing."
m/20_feet_from_stardom," This joyous documentary leaves us wanting to immediately seek out the incredible, sometimes unfamiliar music we've just heard."
m/20_million_miles_to_earth, Nathan Juran's film differs from most sci-fi monster movies of the period in that the monster shows up early and often.
m/20th_century_women," There is a generous amount of visual and intellectual wealth to unpack in Mills' exquisite 20th Century Women, where female lives are revered, wrinkles are earned, and the idea of a perfect future is astutely confronted."
m/211," ""211"" plays more like a TV pilot than a feature film, slowly losing interest in the gritty aspects of the story."
m/21_2020," Polished in its execution and playfully noncommittal in its storytelling, the film could be viewed as a metaphor for the disparate connections forged in a digital, globalised society."
m/21_and_over, What you'd expect from the writers of the Hangover movies
m/21_grams, Pretty solid as an exercise in style but thematically unconvincing.
m/21_jump_street_2011," Holding its middle finger up to '80s retro-hounds, this remake gets it largely right. Fast, filthy, fresh and funny, Jump is worth a punt."
m/21_years_richard_linklater, 21 Years: Richard Linklater is a puff piece about the American indie film titan that lacks the insight and analysis necessary to make it a strong retrospective of a great artist.
m/222_2017," The film starring the German Michiel Huisman, it doesn't consolidates itself as an action thriller. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/22_bullets," Without a compelling plot to hold our attention, this only amounts to an impressively bloody bullet-a-thon: 22 seems a very conservative estimate..."
m/22_july," There is a technical facility to the film that's almost too good, that zaps past too much like its part of the 24-hour news cycle."
m/22_jump_street," While 22 Jump Street becomes a little too self-aware for its own good, Tatum and Hill's bromantic chemistry delivers an acceptable amount of laughs for your typical summer blockbuster."
m/24_city, The complexity of [Zhangke's] postmodernist formal gambit nonetheless gets at something pressing.
m/24_days," As a suspenseful true crime story, ""24 Days"" succeeds. As a warning against the ever present dangers of anti-Semitism, it is eloquent and disturbing. It's in combining the two that Arcady mishandles the case."
m/24_exposures," In this sleek yet confessional drama by the prolific filmmaker Joe Swanberg, the boundaries of art and life are probed with a knowing yet uneasy directness."
m/24_hour_party_people," An often exhilarating portrait of the passionate, mad individuals who took no prisoners as they forged a new musical culture."
m/24_hours_on_craigslist, The disorganized documentary 24 Hours on Craigslist is primarily a stroll through human desire as manifested on the popular Internet site Craigslist.org.
m/24_hours_to_live_2017," Hawke delivers a workmanlike performance, but can't redeem the third act's macho baloney ..."
m/24_redemption," Sutherland plays an appealing and reluctant hero, as he saves a group of African children targeted for kidnapping by the militia"
m/258," The work of a lunatic using his own feces to outline an uncomfortably abstract tale of ridiculous possession, brought to life through some of the most excruciatingly obvious and colossally stilted dialogue Ive heard so far this year."
m/25th_hour," Maybe Spike Lee's response to 9-11 is shellshock and confusion, but that's not enough to build his latest movie on."
m/27_dresses, Bland. Difficult to believe it was written by the scripter who penned The Devil Wears Prada.
m/28_days, Sandra Bullock's best film in years -- perhaps even the best work she has ever done.
m/28_days_later," The zippy, brutal action sequences are gripping, the violence sometimes shocking."
m/28_hotel_rooms," In its own small way, in documenting two people who want to be together but are too scared to commit, Twenty-Eight Hotel Rooms is masterful."
m/28_weeks_later," Unlike the original movie, it has absolutely nothing to say except stay tuned and give us your money."
m/2_autumns_3_winters," A determined lack of formality gives the film its sense of immediacy and edginess, though this is largely wasted as spontaneity is largely absent."
m/2_brothers_and_a_bride," This is one case where the director would have been better off pointing his camera at real subjects. The truth, in this case, is almost sure to be stranger than the fiction."
m/2_days_in_new_york, A scattershot culture-clash comedy that goes down like yesterday's foie gras.
m/2_days_in_paris, A pair with good chemistry who are ultimately mismatched--he a neurotic New Yorker and she a man-hungry Parisian--make for solid comedy entertainment.
m/2_days_in_the_valley, A jumbled hodgepodge with an excess of plot masquerading as hip thriller.
m/2_fast_2_furious," Sometimes you'll laugh with the film, sometimes at it, and sometimes you'll be fumbling for the seatbelt."
m/2_guns, Charm makes up for ludicrous plotting in twist-heavy crime story.
m/2_in_the_bush_a_love_story_2019," Two in the Bush mixes comedy with deeply emotional moments. The result is highly relatable content which one can identify with whilst laughing at how ridiculous humans can be, specifically when dealing with love."
m/2_jacks, It's a reasonably entertaining portrait of disreputable Tinseltown types that should at least provide some knowing chuckles for insiders.
m/2nd_date_sex, Alexandra Roach and George MacKay deserve each other in the sweetest possible way.
m/3-backyards, Eric Mendelsohn's first film since 1999's Judy Berlin suggests Little Children as helmed by a nature documentarian.
m/300," I preferred Gerard Butler as the Phantom of the Opera, didn't you? But he was just dandy here as well."
m/3000_miles_to_graceland," Goes through all the usual motions of a heist film -- heist, betrayal, chase, showdown -- and then, in case you missed them the first time, it goes through them again."
m/300_rise_of_an_empire," Rise of an Empire isn't without its highlights. Most notable is Eva Green's bat-s**t mad Artemisia, a villainess who chews the scenery so emphatically that there'd be teeth marks on the sets if they weren't all digital."
m/30_beats," Under the circumstances, even first-rate New York stage actors like Thomas Sadoski and Justin Kirk seem uncertain and tentative."
m/30_days_of_night," 30 Days of Night grabs this hoary monster by the throat, pumps it full of the thick rich blood of life, and shoves it out to greet you, eat you, and coat you in glorious mists of red firing from oh-so-many newly exposed arterial sprays."
m/30_miles_from_nowhere," One of the films greatest successes are its subtleties, Koller's ability to not give in to an Evil Dead style bloodbath finale makes... a smart and unexpected ending to make space for that appreciation of realism"
m/30_minutes_or_less," A funny and fast-paced blast of silly energy, willfully dumb with a clever streak that keeps it afloat just long enough."
m/30_years_to_life, Don't let the title fool you into dismissing this as another Steven Seagal action snooze.
m/31," Why Rob Zombie felt the need to mask this pile of garbage is unfathomable, though perhaps he knew it was a blatant regurgitation of everything he's done before, which means everything he's aped previously."
m/31-north-62-east," Writer-director Tristan Loraine has grand schemes in the pipeline, but this absurd stab at sub-Tom-Clancy conspiracy thrills won't help his credentials. When Craig Fairbrass is your closest thing to a badge of quality, be afraid."
m/310_to_yuma, three great performances that will satisfy you even if you don't like cowboy flicks.
m/33_postcards_2011, 33 Postcards is merely the latest in a long line of films to throw in needless crime subplots as a way of shortcutting things emotionally.
m/360_2012," It's too well acted to be a turkey, but it completely lacks the vibrancy or excitement of City Of God or the craftsmanship that has distinguished Morgan's best work."
m/37_seconds," A remarkably frank and surprisingly warm depiction of disability, care-giving and sexuality."
m/3_2011, Rarely gets deep enough under [its characters'] skin to make them seem like more than devices in a socio-political thesis.
m/3_2_1_frankie_go_boom," Though riddled with credibility-straining coincidences and over-the-top humiliation, Jordan Roberts' Frankie Go Boom plays out with more charm than desperation."
m/3_4x_juugatsu," Tranquility explodes into violence, which recedes to its original serenity -- an effect achieved by crosscuts and juxtapositions that take on a manic-depressive lyricism."
m/3_days_to_kill," 3 Days to Kill is entertaining enough, ironically, for those with some time to kill."
m/3_from_hell, Rob Zombie gives fans exactly what they want in this brutally offensive finale.
m/3_generations, It's frustrating how uneven and cutesy the movie ends up being.
m/3_hearts," Those willing to invest in the lives of these characters, even if the framework around them directly and without apology guides them toward inevitable tragedy, they will experience a drama of deep, genuine feeling."
m/3_holes_and_a_smoking_gun, Actor James Wilder excels as a washed up screenwriter in this fascinating psychological thriller. He takes charge of the screen and never lets go.
m/3_idiots, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows.
m/3_iron, An oddly funny love story about dispossessed soul-mates who ultimately unlock each other's hearts.
m/3_nights_in_the_desert_2014, ...3 Nights in the Desert is a thoroughly unpleasant homecoming of three friends getting the band back together...
m/3_ninjas," For me, 3 Ninjas had its amusing moments but was also tedious at times."
m/3_ninjas_high_noon_at_mega_mountain," Abrasively loud, gratingly acted, appallingly directed and without a moral core, this ""3 Ninjas"" also boasts a screenplay with the most ""Unhhhs"" of the decade, that exquisite sound you make when trying to anihilate another human with your foot or a karate"
m/3_ninjas_kick_back," Filled with martial-arts action, bathroom humor, and slapstick, 3 Ninjas Kick Back even has a politically correct kicker: The champion ninja is a girl."
m/3_women," Robert Altman's would-be American art film (1977) is murky, snide, and sloppy."
m/400_blows, Léaud's performance is a marvel in the way he conveys Antoine's frustration with the world around him and the inability of adults to understand him.
m/40_days_and_40_nights, ...delightfully surprising freshness and soul where all the hackneyed conventions usually are.
m/40_year_old_virgin," Sticking to one joke in an unconscionably long film makes for a very stale, witless and repetitive comedy."
m/420_massacre, It's boring enough while sober; only the heroic could stay focused on this film while high.
m/42_2013," The film elevates the story of Jackie Robinson to that of cornball legend rather than just honoring his legitimately uplifting, heroic saga by telling it straight."
m/42nd_street, Busby Berkeley's astonishing choreography is singularly cinematic and still astonishing.
m/4321," This is energetic, pulpy exploitation from the UK that might just claim back a small corner of the multiplex audience from the relentless onslaught of cynical Hollywood garbage. And for that at least, 4.3.2.1 can't be dismissed as all bad. Just mostly."
m/444_last_day_on_earth_2012, Lower East Side lights go out for the last time in this creepy anti-sci-fi thriller.
m/44_inch_chest," Could easily elicit accusations of misogyny -- especially given its percussive, unrelenting but eminently realistic use of the C-word -- but it's actually, at its best, an acute, unblinking portrait of misogyny in practice, not a misogynistic text itself."
m/45_years," As was the case with his debut feature, Weekend, Haigh works in a familiar slow-burn mode, one in which high drama and extravagant visual invention is generally suppressed in favor of close observation of human behavior."
m/47_meters_down," If you are a fan of shark flicks, this is a must see and one that will leave you gasping for air."
m/47_meters_down_uncaged, Focuses on maintaining the viewer's tension at all times. [Full review in Spanish]
m/47_ronin_2013," As the old adage goes, you can't polish a turd. But you can sprinkle plenty of CGI and countless close-ups of Keanu Reeves looking morose onto it."
m/48_hrs," The movie's story is nothing to write home about. It's pretty routine. What makes the movie special is how it's made. Nolte and Murphy are good, and their dialogue is good, too -- quirky and funny."
m/49th_parallel," While it might not seem so on the surface to those weaned on Why We Fight and, conversely, The Eternal Jew, 49th Parallel is wholly valid as propaganda."
m/4_2006," In spite of a handful of striking images, 4 never resolves into anything special."
m/4_days_in_france_2017," If nothing else, Reybaud's debut flaunts his knack for casting, particularly with the lead performance by Pascal Cervo."
m/4_little_girls," A thoughtful, graceful, quietly devastating account."
m/4_minute_mile," More than one interior scene looks underlit for effect,but that's at least something else to think about as the film goes through its paces."
m/4_months_3_weeks_and_2_days," Can be looked upon as an anti-Communist tract and an implied statement about abortion, but far more important, this is an incisive film about two vulnerable people at the mercy of a cynical abortionist and an underground economy."
m/500_days_of_summer," Offbeat and original, Marc Webb's feature debut is a charming serio comedy that views love and romance from a strictly male POV, reversing both Hollywood and societal norms."
m/5050_2011," Even hardened cynics will embrace the clich -- yep, you will laugh, you will cry."
m/50_first_dates, The Farrellys use the grotesque to illuminate human frailty while filmmakers like Peter Segal stoop low in order to validate their characters.
m/50_to_1," Wilson has owned and raced horses for years and once had a 190-acre ranch in California. And he has made the kind of film he might have seen as a kid, one where patience and hard work get rewarded at the 11th hour."
m/51_birch_street," It's a loving, painful map of the gulf between thought and word, between word and deed, that props up good marriages, and sends bad ones to hell."
m/52_tuesdays, Sophie Hyde barely elaborates on the toll James's transition takes on him and only superficially as it affects Billie's psyche.
m/54, The plotting and pacing are so relentlessly predictable that the film doesn't even work well as a sociology lesson.
m/55_steps," Considering the ramifications of its true-life story, this earnest legal melodrama about fighting the system never achieves the necessary urgency or poignancy."
m/56_up, For those of us already fans of the series and invested in the characters over the course of seven films and 42 years it's a necessary continuation and curiosity.
m/5_broken_cameras_2012, A truly powerful statement on the horrors of occupation and the heart of the resistance to it.
m/5_children_and_it, Five posh First World War sprogs are despatched to Uncle Kenneth Branagh's Gothic pile in a Devon nook. It's a ghastly film
m/5_days_of_war, I think this is sort of quite an impressive film and it just sort of makes you angry all over again about this sort of unfairness of the politics in the world.
m/5_flights_up, Failing to measure up to heartbreaking classics about the aged pushed out of their homes by the new - Leo McCarey's Make Way For Tomorrow (1937)and Vittorio de Sica's Umberto D (1952) - Ruth & Alex is mostly real estate lite.
m/5_to_7, It's as much a triumph of boyish wish fulfillment as Peter Parker swinging on skyscrapers.
m/600_miles," Ripstein allows events to unfold in a meandering low-key style, employing an observational point-of-view with a handheld camera."
m/61," Barry Pepper is an amazing Maris look-alike, Thomas Jane manages to suggest the damage Mantle did to himself, and Richard Masur plays the sort of sportswriter I wanted to grow up to be..."
m/68_kill," This bona-fide grindhouse film constantly goes for violent and gory shock value, yet manages to connect more through its hilarious female characters."
m/6_balloons," What stays with you is [Abbi] Jacobson's grippingly understated lead turn, which promises a fruitful future screen life beyond Broad City."
m/6_below_miracle_on_the_mountain," The elephant in the room with 6 Below: Miracle on the Mountain is that it is a cheaply made, religious anti-drug movie masquerading as a standard Hollywood film."
m/6_souls," All too often [the film] borrows from the ideas and conventions of the pysch-horror without giving either them, or the audience, enough respect for it to work."
m/6_underground," It becomes repetitive, nonsensical, and just loud after everyone gets an origin story and we're left with nothing to do but go boom."
m/6_ways_to_die," What could have been a smartly executed revenge drama gets thrown on its side in the last two minutes with an unnecessary, cringe-worthy twist ending..."
m/6_years_2015," There is enough in 6 Years from Farmiga and Rosenfield's performances to warrant a watch, and Fidell's ideas and subtle developments around such a challenging story are heartfelt and mostly well-rendered."
m/6ixtynin9," This is a competently made film, with some wonderfully subdued camera work and very effective editing."
m/71_2015, There is certainly enough about this young filmmaker to suggest a bright career beckons.
m/71_fragments_of_a_chronology_of_chance," The film's Endsville, when we reach it, is almost an anticlimax, thanks to the masterfully orchestrated ensemble acting and the countless dramatic mini-explosions unleashed along the way."
m/7852_hitchcocks_shower_scene, Philippe's tribute to Hollywood's most famous stabbing is an archival feast.
m/7_boxes," The film is ripe with powerful subtext, specifically how greed, celebrity, and technology help to form a misguided sense of opportunity that keeps the working class downtrodden."
m/7_chinese_brothers," Rarely has Schwartzman played a role that is so without affectation, nor has he embarked on a true love from this oblique an angle. Blame (i.e. praise) Byington for keeping the proceedings exceptionally honest while never stinting on the inherent comedy."
m/7_days_in_entebbe," Although much of the film is effectively claustrophobic, it is too bogged down by exposition to fully take off."
m/7_guardians_of_the_tomb," Rendall can only do so much with the limited budget and thespian talents gathered, leaving ""7 Guardians of the Tomb"" straining to be the high-flying good time at the movies it wants to become."
m/8-12," Its opening [has] perhaps the greatest dream scene of all: Marcello Mastroianni's Guido stifled in a silent traffic jam, onlookers gazing blankly at him as he rises through the sunroof of his car, high into the sky. The rest of the film isn't too shabby."
m/8-the-mormon-proposition, The Mormon Proposition is about as subjective as documentaries get. The good news is that Cowan and Greenstreet are compelling enough to convince you that only one side of this debate deserves a voice.
m/84_charing_cross_road," The film has nothing to do with easy nostalgia; it's about real, credible people, and as such finally becomes very moving."
m/88_minutes," Even Zinnemann (High Noon) and Badham (Nick of Time) knew that to heighten suspense of a story spanning real time, the film's running-time must be the same or close, but Avnet and scripter unnecessarily extend their inane saga from 88 to 106 minutes."
m/8_heads_in_a_duffel_bag," Not really a gangster film, not really a romantic comedy, just a mishmash of lame set-pieces and never seem to jell into anything coherent."
m/8_mile," In the singers-who-can't-act sweepstakes, Britney Spears (Crossroads) is still on top, edging out Eminem, who is about on par with Mariah Carey (Glitter)."
m/8_seconds, The title implies how long you'll be able to sit through it.
m/8mm, Director Joel Schumacher steadily turns on the tension.
m/90_minutes_in_heaven," Rendering a miraculous premise dull, the film seems relatively uninterested in doing more than preaching to the choir."
m/911_2017," ""9/11"" just...exists for 90 minutes, offering no insight or emotionality, quickly graduating from curious to forgettable as the inevitable closes in."
m/95-miles-to-go," could have been an absolute stunner of fame-induced paranoia, but it's happy where it is"
m/9500-liberty, The release of the new documentary 9500 Liberty couldn't be more timely.
m/976_evil," An unsual combination of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" meets ""The Lawnmower Man"""
m/999_2008, A modest but undeniably charming under-the-radar surprise.
m/99_homes, 99 Homes proves that [Ramin Bahrani] can make thrillingly urgent mainstream entertainment without turning his back on the harsh realities of life on the breadline.
m/9_12_weeks, It's an Adrian Lyne picture. Do you need to know more?
m/9_dead_gay_guys, It would have been nice if there were more bite than bark.
m/9_full_moons_2013," Despite the initial promise, though, the more we get to see of Lev and Frankie's unlikely romance and chaotic lives, the less original it seems."
m/9_to_5, 9 to 5 works as a wish-fulfillment satire on male chauvinism.
m/The-Rum-Diary," Charming though the majority of the film may be, for a story about a man finding his voice, this one eventually loses its nerve."
m/a-crude-awakening-the-oil-crash," As the puzzle interlocks, the composite truth is terrifying. A second horseman of social collapse is pounding towards us--peak oil."
m/a-film-with-me-in-it," The epilogue leaves you feeling hollow and empty, but as a less-than-satisfying film concludes, you may also realise that this is entirely the point."
m/a-good-old-fashioned-orgy," Jason Sudeikis completes his 2011 dude-comedy trilogy with A Good Old Fashioned Orgy, a genial film of good old-fashioned humorlessness."
m/a-little-help," The film apparently intends to be a dramedy, but with next to no humor materializing, the story quickly bogs down into earnest indie bathos."
m/a-mothers-courage-talking-back-to-autism, Appealing documentary about autism is hurt by some aspects of its storytelling.
m/a-necessary-death," As much as it doesn't seem like you're watching an intricate plot unfold, there's actually so much going on -- all of it layered; structured brilliantly."
m/a-rumor-of-angels," What's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast, but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism."
m/a-small-act," Heartening as small acts are, the bigger issues here demand a more rigorous address."
m/a-troll-in-central-park," While sitting in thrall of it, it's only natural for the abused mind to scramble to find reason in an otherwise meaningless entertainment."
m/a-wedding-for-bella," After sampling the crostini and extended-family love baked by the Brothers Pyzola, you might make the Biscotti Co. a second home."
m/a-wink-and-a-smile," In Deirdre Allen Timmons' A Wink and a Smile, she delves into the making of a sexy performer by infiltrating Miss Indigo Blue's Academy of Burlesque in Seattle."
m/a_bad_moms_christmas," Although it offers occasional chuckles and even a few solid, laugh-out-loud moments, the picture as a whole seems redundant and superfluous."
m/a_bag_of_hammers," Suffers from both an odd, ineffective structure and a low-key tone that jars uncomfortably with the subject matter and makes the film's stakes seem unnecessary low."
m/a_band_called_death_2013," A new wrinkle on Andy Warhol's maxim: Eventually, every undiscovered band will receive its own righteous documentary, lapped up by a bin-trawling audience (and a festival circuit ready to serve them)."
m/a_better_life," Despite Demian Bichir's affecting lead performance and a strong feel for Los Angeles' Mexican-American communities, [the film] emerges an earnest and overly programmatic heart-tugger."
m/a_bigger_splash_2016," The film has much to offer, primarily Ralph Fiennes, who could walk away with a prize for his dazzling bravura turn."
m/a_bird_of_the_air," Unfortunately, the film itself never quite feeds off the quirkiness or the energy, and so it remains a pleasant but not a profound film."
m/a_birders_guide_to_everything_2013, A Birder's Guide to Everything should be standard issue for anyone looking to relearn the importance of a flock.
m/a_bottle_in_the_gaza_sea," The film obviously can't resolve the conflict between Palestine and Israel, but the resolution to the story's arc feels nonetheless forced and misplaced."
m/a_boy_called_po," Well-meaning but, on the whole, intensely inert ..."
m/a_boy_called_sailboat," A Boy Called Sailboat is made with passion by very talented people. It's whimsical, slightly magical tale is a joy to watch, and the sweet-natured atmosphere is going to delight viewers for years to come."
m/a_bread_factory_part_one_for_the_sake_of_gold," Experiences such as this, that offer such a wealth of intellect and warmth so persistently, are few and far between."
m/a_bread_factory_part_two_walk_with_me_a_while," Taken together with Part One, it seems as thorough and thoughtful a statement on art and life as any American filmmaker has given us."
m/a_breath_away," Well made and engrossing on a smaller, more personal scale than we're used to from stories like this."
m/a_brighter_summer_day_1991," Here, Yang has erected a temporal experience, a completely immersive world that few artists in any medium could ever hope to do. If you love cinema, you'll love this movie. That's a promise."
m/a_brilliant_young_mind," This British tale of the difficulties of adolescence and adulthood is a sweet rather than saccharine tale, quietly told and lent emotional heft by a cast led by Asa Butterfield."
m/a_brony_tale," Some of its subjects definitely register high on a creepy meter, but the film does provide an interesting look at our expectations of manliness, gender norms and comments on sexuality."
m/a_brothers_kiss," Since what happens to the characters as adults is more or less preordained, what makes the movie work is the conviction of the performances."
m/a_burning_hot_summer," This existential-romantic roundelay barely simmers, and certainly doesn't scorch."
m/a_canterbury_tale_1949," Though infuriatingly difficult to categorise, the film is bold, inventive, stimulating and extremely entertaining."
m/a_case_of_you," Wood makes Birdie approachable enough that Sam's continuing treatment of her as a fantasy-girl, who could only like a fictionalized version of him, grows tiresome as the film progresses."
m/a_cat_in_paris," A charming little French animation (not suitable for very young children,) directed by Alain Gagnol and Jean-Loup Felicioli..."
m/a_christmas_prince, So bad it's good? No. It's so bad it's just plain bad. Did I enjoy it? No. Would I watch it again? Definitely not.
m/a_christmas_prince_the_royal_baby," More than any previous Netflix Christmas film, A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby is pure escapism."
m/a_christmas_prince_the_royal_wedding," ""The Royal Wedding"" is an addictive movie that will make you cancel your social life, because you must watch it every single night for two weeks."
m/a_ciambra," Jonas Carpignano constructs a telling story with minimal elements, and extracts an astonishing truth from the actors. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/a_coffee_in_berlin," Wryly acted and beautifully shot, Oh Boy is a delight from start to finish."
m/a_conspiracy_of_faith_2016," ""A Conspiracy of Faith"" marks the darkest and most gripping screen adaptation of the Jussi Adler-Olsen novels to date."
m/a_cop, Mr. Melville's obsession with technical information is sometimes taken to lengths that border on the crazy.
m/a_country_called_home," While I found it sincere, I felt like it meandered too much and suffered from anxiety over what kind of a film it wanted to be."
m/a_crooked_somebody, Sharp performances make this knotty thriller about a psychic who has to lie to his life sing.
m/a_cure_for_wellness," It spends at least 90 minutes thinking it's feeding you a mystery that you've already solved. I almost feel bad for the movie. It really wanted to be a big twist so badly, it's just sad."
m/a_dangerous_method," It's Knightley that one remembers, for a full-on portrayal that is gutsy and potentially divisive in equal parts."
m/a_dark_song," Positioning itself firmly at the arthouse end of horror, A Dark Song is a credible exploration of a desperately dysfunctional relationship."
m/a_dark_truth," An interesting baby step toward a larger discussion of the water rights issue, but there's not enough integrity here to savor, with all the violence and cliche drowning out the lasting message of the movie."
m/a_date_with_judy," Taylor is breathtakingly beautiful, but Miranda walks off with every scene she's in."
m/a_deriva," This is a mature and thoughtful drama that absorbs the viewer into the world of the family, and leaves you as emotionally bruised and drained as the characters themselves."
m/a_dogs_journey," This is hardly one for the cynics. It's a big, wet, sloppy lick of a film that's going to jerk your tears, and then some."
m/a_dogs_purpose, That's what you get from A Dog's Purpose: emotional torture porn of the canine variety. Its sole purpose is cheap emotional manipulation.
m/a_dogs_way_home," I laughed and I cried and I said, ""Aww,"" and that is not a bad way to begin the year."
m/a_fantastic_fear_of_everything, Things only pick up in the final reel with Alan Drakes's 80s rock fan and community police officer given full rein to deliver the best jokes so far. But it's too late.
m/a_fantastic_woman," With a remarkable performance by Daniela Vega, the film is a drama with suspense elements about the different forms that gender violence can take. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/a_farewell_to_fools," Call it a dark farce, human comedy or wartime satire. But however you slice it, the ill-conceived morality tale ""A Farewell to Fools"" is a bust."
m/a_few_best_men, Olivia Newton John is an absolute hoot as mother in law Barbara in this madcap romantic comedy that brings together English and Australian humour in earthy earnest.
m/a_field_in_england," Ben Wheatley's strangest movie yet: mysticism, mystification and magic mushrooms in a English Civil War setting. Often confusing, occasionally infuriating - but audaciously original."
m/a_fierce_green_fire," There's no consistent narrative thread to carry the film from start to finish, and A Fierce Green Fire fails to open any singular intellectual or psychological point of investigation."
m/a_five_star_life," So slow-moving, the narrative takes forever to gain momentum, and when it finally does, it deliberately undercuts it."
m/a_fond_kiss," Consummate recorders of the grit-and-grime struggle of the underclasses, Loach and collaborator Paul Laverty employ rapid-fire dialogue (rendered ear-poppingly undecipherable in Scots accents) in disheveled and very real family settings."
m/a_four_letter_word, A Four Letter Word is a surprisingly endearing romantic comedy that explores gay relationships with low-budget verve.
m/a_futile_and_stupid_gesture," ""Futile"" lies haphazardly between funny and not, as comedies about comedy tend to do."
m/a_ghost_story," ""Absolutely mesmerizing, with an anything-goes quality that's endlessly fascinating."""
m/a_girl_and_a_gun_2012," Touches on women packing heat lately, and why. And what it all has to do with economic privilege and economic insecurity; J. Edgar Hoover; fetishizing violent women in Hollywood; Democrats; and crotchless boutique female huntress wear as all the rage."
m/a_girl_walks_home_alone_at_night, This moody and gorgeous film is finally more about atmosphere and emotions than narrative -- and none the worse for it.
m/a_glimpse_inside_the_mind_of_charles_swan_iii, There's probably a really fresh and fun movie a rewrite or edit away. It's just not here.
m/a_good_day_to_die_hard," The noisiest, silliest, and lousiest entry in the action franchise that began 25 years ago."
m/a_good_woman_is_hard_to_find," Not only do director Pastoll and writer Blaney deliver a solid vengeance thriller, but ... [they] manage to craft a strong female lead and a script that has a self-awareness in regards to how society, especially men, look at less-advantaged women."
m/a_gray_state," A Gray State slowly peels back the curtain on David's private life to reveal an increasingly unstable individual, one whose suspicions about institutional systems quickly blossomed into distrust of everything and everyone around him."
m/a_great_wall," A Great Wall is about the sort of visit I imagine most of us would like to make, back to the people and the ways of life where we, or our ancestors, came from."
m/a_guide_to_recognizing_your_saints," After a while, the crudeness and venality of the central characters proves as stifling as the incessant Queens summer heat does to our dubious protagonists."
m/a_guy_thing, There has to be something offensive about a movie this aggressively bland.
m/a_hard_day," ...its cheerfully nutso inventiveness, the ballsy cycling of ramped-up tension with cathartic release, and not least the many belly laughs it elicited has us feeling completely renewed."
m/a_haunted_house," Mean-spirited, badly made and unfunny is one set of disasters; adding in storytelling incompetence adds to the catastrophe."
m/a_haunted_house_2," Calling this one an improvement is like saying that being kicked in the shin is better than being punched in the stomach. Either way, it hurts."
m/a_hijacking," When the credits roll, you may feel as if you too have been released from captivity."
m/a_hologram_for_the_king," 'A Hologram for a King' is that fine and rare thing, a comedy that makes profound observations with the lightest of touches."
m/a_jihad_for_love, A much-needed reminder that the foundation for any great religion is love and tolerance.
m/a_kid_like_jake," ""A Kid Like Jake"" might not be especially cinematic, but it is profound in its simplicity and truthfulness about what real fights sound like and what real lives look like."
m/a_kind_of_murder," Good source material does not guarantee a good movie, and A Kind of Murder, a new Highsmith adaptation directed by Andy Goddard from a screenplay by Susan Boyd, is not a good movie."
m/a_la_mala," The thing is that this is not really a movie, it's just one of the biggest adds in movie history. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/a_late_quartet," Ultimately, while the performances are very good, the script could have stood a little more restraint."
m/a_league_of_ordinary_gentlemen," I know what you're thinking... a documentary about bowling? To which I answer: Hell yeah, and a darn good one, too!"
m/a_letter_to_momo," Although the film may lack the charm found in similar offerings, it pulls genuine emotional punches that only enhance its sense of wonder."
m/a_liars_autobiography_the_untrue_story_of_monty_pythons_graham_chapman," A must see for Python disciples, this extensively produced 3D string of animations will run hot and cold with the general public."
m/a_little_bit_of_heaven_2011, [A] painfully protracted mix of doomed love and mild toilet humour...
m/a_little_chaos," This decently acted film is agreeable entertainment, even if it works better on a scene by scene basis than in terms of overall flow."
m/a_little_trip_to_heaven, The pacing makes you feel like you're trudging through the snow.
m/a_lonely_place_to_die_2011," Bounding o'er hill and dale, this energetic chase thriller barely pauses for plausibility, pitting climbers against kidnappers in the Scottish Highlands."
m/a_long_way_down," Trivialising despair, it's a depressing waste of a major cast, and an early bid for mess of the year."
m/a_long_way_from_home," What seems at first an almost mundane affair becomes a devastating, unsentimental portrait of quiet desperation"
m/a_man_and_a_woman, an interesting piece of film history... that's lost much of its luster
m/a_man_called_ove," It's emotionally manipulative, but its two leads find a core of humanity even in the most calculating plot machinations."
m/a_man_escaped, This film manages to look at an episode in one man's life without it being overshadowed by either the mechanics of filmmaking or the machinations of politics.
m/a_man_named_pearl, Pic looks very much like a protracted man-of-the-week spot on a local newscast.
m/a_mans_story_2011, It may not cut as deeply as you might have hoped but fashionistas will be fascinated.
m/a_master_builder," Enthralling deflation of archetypal egotistical artist, with delicious irony from his perspective. . .Urgent hand-held intimacy, 360-degree close-ups dispense stagey feel."
m/a_merry_friggin_christmas," Instead of bringing together a fractured family, the movie stays diffuse."
m/a_midsummer_nights_dream_2014," Taymor's ""Dream"" is, in Bottom's words, a most rare vision. It flickers before us almost too quickly, passing by ""swift as a shadow, short as any dream."""
m/a_million_little_pieces," Who is this movie for? Beyond the couple who made it, I have no idea."
m/a_million_ways_to_die_in_the_west," It could have been funnier and some of the sheep penis jokes could have been circumcised, but there is an appealing cumulative effect to the nonsense"
m/a_monster_calls," There's a truly monstrous film lurking in here somewhere, but Bayona seems hell-bent on keeping it at bay."
m/a_monster_in_paris," Beautifully animated with impressive background work, likeable characters and a couple of catchy songs, this is an enjoyable and frequently charming family adventure that should appeal to both adults and children..."
m/a_month_of_sundays_2015, ...one can only hope that this marks a temporary stumble for an otherwise talented filmmaker.
m/a_most_violent_year," With his third feature, writer-director J.C. Chandor continues to cement a reputation for making distinctive, intelligent films of which no two are alike."
m/a_most_wanted_man, Strangely uneven but Philip Seymour Hoffman is a le Carre natural.
m/a_murder_in_the_park," ...laid out almost like a prosecutor's opening argument, with charts, a crisply delivered timeline, a gallery of villains and nafs, and a jaw-dropping story of corruption and thwarted justice."
m/a_nagy_fuzet_2013, This cautionary tale certainly has a chilling and timely message of how wars make monsters out of innocent people.
m/a_nice_girl_like_you," This movie is just light as a feather, but that's okay because it's also funny and cute."
m/a_night_in_old_mexico," The movie doesn't have the same kind of emotional depth that Duvall and Wittliff managed to pull off decades ago. Worse, the dialogue often sounds stilted."
m/a_nightmare_on_elm_street_2_freddys_revenge," Although Jesse and Lisa are granted some much-needed time to get it on, he and the film would appear in unison in that they're still waiting to come out of the closet."
m/a_nightmare_on_elm_street_3_dream_warriors, Parts of it work extraordinarily well for a horror film of this vintage. And parts of it don't particularly work at all.
m/a_nightmare_on_elm_street_4_the_dream_master, A good sequel in the series directed by trash auteur Renny Harlin with just the right flair.
m/a_nightmare_on_elm_street_5_the_dream_child," Even horror movies need some kind of rules to go by -- but Nightmare 5 is all over the map, little more than a bizarre free-for-all. It is confusing and dumb."
m/a_novel_romance," The film looks good, at least. But look past that, and there's not much there."
m/a_perfect_day," Inconsistency is A Perfect Day's biggest problem. The script is scalpel sharp in some places, flabby as the well-blocker in others."
m/a_perfect_getaway," Smug? Damn, this is a self-satisfied, arrogant excuse for a film, in which the red-herringness is piled on with outrageous aplomb till there can be no doubt that Twohy is daring you to guess what's up and hoping you're not up to it, or not caring if you a"
m/a_place_at_the_table_2013," More difficult to convey are the web of moral and political issues that surround the hunger crisis, and A Place at the Table proves its worth most by how it treats this wider set of problems."
m/a_plumm_summer, Feels like an homage to a bygone era of moviemaking.
m/a_poem_is_a_naked_person, Those familiar with Les Blank's malleable approach to documentary production will recognize that energy in its nascent form.
m/a_prayer_before_dawn," Like any mean prizefighter, it's admirable from afar."
m/a_private_war," An incredibly sophisticated, psychologically immersive film..."
m/a_promise_2013," Patrice Leconte struggles to find a coherent rhythm, a problem exacerbated by a hurried running time that compresses some of the novella's more interesting socio-political nuances."
m/a_quiet_passion, What sets the film drastically off-balance is its contrastingly finicky impulse to paint Dickinson as one of the rapier wits of her generation.
m/a_quiet_place_2018," [John Krasinski] has crafted a movie that demands to be seen on the big screen, with an audience as terrified as you."
m/a_reindeers_journey," Sutherland adopts the tone of a kindly grandpa reindeer, or perhaps God himself, looking down from a drone's eye view. For younger kids, it might well work. For anyone over age 12, it will probably sound a little patronising."
m/a_room_with_a_view_1985," James Ivory directs this gentle, poetic, comic film with grace and passion for its characters in this adaptation of the E.M. Forster novel."
m/a_royal_night_out, This cheerful farce often feels scaled down for Sunday-night TV.
m/a_score_to_settle, Ku... struggles to match his star's surrender to a story that seems to have little idea where it's going.
m/a_screaming_man," [Director] Haroun fails to lift his universal fable to the height of an epic, whatever its budget."
m/a_secret_love," At once a misty-eyed romance and a harsh depiction of the practical and emotional challenges of giving up independent living, ""A Secret Love"" isn't subtle in its Kleenex-clutching tactics... but it's certainly effective."
m/a_separation_2011," Impressively shot and acted, A Separation refuses to judge its characters: everyone here has their reasons."
m/a_serious_man," Extremely clever, another piece of truly original fiction storytelling from the Coens, showing their brilliance at delivering subtle realism while keeping audiences entertained."
m/a_shaun_the_sheep_movie_farmageddon," Farmageddon happily retains the inventive action of the early classic shorts, and there is more than enough in the frame to hold the attention throughout."
m/a_short_history_of_decay, The film flourishes when it moves away from a coming-of-age story to a more family ensemble piece.
m/a_simple_favor, Paul Feig makes a slight gear change for a slick thriller that's best enjoyed with a martini in hand.
m/a_simple_life_2011," A Simple Life is moving and well made, but it could use a little emotional grit and, while we're at it, a sense of humor."
m/a_simple_wedding, The movie consistently rights itself and ends up being very enjoyable. Simple Wedding's cleverness is it's best asset and Zandieh has delivered a truly unique picture.
m/a_single_girl_2000, Jacquot finds unexpected and intriguing drama in the daily routine of a contemporary young woman.
m/a_single_shot, David Rosenthal's follow-up to Janie Jones is in the end too shot through with genre clich to prevail as the gritty thriller that it is striving to be.
m/a_sinner_in_mecca," A Sinner in Mecca is a suitably messy mix of the gritty and the surreal, the wrenching and the transcendent, from the midst of the trek to Islam's holiest site."
m/a_skin_so_soft, Côté's humane fascination with six bodybuilders tosses aside grandstanding and focuses on the odd duality of man and muscle.
m/a_slipping_down_life, Too trite and uninteresting to service the wonderfully affecting performance from Lili Taylor.
m/a_smile_like_yours," Writer-director Keith Samples has pieced together scraps of bad sperm jokes, an inane 'rags-to-riches' story line, and a boring extra-marital affair for 'intrigue.'"
m/a_song_for_martin," A wrenching film about a romance between two people in their fifties, shattered when one becomes the victim of Alzheimer's disease."
m/a_space_program," Neistat stays true to his subject's oddball sensibility, right down to the hand-lettered credits that crank slowly across the screen after the mission's end."
m/a_star_is_born_2018," Credit to Cooper for delivering his best, most soulful performance while pulling double duty behind the camera, but it's his co-star whose magnetism most draws you into their world - and keeps you there even when the film hits the occasional wrong note."
m/a_street_cat_named_bob," What works on the page seems slight on screen. That's not to say it isn't life-affirming, it's just not quite the cat's pyjamas."
m/a_suitable_girl," While this triptych portrait of three modern Indian women who have decided, for various reasons, to wed in this way provides some insights, it feels like a tiny chink into a vast and complex subject"
m/a_summer_in_genoa, Slow pace dilutes the few moments of tension. A genre should have been picked and stuck with.
m/a_sun_2019, As wrenching and resonant a cinematic experience as can be found in any country this year...
m/a_tale_of_love_and_darkness, Portman adores Oz's book and its characters so much that she never quite digs deeply enough to bring them to life.
m/a_tale_of_two_sisters, Unnervingly conflates fairytale lore with the angst of adolescent sexual development.
m/a_teacher_2013," Fidell still surprises with the direction of her film, and as honest as it is, as true as it feels, A Teacher still packs a punch."
m/a_team," It's temping to say that you're better off not thinking about the plot and how tenuously it all holds together. The truth is, you're better off not thinking at all."
m/a_thousand_kisses_deep, Slick and ambitious but also soapy and unfulfilling.
m/a_thousand_words," If only this Eddie Murphy flick had taken its own advice and spent a little more time being reflective instead of hyperactive, it might have overcome a trite script and awful, obvious excuses for comedy."
m/a_thousand_years_of_good_prayers, Wang fails to integrate the philosophy of Li's fiction into the action of the story.
m/a_touch_of_sin, It's travelogue cinema for the dissolute and gravely disenfranchised.
m/a_town_called_panic," There are more sophisticated animated films out there, but none with the sheer joie de vivre that this Belgian stop-motion-animation entry packs into 75 rollicking minutes."
m/a_tuba_to_cuba, A worthwhile journey for New Orleans and Caribbean music buffs and music buffs in general.
m/a_turtles_tale_sammys_adventures," With endless shots of underwater landscapes propping up an episodic narrative, this is less Finding Nemo than one long screensaver."
m/a_united_kingdom, The wonderful performances merely prove part of a serviceable historical drama with a desire it can't quite fulfill of being more.
m/a_very_british_gangster_2008," A Very British Gangster is a very watchable movie, one that explores an oft-exploited mob milieu and busts some of its fictional bubbles. These are troubling people, to be sure, but MacIntyre makes them human, as well as frightening."
m/a_very_long_engagement_2004," I enjoyed the film immensely, but felt it could have been one of 2004's best if 15 or so minutes had been carefully cobbled out of it."
m/a_very_sordid_wedding," There's something touching about Shores' hope that a town like Winters can change colors like the streaks of eye shadow that cake his characters' faces, but his impulse toward Southern-fried cartoonishness cheapens and undermines it."
m/a_vigilante," Wilde turns in one of the best performances of her career, providing a reason to remain with Sara Dagger-Nickson's screenplay, which veers from an unnerving understanding of true fear to something close to wish-fulfillment."
m/a_violent_man, An MMA fighter murder mystery that never makes much of the mystery.
m/a_violent_separation," A promising B-movie thriller the filmmakers can never quite bring themselves to edit into this slow, cluttered picture into the lean little neo-noir it wants to be."
m/a_wake_in_providence, A film for those people who think My Big Fat Greek Wedding is the greatest comedy of the past ten years
m/a_walk_among_the_tombstones," With references to Philip Marlowe and discussion of what it takes to make a good detective it's clear Frank intends Scudder to become a household name but, given this dodgy effort, that may never happen."
m/a_walk_in_the_woods_2015," It's pleasant enough cinematic comfort food, but even so, you may be hungry again soon afterward."
m/a_walk_into_the_sea_danny_williams_and_the_warhol_factory," The result of the interviews is the most vivid, and perhaps most damning, portrait of Warhol seen on film."
m/a_war," It's an intense and at times harrowing drama, tautly written and directed, and brilliantly acted."
m/a_warriors_heart, A ho-hum drama whose many moving parts feel decidedly recycled.
m/a_whale_of_a_tale_2018," ""A Whale of a Tale"" is a rambling blend of complaint, tourism and straw-men arguments. What it's not is persuasive."
m/a_white_white_day," It's a tough experience, for both the audience watching and the characters within, but Palmason's rugged deconstruction of traditional male masculinity is a struggle worth sitting through."
m/a_will_for_the_woods," n the film's sobering final act, we get to see the man's beliefs put to practice...fulfill[ing] his wishes--including using this film to share his philosophy with the world."
m/a_wolf_at_the_door, It finds its strength in painting a portrait of Brazilian heterosexual gender relations as an always-volatile symbiosis between feminine hysteria and ruthless machismo.
m/a_woman_a_gun_and_a_noodle_shop," Those with a higher tolerance for bumptious jestering -- from a yipping and mincing Xiao, or Cheng Ye as a bucktoothed jelly-belly -- may, however, cry Masterpiece."
m/a_woman_is_a_woman," Jean-Luc Godard's A Woman is A Woman, along with his great My Life to Live, remains one of the director's more accessible works."
m/a_woman_of_paris_a_drama_of_fate," An important milestone in Chaplin's career, this simple melodrama overcomes the limits of its story to offer a fascinating example of the writer-director's understanding of the constraints of cinematic form."
m/a_wrinkle_in_time_2018," A Wrinkle in Time is a sappy melodrama, devoid of mystery or wonder. Director Ava DuVernay beats positivity in with a sledgehammer."
m/aarakshan, ...focuses more on issues than the spectacular musical sequences for which Bollywood movies are famous.
m/aardvark_2018," The sort of movie that gets by with its unpredictable where-is-this-going vibe for about a half-hour or so, but it becomes apparent at a certain point that the set-up is pretty much all there is."
m/ab_normal_beauty," Whether a moody thriller or a twisted head-trip, Ab-normal Beauty is an exquisitely disorienting portrait of an artist as a troubled soul - beautiful, bloody and rather bewildering."
m/abandon," In burying elements of behavioral psychology below a dozen different shades of blue, Gaghan draws attention away from the fact that there's a trick pony at play here."
m/abandoned, Eerie frights here are more a matter of sheer dread-soaked atmosphere.
m/abattoir," Bousman might not quite pull off the 'Howard Hawks meets The Wicker Man' vibe he's going for, but Abattoir is horror for grown-ups"
m/abbott_and_costello," Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein shows off both the comedy team and the monsters at their best, ranking in my book with Ghostbusters as one of the best horror-comedies ever."
m/abbott_and_costello_meet_dr_jekyll_and_mr_hyde, Passable Abbott and Costello entry with + of Karloff.
m/abbott_and_costello_meet_the_mummy," Probably no worse than the usual Abbott and Costello comedies in the long running series, it just seems worse."
m/abcs_of_death_2," The ABCs Of Death 2 has something for the deviant in all of us, assembling another winning collection boasting sick, twisted, psychotic fun."
m/abduction_2011," Last I checked, tweenage girls weren't too keen on this genre, and the boys who normally would be a fan will likely be disappointed by [Abduction's] bloodless, stagnant lameness."
m/abe_2020, This one was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I loved everything with Abe...but the adults in the family left something to be desired...But in the end Abe is a strong enough character to carry his movie
m/abe_and_phils_last_poker_game," The Last Poker Game is an unexpectedly warm movie, shot with a honed sense of visual storytelling-especially given the director's newness with all this-and an eye for textures, but one which flames out into a terribly overwrought ending."
m/abel," Abel is blighted by limp plotting and anaemic characters, leaving it as flat as a steamrollered tortilla."
m/aberdeen, Moland brings to his film a sensitivity to the complexities of evolving relationships.
m/abominable, The picky eaters in the audience won't even realize they were chowing down on broccoli... and loving it.
m/about_a_boy," It's the perfect star vehicle for Grant, allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling, tongue-tied screen persona."
m/about_adam," Stuart Townsend does an impressive balancing act in ""About Adam,"" a sly romantic comedy set in Dublin that makes a case for the virtue of infidelity. Sort of."
m/about_alex," Unambitious but amiable, it benefits from the presence of familiar talents."
m/about_cherry," A muddled, inconsequential journey of a surprisingly unsympathetic character and her hazy ride to the top of the porno food chain."
m/about_elly," By allowing a slow-build to his drama, Asghar Farhadi ensures we get a feel for the extended family dynamic before wrong-footing the characters and his audience with the suddeness and deftness of a heartbeat."
m/about_last_night," A marriage between the creative talents of David Mamet and Edward Zwick might seem to be an unlikely union but, in the case of 1986 feature About Last Night..., it is surprisingly effective."
m/about_last_night_2014," thanks mostly to Hart and Hall's fiery comic chemistry, it's frequently hilarious"
m/about_schmidt," A must-see for Nicholson's mesmerizing performance, which would probably hold interest even if the sound were turned off."
m/about_scout_2016," The actors (including Danny Glover as the law) are a fine bunch, but the screenplay can't find anything original to do with them."
m/about_time," Curtis seems deaf to his own preaching, because at two hours, About Time is far too long for its thin parable."
m/above_the_law, An artifact from way back when Steven Seagal was novel and therefore sort of cool.
m/above_the_rim," Above the Rim has its formulaic elements, but it has been vigorously directed by Jeff Pollack, who appreciates the lively and unpretentious aspects of the story."
m/abraham_lincoln_vampire_hunter," Abe Lincoln swinging an axe at slaveholding vampires is sorta exciting not just in itself, as a movie thing, but for its electric jolt of symbolism that sings with raw -- and unexpected -- power."
m/absence_2013," It's been 15 years - can we stop remaking ""The Blair Witch Project"" already?"
m/absence_of_malice," The picture has a smug, demoralizing sense of pervasive corruption."
m/absentia_2012," Absentia is very creepy, non-formulaic and more grounded in relatable personalities than the usual horror film filled with hottie victims and other stereotypes."
m/absentminded_professor," The combination of that schoolboy sense of fun, which is Disney's stock in trade, and a sharper sense of the ridiculous is happily demonstrated in The Absent-Minded Professor."
m/absolute_power, A fairly routine thriller that gets high marks as a result of tight pacing and top-notch acting.
m/absolute_wilson," A rather conventional, Biography Channel-style portrait of a man who helped change the face of theater in the last quarter of the 20th century."
m/absolutely_anything," It's all on Pegg and his goofy charisma to keep things moving. He may not be omnipotent, but he's gifted enough to save the day."
m/absolutely_fabulous_the_movie," Thankfully, Saunders and Lumley bring such zest to the film that its clunkier moments are easily overlooked. It certainly makes better use of its armies of celebrities than was managed in Zoolander 2."
m/absurdistan, An attempt at comic allegory that stretches a thin premise to feature length.
m/abuse_of_weakness, The message in Catherine Breillat's Abuse of Weakness is about the incomprehensibility of the self. It's an autobiographical purging.
m/accattone, The brutality and frigid despair of this 1962 film have had a lasting impact on political filmmaking.
m/acceleration," The unimaginative sets, bizarre lighting choices and laden dialogue don't really matter because it's a really easy watch, completely undemanding and ready to deliver just the right kind of low rent thrills just when they're needed."
m/accepted," More disconcerting is the idea put forward that self-indulgence is a substitute for structured education, or, more to the point, that it's a substitute for life."
m/accident_man," I certainly hope there are more Accident Man movies, but I always hope there are more Scott Adkins movies. This is certainly a fun universe for him to play in, and we could see Fallon cause more accidents and fight more rejects of the Oasis."
m/accidental_husband," A hodge-podge of random story elements that seem to emerge from the land that logic forgot, including a Bollywood segment."
m/accidental_love," Accidental Love appears to have hints of David O. Russell's original social commentary, but the film wastes its potential on annoying slapstick set pieces."
m/accidental_tourist," Stiff and boring, with only Davis giving it a burst of life."
m/accidents-happen," I think this is an extraordinary film, it's like no other I can think of in this country's history."
m/according_to_greta," Misfires when it should've soared, and while Hilary Duff gives the role a forceful middle-finger twinkle, it's wasted on unsophisticated ABC Family leftovers."
m/ace_ventura_pet_detective, A little of Jim Carrey's mugging goofiness goes a long way.... and 90 minutes is way too much.
m/acod, Stu Zicherman's amusing but formulaic man-in-crisis comedy has neither a fully realised protagonist nor a clear message.
m/acolytes," The bleak suburban setting and the mischievous, if somewhat downbeat adolescent lead characters recall Gus Van Sant's oeuvre, though Hewitt doesn't achieve anywhere near the same degree of nuance."
m/across_110th_street," Before studios insisted on an injection of sugary sentiment, this what what a New York cop thriller looked like."
m/across_the_universe," Taymor's signatures are visible throughout, but she is clearly trying hard to gussy up a screenplay that plays more like The Wonder Years without the cultural insight."
m/act_of_god," Act of God fearlessly approaches the natural and the supernatural, and the result is visceral, intellectual, heartbreaking, delightful and instructive, all at once."
m/act_of_valor," If you begin with the dismissive claim that we will experience what the film industry can't do, you'd better be ready to show it and prove it."
m/action_jackson," It's cuckoo bananas, crazy. It's entertaining at the same time, because it's so crazy...but it is not a good movie, and I know this might be blasphemy, but Carl Weathers actually lacks a lot of charisma here..."
m/action_point," If you were a Jackass fan back in their prime, you'll probably still chuckle alongside them as they continue to risk life and limb for the sake of slapstick."
m/action_replayy, Action Replayy promises us a fun romp through an iconic decade of the past: the 1970s. Bollywood in that era was indeed a riot and has been the premise of a few good retro films. This is not one of them.
m/active_measures," ""Active Measures"" names the names and fills in the flowchart of Trump's corruption with gripping authority."
m/acts_of_vengeance," Maybe if one of the movie's biggest lines extols the virtues of shutting (...) up, it might be a novel idea to pass that aphorism along to the writer."
m/acts_of_worship," Digna's struggle with sellout guilt is way more interesting than Alix's boilerplate dissembly, but ultimately Digna's just a pawn in the moralist checkmate."
m/ad_astra," Sublime and stupendous. Beautiful, bold and remarkably executed, this is Gray's masterpiece, driven by a career-best turn from Pitt."
m/adam_2019," Though 2006 might not seem too far removed from our present, in terms of LGBTQ visibility the distance between then and now is considerable. ""Adam"" reminds us how much, thankfully, society has slowly changed and yet how far we still are from real change."
m/adam_resurrected, You've got to hand it to Schrader: He pulls off enough of this impressionistic comedy to provoke passions and arguments anew about a topic that seems done to death.
m/adam_sandler_100_fresh," Whether he's giving a nuanced performance, standing back at a lazy de facto family reunion, or telling silly jokes on a relatively unadorned stage, Sandler feels like himself-and 100% Fresh is a particularly likable, unfussy iteration."
m/adam_sandlers_eight_crazy_nights," This is foul-mouthed, gross, and about as relevant to either Hanukkah or Christmas as hanging a turd on a Christmas tree."
m/adams_apples, Adam's Apples slams together good and evil for maximum black-comedy impact.
m/addams_family," There are a lot of little smiles in The Addams Family, and many chuckles and grins, but they don't add up to much."
m/addams_family_values," Overall this is a far tighter film, from the simpler but ever delightful set design to the sharp script and economical running time."
m/addicted_2014," Watching ""Addicted"" is like eating Cheese Whiz straight from the jar. There's no nutritional value. It's kind of embarrassing. But it does satisfy a base craving for cheap, immediate sensation."
m/addicted_to_fame," [A] hapless, clueless, necrophiliac documentary ..."
m/addicted_to_love," What bothered me more was that the characters are supposed to be intelligent, and yet they have the maturity of gnats. It is always a problem in a love story when the rival seems more interesting than the hero, and that's what happens here."
m/addiction_incorporated," Like most documentaries detailing the efforts of corporate whistle-blowers, Charles Evans Jr.'s vrit expos venerates its subject's (admittedly worthy) actions to the point where legitimate fascination sours into uncritical appreciation."
m/adieu_au_langage," It's a good bit funnier, as well as freer in its rapid-fire associations, than the more strident and structured Film Socialisme."
m/adjustment_bureau, It's not a thriller... adjust your expectations from what you may be expecting and you'll find it hard not be carried along for the ride.
m/admiral_2016," The dialog talks down a little to the viewers who are intended in large part to be school students, but it pays the viewer back in thrilling visual images."
m/admission," What appears on paper to be an ideal three-dimensional, morally complex role for the quick-witted comedienne backfires in practice, relying on Fey to be funny in a movie that works better serious."
m/adopt_a_highway," In an ensemble cast of small roles where his character is the only one with a film-length arc, Hawke's performance quite literally carries the movie."
m/adoration," After some flops, Egoyan is back with a film that explores a central theme of his work, the impact of the media and technology on interpersonal communication and identity formation."
m/adore_2013, The disparity between the inherently trashy appeal of the story and the self-serious way it's presented cripples much of the potential for enjoyment.
m/adrift_2018, What might have been a typical disaster movie about perfunctorily established characters heading into peril together...instead becomes a love story that keeps asserting and reinforcing itself as the film goes along. It's elegant in the cutting.
m/adult_beginners," An exhausting, predictable bit of tear-jerker fluff with a handful of decent scenes. It's the type of film people who don't take film seriously think is really edgy."
m/adult_world_2013," There are flashes of wit in this quirky comedy, but thin characterization and by-the-numbers plotting lead Adult World to slip into tonally haphazard tedium."
m/advanced_style_2014, The same punters who kept returning to see Bill Cunningham New York will find much to savour.
m/adventureland," Wants to be one of those great John Hughes movies, but it doesn't have the poignancy to pull something like that off."
m/adventures_in_babysitting," Fun for kids, maybe. Sheer drudgery for anyone beyond a Jr. High School reading comprehension level."
m/adventures_in_babysitting_2015," To my surprise, this Disney Channel Original Movie did not take on the same cookie cutter format of almost every single DCOM so far: cheesy, wholesome fun."
m/adventures_of_baron_munchausen," The film also feels overlong at times, but while it's not as great as it could have been, it's still definitely worth seeing."
m/adventures_of_elmo_in_grouchland," Tailor-made for small-fry with the same care, imagination, and subtle adult-friendly witticisms that have made the long-running children's program so successful."
m/adventures_of_pluto_nash," (Supposedly) its release has been held up for nearly two years because of its complicated visual effects. Yeah, right: And the moon is made of green cheese."
m/adventures_of_power, Gold's screenplay is a tad too ambitious for its thin comic premise.
m/adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert," Unpredictable, adventurous and entertaining, Priscilla is that wonderful thing in showbiz, a unique work entirely of its own creation, but informed by the culture from whence it has erupted."
m/adventures_of_rocky_and_bullwinkle, Slathered in saccharine moralizing and dully sentimental plotting.
m/advise_and_consent," Incisive, sometimes brutal, study of American high politics, based on Allen Drury's best-selling novel, featuring outstanding performances from the leads and a great collection of character actors."
m/aelita_queen_of_mars," While Aelita doesn't surpass Fritz Lang's 1926 classic Metropolis, it is a major early achievement in futuristic cinema..."
m/aeon_flux," I usually bypass puns based upon a film's title, but here I can't help myself: Aeon Flux is a flux-up of prodigious proportions."
m/affair_of_the_necklace," It may not be Dangerous Liaisons, but it's a rendezvous that's largely worth risking."
m/affair_to_remember," ...the kind of film you don't see much anymore, an old-fashioned love story."
m/afflicted_2013," It's exciting, expertly done and I don't want to tell you any more because half the fun is in the surprise."
m/affliction," ...gripping, the downward spiral taking on genuinely tragic inevitability."
m/affluenza_2014, Nothing is revealing or surprising in this horse-beating tale of spiritual poverty among the extremely wealthy.
m/afghan_cycles," What we get is a much more complex, multi-layered portrait of Afghanistan than has been see in the West for many a year."
m/afghan_star," Sobering and cautiously optimistic, Havana Marking's documentary is a treat."
m/african_cats, The film's incredible visual intimacy is its undeniable selling point.
m/after_2014," I've never had a movie try to guilt me into acceptance right before the credits rolled, but I guess there's a first time for everything?"
m/after_2019," When the back-story of how a movie came to be ends up being more interesting than the finished product, that isn't going to help matters. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
m/after_class," The Messiest Dramedy of the Year...still a fun mess to watch, and a fine showcase for Justin Long."
m/after_dark_my_sweet," The film is a hot-wired crime thriller that captures [Jim] Thompson's flair for hard action, malicious wit and fevered eroticism."
m/after_earth," It's really the helmer's iffy creative decisions that keep After Earth more of a wince-inducing drag than the heart-squeezing, mind-blowing sci-fi adventure it desires to be."
m/after_everything," Even though a health crisis is at the center of this relationship-driven dramedy, After Everything is as far from a Nicholas Sparks film as it gets."
m/after_fall_winter_2012," Wants to be some sort of non-puritan (queer?) version of Lost in Translation, but its screenplay is too wordy to be able to feign inspired originality."
m/after_image," After Image is many thing, but most of all, it's boring."
m/after_innocence, Sanders inspires joy in life's redemption and anger towards the ludicrous ways some states treat the exonerated.
m/after_life_2010," A tense, elegant, intelligent thriller that will have audiences debating whether Liam Neeson's character is a serial killer or a kindly mortician."
m/after_louie, Even though the film has a plodding pace there are flashes of honesty and brilliance that make this film worth a passive look.
m/after_love, An unflinching portrait of the final weeks of a marriage.
m/after_lucia_2012, After Lucia is an uncomfortable and disturbing experience with a vengeful sting in the tail that sinks our already taut and wrung out emotions into even more chilling waters.
m/after_midnight_2020," Something Else promises monsters but delivers more demons of the human experience variety, as this sweet and sincere creature feature is far more romantically heartfelt than expected."
m/after_stonewall," a handsomely produced film that doesn't explore new territory or forge ahead with new insight, but is useful, nonetheless, as a primer on the history of the period"
m/after_the_ball_2014," It's predictable and a little bit ridiculous, but After The Ball is a lot of fun."
m/after_the_dark," Doesn't end convincingly, but the opening two acts are stimulating enough to carry the viewing experience, capturing the cutthroat nature of endurance and the brutal reality of judgment in desperate times."
m/after_the_fall_2014," Fall isn't going to cure the world's ills, but it does define a few of them to satisfaction, creating an engrossing journey into extremity without ringing all the obvious bells on the way down."
m/after_the_storm_2017," Echoes 2008's Still Walking in its gentle, wry wisdom."
m/after_the_sunset, After the Sunset has the audacity to con audiences with a script seen a million times before.
m/after_the_thin_man," Cute, though like its predecessor, more than a little dated."
m/after_the_wedding," This mightn't be as fun as a Big Fat Greek Wedding, but there's at least as many broken plates afterwards..."
m/after_the_wedding_2019, The movie feels like a soap opera - but in a good way.
m/after_tiller_2013," ""No body wants a fucking abortion"" exclaims one of the doctors, and this is at the heart of the tough decisions that are played out every day within each clinic"
m/after_we_leave," Once in a while, a budget indie film comes along that makes us glad this art form is still around. After We Leave is a shining example of indie filmmaking at its finest."
m/afterglow, Rudolph cares for his characters rather than patronizing their often foolish behavior.
m/aftermath, What seems clearly intended as homage comes out as pastiche.
m/aftermath_2014," A rumination on how long humans will actually last, if left entirely to their own devices. And it isn't pretty."
m/aftermath_2017, This grim psychological drama becomes ever more ponderous ...
m/afternoon_delight_2013," These are very much first-world problems, and the portrayal of Temple's happy hooker is a tad disingenuous. Nevertheless, the fleshed-out performances keep it sympathetic."
m/afternoon_of_a_faun_tanaquil_le_clercq," While it does profile the work of brilliant dancer, the film also contains two complex and moving love stories as well an account of a physically devastating tragedy followed by an extraordinary tale of struggle and survival."
m/afterschool," If there is one distinctive and promising voice to come out of the info-bite aesthetic of the YouTube generation it is Antonio Campos, whose debut feature Afterschool puts an intriguing spin on the high-school tragedy."
m/aftershock_2013, by coloring within the lines it is an effective midnight movie
m/against_the_ropes," If Jackie were Jack, this film would probably make TV, nothing more."
m/against_the_sun," Overly familiar, but still slightly more moving than ""Unbroken,"" which covers some of the same nautical territory."
m/against_the_wall, Penetrates to the very heart of post-dot-com bohemian San Francisco
m/age_of_consent," Age of Consent is never as provocative or engrossing as it should be, but there is enough of interest (especially Mirren) to make it worth a look."
m/age_of_heroes," The gruelling training, clandestine mission and sacrifice is familiar Boy's Own stuff but the lack of a decent budget really hurts the film."
m/age_of_innocence," Martin Scorsese's adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel is like a beautiful, detailed painting of an entire period, yet it remains static and uninvolving."
m/age_of_kill," This is truly terrible: a cost-cutting British action thriller with clunky script, wooden acting, uncertain directing, cheapo-looking interiors and the most outrageously obvious and rubbish ""twist"" reveal at the end."
m/age_of_the_dragons," Entirely forgettable and somewhat unhealthy, lingering on the palate like an impulsive, Friday-night kebab."
m/agent_cody_banks, Agent Cody Banks reimagines your average James Bond flick as kiddie porn.
m/agent_cody_banks_2_destination_london, The first Cody Banks worked by playing on the immense gap between secret-agent sophistication and hormonal teenage awkwardness; volume 2 never finds a similar conceit to milk.
m/agent_vinod_2012," The middle section drags, and there is a full hour in this film that could easily be edited out."
m/agnes_browne," This is a modest but likable film, and Anjelica Huston plays a heroine who makes us smile. But it's skimpy material."
m/agnes_of_god," Fonda's relentless interrogating, mannered chain-smoking and enforced two dimensionality cause her to become tiresome very early on."
m/agony_and_the_ecstasy," Required viewing for the fan of pious filmmaking or the cinematographer in film school. From a story and character perspective, it's sadly very forgettable."
m/agora," The mother of all secular humanists fights a losing battle against freshly minted religious zealots in ""Agora,"" a visually imposing, high-minded epic."
m/aguirre_the_wrath_of_god," It's a truly amazing movie, an epic made from genius, stubbornness, and madness."
m/ai_artificial_intelligence," A.I. is certainly more thought provoking than any summer blockbuster we've been presented with yet this season, but it leaves us wishing Spielberg had applied more of Kubrick's obsessive fine tuning."
m/ai_weiwei_never_sorry_2012," The fluidity and convenience of digital moviemaking tools explain some of its freshness, as does Ms. Klayman's history as a budding documentarian."
m/ai_weiwei_the_fake_case," With the aid of Johnsen's doc to overcome the obstacles China has put in his path, however, Ai's voice carries louder than ever before."
m/aileen_life_and_death_of_a_serial_killer, As much a pointed and wise exploration of a documentarian's involvement in his subject matter as it is an angry indictment of the American judicial system.
m/aint_in_it_for_my_health_a_film_about_levon_helm," An unsentimental, salt-of-the-earth tribute that keeps the beat in a way that would make this extraordinary journeyman beam."
m/aint_them_bodies_saints_2013," David Lowery's Ain't Them Bodies Saints landed with the excitement of a bold new voice, and yet, there's also something undeniably old-fashioned in his approach, suggesting a lost artifact freshly unearthed from the 1970s."
m/air-bud-golden-receiver, The Problem with the Air Bud sequel is simple: too many people and not enough dog.
m/air_2015," Writer-director Christian Cantamessa and co-writer Chris Pasetto aim for a Danny Boyle-Alex Garland-style psychological thriller like 2007's ""Sunshine,"" but they don't adequately account for all of the mood swings."
m/air_america, Air America never finds a righteous pace -- it's an expensive ghost town mood with two handsome leads spending their screentime mentally cashing their paychecks.
m/air_bud, A basketball playing Golden Retriever shows his stuff on several high-school basketball courts.
m/air_force," Howard Hawks finds a perfect vehicle for his study of the male group. William Faulkner polished the dialogue, but as a silent it would still be tremendously exciting and evocative."
m/air_force_one," Harrison Ford is one of the most likable and convincing of movie stars, and he almost pulls off the impossible in Air Force One.' I don't mean he saves the day; I mean he almost saves the movie."
m/air_guitar_nation," Air Guitar Nation is a wonderfully wild ride of a documentary, and the greatest trick of the picture is found in how it makes the audience succumb to the power of the sport."
m/airplane," ...a nonstop flurry of slapstick sight gags, puns, innuendoes, exaggerations, and caricatures. A comedy classic."
m/airplane_2_the_sequel, it works largely on our fond memories of the first movie
m/airport_77," Airport '77 sounds like it would be the dopiest of them all, but it's actually not bad, thanks to a surprisingly strong cast and a tendency to avoid any camp."
m/ajami," The complexity might require a second viewing, but there is compensation in the realistic acting by a cast of non-pros and the eye-grabbing, hand-held lensing by Boaz Yehonatan Yacov."
m/aka_jane_roe," The country's failure to do right by McCorvey is similar to its failure to protect access to abortion; the documentary, however, remains too chickens--- to interrogate that relationship."
m/aka_tommy_chong," It is also a portrait of resilience: Chong does his time (nine months) and has the last laugh, emerging as a born-again activist-survivor of the culture wars."
m/akeelah_and_the_bee," Palmer soars, carrying writer/director Doug Atchison's film on new 'tween wings."
m/akira," Sure, computers are fine for flatulent ogres and dark-haired cyber-honeys, but no single work has been strong or thrilling enough to better Akira."
m/akmareul_boattda," Brutally violent yet beautiful to look at, I Saw the Devil is one of the truest examples of ""cat and mouse"" storytelling I've ever seen."
m/akron, The best and worst thing about the movie is that you could probably change Benny and Christopher to a heterosexual couple and not have to change a single line of the screenplay.
m/aladdin," Riffs enough on the original to not be a complete replica, but relies on it enough to not be a reinvention. It splits the difference in a way that largely works."
m/aladdin-and-the-king-of-thieves," The movie packs a helluva lot of plot into a tight 77-minute run time (current Disney execs, take note)."
m/alamar, a film full-to-bursting with vitality and generosity
m/alamo, Cartoonishly awful! Remember the Alamo but forget this movie.
m/alan_partridge," It takes a while to get over the strangeness of seeing Partridge on the big screen, but once the siege stirs into motion Coogan excels as Alan haplessly channels Spy Who Loved Me-era Roger Moore."
m/albatross_2011," It's an interesting premise; though despite being evidently autobiographical in origin, the fictional treatment has made it look sentimental and unreal."
m/albert_nobbs," A gripping ensemble piece, good-humoured even at the end of its tether."
m/albino_alligator," Pretentious and show-offy, the noirish drama fairly reeks of film-student overkill."
m/aleksandr-nevskiy-alexander-nevsky," It is impossible... not to marvel at his stylistic insistence that all people walk along a sky-line, and not to wish, in the same breath, that more directors had his talent for doing great things so well and little things so badly."
m/alex_and_emma," The movie works. Well, it does for me. And, I suspect, it will for anyone who isn't looking for Dostoevsky."
m/alex_cross," Slipping out of his comfort zones for a bit as both Madea and director of his own movies, Tyler Perry tries on a new persona for size in Alex Cross as, well, Morgan Freeman. Sort of."
m/alex_of_venice, Winstead can telegraph more with a head tilt or a flicker of her eyes than most of her generation can do with a wild hand toss and a mess of expositional dialogue.
m/alex_rider_operation_stormbreaker," [At its best,] Stormbreaker gets the balance right, managing to be both playfully humorous and genuinely exciting."
m/alex_strangelove," Alex Strangelove is most credible and affecting when the kids at its centre speak out, act out and make out with the insecurity and inconsistency of, well, kids."
m/alexander, This half-cocked creation is ostensibly about the Macedonian king but doubles as an allegory for both George W. Bush's political career and Stone's own struggle with history.
m/alexander_and_the_terrible_horrible_no_good_very_bad_day," Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day could have been a lot more horrible and no good than it is."
m/alexander_the_last," What looks like a drama of adultery turns out to be an exploration of how the spaces between people can separate them or join them, often at the same moment."
m/alexanders_ragtime_band," Irving Berlin's Alexander's Ragtime Band is a grand filmusical which stirs and thrills, a medley of more than 30 pieces, selected from some 600 which Berlin has composed."
m/alexandras-project, One of the year's true surprise packages..will have you gasping for breath right up until the very last cinematic shock
m/alfie," Alfie plays homage to its roots while creating its own, deeply absorbing movie experience."
m/algorithms_2013, But the result is simply a literal draining of additional color from an already pallid piece of work that does little justice to the incredible struggles of these exceptional young men.
m/ali," Ali isn't a bad film, in fact, it's OK. But the bottom line is, the man everyone called 'The Greatest' deserves better than an OK picture."
m/ali-g-indahouse-the-movie, A raw comedy that is intermittently hilarious as it attacks pretty much every taboo around.
m/ali_wong_baby_cobra," The meat of her act is bold and provocative - covering sex and race and marriage - and, considering just how pregnant she is, it also singles her out as an especially gifted physical comedian."
m/ali_wong_hard_knock_wife," [Ali] Wong has perfected that basic yet elusive trick that some writers spend their entire lives failing to master: She makes you feel as if it's just the two of you, and she trusts you enough to tell you how she really feels."
m/alice_2009," In pursuit of political correctness we get an Alice who beats up a knife-toting pirate after first warning him, ""Don't even think about it, buddy!"""
m/alice_adams," This all attempts to be folksy comedy, but very often falls into savage satire."
m/alice_doesnt_live_here_anymore," Scorsese's female-centered dramas are rare enough things, but Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is a bona fide classic."
m/alice_in_wonderland_through_the_looking_glass," The result is an always diverting, never dull fantasy that rarely stays still long enough for the viewer to pick holes."
m/alice_neel, The fascinating documentary Alice Neel illuminates history while also demonstrating how an artist's style reveals his or her personality.
m/alice_sweet_alice," Sole develops a very strange atmosphere... [he] uses striking colors to punctuate the grim atmosphere, and occasionally an extremely wide angle will crop up to accentuate the feeling of unease; even the sound is tricky."
m/alien," In space, the famous tagline went, no one can hear you scream. In Alien, you can hear lessons for the sci-fi future in a great milestone from the recent past."
m/alien3," Ironically, Alien 3 is not a bad movie. In fact -- here's the rub -- it's too interesting to make an exciting summer flick."
m/alien_abduction_2014," With his first published screenplay, Robert Lewis treads a familiar path, but the devil's in the details and some well handled subtext on preconceived notions."
m/alien_covenant," Alien: Covenant is full of bad decisions, both by the creative team and by the characters themselves. There are good set pieces in Alien: Covenant, but the story connecting them is nonsense."
m/alien_nation," This plot contains the elements of a good idea, but it does so little with it, and is so cheerfully willing to recycle an absolutely standard story, that the idea is finally just frustrating."
m/alien_outpost," Though well-executed, [Alien Outpost is] ultimately overly familiar and predictable."
m/alien_raiders," Suffice to say that Alien Raiders has a few modest surprises up its sleeve, and that's more than most low-budget genre concoctions even attempt."
m/alien_resurrection," While too cold and formulaic to fully satisfy, ""Resurrection"" has enough darkly rewarding moments to warrant a visit."
m/alien_trespass," Kooky faux blast from the past eating disorder space monster fugitives craving humans for dinner, sexpot dames with flirty libidos who would make the Hays Code censorship suits faint back then, and memory lane mayhem with humans wielding table salt."
m/alien_vs_predator, Even a pre-release non-Alien vs. Predator fan such as myself found plenty of reasons to give this one a high recommendation.
m/aliens_in_the_attic," Like those mild old Disney comedies of the '60s and '70s, it seems perfectly content with being a harmless distraction."
m/aliens_of_the_deep," Aliens of the Deep has a few moments of awe but its overall message is utilitarian, using ocean exploration as a stepping stone to outer space adventures."
m/alila, Another piece of essential viewing for outsiders trying to understand life in the Middle East.
m/alis_wedding," ...an immensely charming offering, but falls short of being a new classic."
m/alita_battle_angel," It'll remind you of 50 other films at least, from The Fifth Element to Blade Runner, and for anyone unlucky enough to have seen it, the crashingly tedious Total Recall remake."
m/alive_inside," The movie hovers between diatribe and misplaced diplomacy. At certain times, you want to ask Rossato-Bennett ""What's the problem?"""
m/all-in-the-poker-movie," Celebrating the worldwide poker renaissance, it's intriguing in the way it delineates another way to chase the American Dream."
m/all_about_lily_chou_chou, Poignant Japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak.
m/all_about_my_mother, Few melodramas with such tragic underpinnings have ever made me feel so intensely happy.
m/all_about_steve," The movie is trying to show the power of words and that there is no such thing as a ""normal"" person. It should garner a boatload of nominations for Razzie Awards that are given to the worst movies of the year."
m/all_about_the_benjamins, The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma. We don't even like their characters.
m/all_cheerleaders_die," For all the grim fatalism of its title (well, apart from the 'cheerleaders' bit), this is a very funny film - a darkly irreverent joyride through the angst and sexual complication of the teen years, with added zombies, magic and freaky CG gore."
m/all_day_and_a_night, Jeffrey Wright is scalding hot as the father to the young hood in a hoodie
m/all_dogs_go_to_heaven," Reynolds surely has a bone to pick with his woofish alter ego, who has all the actor's swagger but little of his diffident charm."
m/all_eyez_on_me_2017," Although All Eyez on Me occasionally dips into Tupac's complex nature, it always zips away the moment deeper motivations and themes are explored."
m/all_good_things, This feverishly creepy but dramatically miscalculated picture reps an unhappy marriage of murky psychodrama and dubious theorizing.
m/all_i_can_say," Both elegy and unintentional suicide note, the film is one of the most devastating archival collages playing this year's Tribeca festival."
m/all_i_see_is_you," It's introspective and deliberate, a movie that gets to its point slowly, all its meandering and scene-setting doing the good work of priming us for a grim little payoff."
m/all_i_wish, It's too predictable and too disingenuous about the realities of what it means to be an 'older' woman. But Sharon Stone is totally charming.
m/all_is_bright_2013, The cinematic equivalent of a half-baked fruitcake.
m/all_is_lost_2013," Engrossing both dramatically and as a minimalist narrative exercise, All Is Lost is a survival-at-sea story powered by an emphasis on realism and a refusal to allow any false emotional beats to impede on this unsentimental tale."
m/all_is_true," Watching Branagh and McKellen in gently dueling versions of Sonnet 29 provides that pleasure; the rest of ""All Is True,"" unfortunately, strains to honor its beloved subject."
m/all_is_well_2018," Though only East Berlin-born director Eva Trobisch's feature debut, this is already a mature, fully realized film that is markedly better than the work of a lot of more seasoned directors..."
m/all_mistakes_buried, This story about self/drug abuse would be nowhere as remarkable were it not for Trammell's performance and McCann and Chris Kursel's editing choices.
m/all_nighter_2017," Despite J.K. Simmons' gruff charm and inarguable charisma, the movie is so slight it vanishes without a trace faster than the dislocated Ginnie."
m/all_over_the_guy, Forgets to iron out the kinks that make the straight romantic comedies feel like tediously long television sitcoms.
m/all_relative_2014," Imagine ""The Graduate"" as rewritten by a golden retriever, and you'll have some inkling of the intelligence level in the rom-com ""All Relative."""
m/all_roads_lead_home, All Roads Lead Home is more hackneyed than it is heartwarming. It's considerably more annoying than it is enjoyable.
m/all_roads_lead_to_rome_2008, Apparently those roads are littered with clichs and contrivances.
m/all_saints," In the genre of faith-based films, Gomer's effort does a good job of being candid about its faith without becoming preachy and serves as an appealing illustration of the principles it espouses."
m/all_square," From director John Hyams ... and writer Timothy Brady ... comes All Square, a rough and rowdy gem of a movie that tells of small stakes with big consequences."
m/all_stars," Some day, God willing, there will be a moratorium on films about plucky kids putting on talent shows to save their schools/parks/yoof centres from predatory developers."
m/all_summers_end," While Sheridan is inherently appealing, he bravely renders Conrad's cowardice at key moments."
m/all_that_heaven_allows," Hudson is handsome and somewhat wooden. Laconic of speech, and imbued with an angel's patience and understanding, it's at times hard to understand his passion for the widow, what with pretty girls just spoilingfor his attention."
m/all_the_bright_places," A warm, thoughtful portrait of teen trauma and grief."
m/all_the_devils_men, All The Devil's Men is a brawny Michael Mann-style thriller from writer-director Matthew Hope.
m/all_the_kings_men," Overstuffed and fatally miscast, All the King's Men never comes to life."
m/all_the_little_animals, Interesting despite its hipster crypticism and an imperfect finale. Is Christian Bale in every film Lions Gate has made?
m/all_the_money_in_the_world_2017," It has style, and good people, and interesting locations around the world. Yet in the end it's a little like Getty himself. It's got everything that money can buy -- except for that one little, genuine spark of life it can't."
m/all_the_presidents_men," Hal Holbrook is outstanding; this actor, herein in near-total shadow, is as compelling as he is in virtually every role played."
m/all_the_pretty_horses, Misses the mark as a classic drama about coming of age....what we see on the screen is curiously devoid of soul.
m/all_the_queens_men," Wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II? Um, no. But here's a movie about it anyway."
m/all_the_real_girls," His theme is first love -- a director-slayer if ever there was one -- yet Green makes it fresh, funny and infinitely sad as he uses this theme to open up characters to undiscovered realms within themselves."
m/all_the_right_moves," Cruise has always been an underrated actor, but this is early ""non wacko"" Cruise"
m/all_the_way_2016," All the Way tries to delve into that period from the perspective of the D.C. wheeler-dealer at the very top of the power structure, but this historical exploration unfortunately only goes part of the way."
m/all_these_small_moments, All These Small Moments reminded me a great deal of two films in particular: that of the recent Lady Bird and this year's very underseen and underrated Blame.
m/all_things_must_pass_the_rise_and_fall_of_tower_records," Any movie that begins and ends with the sound of a phonograph needle hitting vinyl knows the audience sweet spot it's aiming for, and for those folks, ""All Things Must Pass"" is a rousing success."
m/all_things_to_all_men," Oh lord, that was a genuinely complex and gripping London-set noir."
m/all_this_and_heaven_too," Anatole Litvak directs with tact and restraint this period melodrama (a woman's picture) about a governess who falls for her employer-nobleman. Davis and Boyer are good, but it's Barbara O'Neil who stands out as Boyer's neurotic and obsessive wife."
m/all_through_the_night, Enjoyable WWII propaganda made by great cast and slick direction
m/all_we_had," It's an episodic picture, and perhaps a premise seen one too many times, but Holmes finds a way to soften cliché and make the feature feel lived-in and emotionally true."
m/allan_quatermain_and_the_lost_city_of_gold," Once again donning a fedora to match Indiana Jones, Chamberlain's Quatermain is the generic, wise-cracking, bearded, low-grade substitute for a real swashbuckler."
m/alle_anderen," A multi-facedted, multi-nuanced, extremely powerful dissescion of a newly formed bond, put under the scrutiny of uncompromising camera, contesting prevalent notions of love and sex, masculinity and feminitity."
m/allied," Big-budget bluster careens through the emotional premise of the movie, and it's not helped by the casting."
m/alls_faire_in_love," If you don't like the word 'penis' but crack up at the use of 'wang,' 'ding dong,' 'wenis' and 'wiener,' this is your movie."
m/allure_2018, There's no reprieve from the dour tone of Carlos and Jason Sanchez's film.
m/almayers_folly_2012," After a powerful opening scene and reasonably strong first act, the pic slowly leaks air."
m/almost_an_angel," I cannot, however, much as I'd like to, quite recommend this movie -- the going gets a little thick at the end, and some of the plot developments are dumb... But that isn't to say I'm scornful of the film's special qualities and its gentle good humor."
m/almost_christmas_2016," Almost Christmas aptly captures the universal experience of family holiday gatherings with all the emotional luggage, old scores to settle and opportunities to start afresh."
m/almost_famous, It's done so well ... that it's hard to know whom to really single out for praise here.
m/almost_friends, [The film] has an easygoing charm that should earn it a solid place among the subset of movies about young people who emerge from their small-town cocoons and screw up their courage to take flight for the bright lights of New York City.
m/almost_heroes," Perry has his charms as the prissy Chandler on Friends, but he can't generate the big personality required to make that act work on the big screen."
m/almost_human_2012, The degree to which Almost Human ultimately peters out is rather distressing (to put it mildly)...
m/almost_love," Energetic yet angsty, Sell By offers a viewer experience a bit like babysitting a six-year-old -- charming in places, certainly funny, but also exhausting and liable to try one's patience."
m/aloft," Aloft is a meditative, thoughtful film, that wants to glide like a hawk into the sky and inspire us to wonder, but its narrative has feet of clay that all the wispy winsomeness cannot conceal."
m/aloha_2015," Equally hobbled by an amateurish script and vaguely defined characters, the movie's long list of mediocrities have an anonymous quality, as though the director has been completely reborn as a hack."
m/alone_2018, Alain Hernandez dominates... portraying a survivor. [Full review in Spanish]
m/alone_2020_2, One of the best and most exciting thrillers of the year.
m/alone_in_berlin," Handsomely packaged, the film unfortunately is also too well-behaved and lacking in psychological depth to really set itself apart from countless other WWII dramas theatrically, even if pockets of older audiences might be responsive."
m/alone_in_the_dark," They say that even ugly babies have faces their mothers love, but this is truly a film that not even hardcore genre fans could appreciate."
m/alone_with_her," Writer and director Eric Nicholas's latest film, Alone With Her, is a voyeuristic thriller that is fiendishly assured yet ultimately less than the sum of its parts."
m/along_came_a_spider," From the gripping action sequence that opens the movie until the last twist, director Tamahori keeps the audience on the edge of their seats."
m/along_came_polly," The fringes are full of brilliant digressions and hilarious supporting turns, but the central story is a black hole."
m/along_came_the_devil," Along Came the Devil balances haunting imagery and genuine scares with a realistic story about family, tragedy, and overcoming loss"
m/alpha_2018," Harrowing and heartwarming, this coming-of-age tale of unlikely ""fwends"" is a phenomenal, pulse-pounding journey worth taking. This is The Black Stallion for a new generation."
m/alpha_and_omega," Young viewers might be distracted enough by the log-sledding critters to overlook the movie's lack of wit, but for most, there's nothing here to howl about."
m/alpha_dog," A gritty urban crime drama involving teenagers, guns, drugs and sex, all sharply acted, well-directed and astutely put together"
m/alphabet_killer," Chega a impressionar que, em meio a tantos elementos desastrosos, a atuação de Eliza Dushku (que também co-produziu o longa) seja inegavelmente a pior coisa do filme."
m/alphaville," A poetic, funny, and visually inspired blend of sci-fi, detective-film satire, and political allegory."
m/alps," Puzzling and provocative, Alps has a lingering power and an effect that is thrillingly difficult to define."
m/alright_now," ""Alright Now"" is actually not alright. It lost my attention very quickly until the last third of the film."
m/altered_carbon_resleeved, Resleeved is a solid watch for fans of the live-action series. It expands the universe a little bit in some pleasant ways.
m/altered_states," There isn't a lucid moment in it (and much of the dialogue is rendered unintelligible by Russell's subversive direction), but it has dash, style, and good looks, as well as the funniest curtain line since Some Like It Hot."
m/altina," It was an amazing life, but surprisingly, it does not register excitingly on film. The approach is uninspired and prosaic, too much the work of a dutiful family member than intensely probing and revelatory."
m/alvin_and_the_chipmunks_chipwrecked_2011," Overall, Mike Mitchell's assault will appeal only to the under-10 set and send everyone else running for ear plugs."
m/alvin_and_the_chipmunks_the_road_chip, The last drop of charm was wrung out of this ensemble a couple of sequels ago.
m/always, The result is a curiosity: a remake that wasn't remade enough.
m/always_be_my_maybe_2019," Crazy Rich Asians was a watershed moment in Hollywood, but I'm excited to see more movies like Always Be My Maybe get made."
m/always_shine, The passive-aggressive balance in the dialogue is perfectly modulated between encouragement and undermining.
m/always_woodstock, Any film justifies its existence when it gives Katey Sagal a chance to sing.
m/am_i_black_enough_for_you, There's not enough about the conflicts between Paul and those who controlled his records but this is a fan-like yet not too oleaginous tribute.
m/amadeus," Amadeus is a must for any music lover, any film lover, or anyone who reveres excellence."
m/amal," There is nothing obvious about the story, which moves carefully and unpredictably, taking us through the streets of Delhi with a view from the back of a rickshaw."
m/amanda_knox, It's a carefully balanced and frightening film with Knox a terrifyingly unknowable character at the grisly centre.
m/amandla_a_revolution_in_four_part_harmony, Poignant archival shots punctuate the importance of these beautifully rendered freedom songs.
m/amarcord, Fellini's whimsical and tender semi-autobiographical film is one of his best works.
m/amateur_2018," An engaging tale from the corrupt underbelly of Big Time Hoops at the high school level, one that loses its cynical edge and goes all squishy in the third act"
m/amateur_night_2016," ""Amateur Night"" isn't wild or funny. It would rather spray its characters with vaginal fluid than dream up a killer punchline."
m/amazing_grace_2018, It's as if Franklin is sending a message to us from the great beyond. Thank heaven.
m/amazing_grace_and_chuck, Ultimately Mike Newell manages to make the film into something worthwhile.
m/amelia_2009, Swank has fun in the role - I haven't seen her smile this much in years - but she isn't given much complicated to do besides frustrate her friends when she digs in her heels.
m/amelie, A fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions
m/amen, Turns an infuriating and frustrating predicament into a thriller of the conscience.
m/amer, There used to be a climate for dares like this; let's re-create it.
m/america_america," ... while rich with detail of the life and culture of early 20th Century Turkey, it doesn't flow as much as pool around various episodes on the road of Stavros' education."
m/america_imagine_the_world_without_her_2014," Graced with a hilariously definitive title, America is astonishingly facile, a film comprised entirely of straw man arguments."
m/america_the_beautiful_2008," America the Beautiful is a great film - a provocative cautionary tale that fingers crossed, might also act as a wake-up call."
m/american-pastime," Full of interesting characters and placed in a charged setting, but the preachy and obvious spin it takes is ultimately melodramatic and predictable."
m/american-pie-5-the-naked-mile, A typically worthless straight-to-video American Pie sequel...
m/american-the-bill-hicks-story, American: The Bill Hicks Story is the kind of film that every artist hopes will be made of their life's work some day.
m/american_animal_2011," D'Elia's debut feature is, I think, a challenge worth taking. Here, it appears, is a real emerging vision, original, gutsy, and uncompromising."
m/american_animals, The rich genre of crime film in which dumbasses get themselves in way over their heads has a proud new entry with American Animals.
m/american_assassin_2017, So beige and unmemorable that this writer struggled to recall any sort of palpable plot details mere hours after the credits rolled.
m/american_astronaut," Wittily juvenile with clever, catchy songs to match."
m/american_beauty," Well-acted, reasonably insightful, and often laugh-out-loud funny."
m/american_circumcision," A must for parents-to-be considering this issue - if only because, whatever they choose, it can help to give them confidence that they have made an informed decision - Brendon Marotta's film presents a wide-ranging analysis of a neglected subject."
m/american_crime, Tragic tale of child abuse fails to make any sense of the crime.
m/american_dreamer_2019, Smart indie films like this don't come around too often. See it however/wherever you can and then bookend the experience by picking up a copy of Bradbury's short stories.
m/american_dreamz, American Dreamz suffers from an overabundance of subplots and characters.
m/american_fable," With a bit more energy and a bit more soul, American Fable could have been exceptional - instead, it's just very good."
m/american_factory," American Factory may not have the character-driven allure or celebrity factor of most successful theatrical docs, but it should be widely embraced by film festivals and TV buyers around the world..."
m/american_flyers," Thankfully, Costner and Grant are able to overcome the bumpy screenplay and ride American Flyers to a satisfying, if predictable, conclusion."
m/american_folk, The film belatedly emerges as one of the stronger fictional statements on 9/11.
m/american_friend, A gripping Hitchockian thriller based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith.
m/american_gangster, Say hello to my leetle M.B.A! It's the black Scarface. But American Gangster is an economic education with as many bullet points as bullets.
m/american_gigolo," Schrader's third outing as a director is betrayed by a curious, uncharacteristic evasiveness at its core."
m/american_graffiti, American Graffiti has a timeless power that speaks to everyone who was ever a teenager.
m/american_grindhouse," In its academic approach, American Grindhouse is like sex ed: the lecture gets tedious, but it's worth sitting through for the pictures."
m/american_gun," The acting is pro enough to keep your blood up, but the reverb is minimal."
m/american_hangman," Coneybeare appears to be constructing workplace dramas based on things he knows only from other, better movies."
m/american_hardcore, tells you everything you need to know about how vital this music was
m/american_haunting," It's not a true story. If lying is the latest trend in American pop culture (cf James Frey, Kaavya Viswanathan), then An American Haunting is on the cutting edge."
m/american_heart, It's time to recognize Mr. Bridges as the most underappreciated great actor of his generation.
m/american_heist," A run-of-the-mill crime drama that toes the risibility line on several occasions, even if it's better made than your typical straight-to-video movie."
m/american_history_x," Arrestingly photographed, and boasting another intelligent and muscular performance by the chameleon-like Edward Norton, American History X is good!"
m/american_honey," It's constantly, engrossingly active, spinning and sparking and exploding in cycles like a Fourth of July catherine wheel."
m/american_hustle, Russell turns the pursuit of the American dream into the ultimate escapism.
m/american_in_paris," The combination of Kelly's dance and charisma, Gershwin's music and Minneli's direction makes this a movie that's hugely enjoyable, even for those who don't generally look for movies that are packed with dancing."
m/american_jesus," You begin to find yourself wondering how this qualifies as an actual movie, as opposed to a mere travelogue to eccentricity. But then the hammer swings down."
m/american_made_2017," Liman, who has already established himself as an action-savvy filmmaker, handles the '80s tonal shift with deft assurance. And he is well-served by Cruise, who delivers his best performance in some time in the lead role."
m/american_mary_2012, A wickedly funny bout of body horror that also cuts deep.
m/american_me," It knows these worlds. The language, the clothes, the attitudes, are all shown with the understated conviction of a director who is sure of his material."
m/american_meat," Less sensationalist than its similarly themed predecessors, this informative documentary makes a strong case for the benefits of organic famring."
m/american_movie," Conveys the magic, the frustration, and the pressure of independent filmmaking."
m/american_outlaws," It fails because of a weak screenplay by Roderick Taylor and John Rogers and laden, lazy direction by Les Mayfield."
m/american_pastoral," McGregor swings for the fences in his portrayal of an anguished father, but the only thing he hits is an obnoxious metaphor about how the 60s killed America."
m/american_pie," Director Paul Weitz never quite pulls off the balancing act of There's Something About Mary, in which the Farrellys managed to be goofy and sweet and gross all at once."
m/american_pie_2, Screenwriter Adam Herz works with bodily discharges and fetishes the way a jazz musician handles melodies and instruments.
m/american_pop," Although cartoonish in the most pejorative sense, American Pop knows its musical lore. This film has little bits of tragedy that just may break your heart."
m/american_president," The image of a chief executive as moonstruck single guy taps something buoyant and touching in our collective democratic imagination. And Douglas, wearing a fast-break smile in place of his usual frown, strikes a tender rapport with Bening..."
m/american_promise," ...what this documentary perhaps concludes is that the American Promise lies not in the endless opportunities the country offers, but in the pact parents make with their children, to support them in whatever opportunity they happen to seize."
m/american_psycho," American Psycho is seamless in its inability to engage emotionally, message or no message."
m/american_radical, Paints an empathetic picture of a passionate Palestinian apologist as a loony loudmouth whose rants deserve respect if only because virtually all of his relatives were exterminated in the Holocaust.
m/american_relapse, How the revolving door of drug rehabilitation became big business.
m/american_renegades," Largely gung-ho nonsense, but it's always a pleasure to see J.K. Simmons in ball-busting mode, barking words like ""simpletons!"" at his men."
m/american_reunion_2012," Seann William Scott is the funniest movie comic of his generation, enlivening an otherwise copycat sequel."
m/american_rhapsody, A heartfelt movie; honest and straight from the heart.
m/american_satan, American Satan is a film it might take time for fans to discover but it will more than likely get a following in the next few years.
m/american_sniper," Like most recent era Clint Eastwood directed movies: good enough, but it could have been even more."
m/american_son_2019," An intimate, affecting dramatization of a nationwide crisis."
m/american_splendor," One of the most wildly original, dryly comical, and smartly structured films ever created."
m/american_swing, Interesting and concise documentary about the positive and destructive effects of casual sex.
m/american_tail," I liked it as a kid, and have liked it less and less every year since."
m/american_tail_fievel_goes_west, What can you say about a sequel that comes five years later and yet feels rushed?
m/american_teacher," A heartfelt, bittersweet portrait of several teachers as they make the difficult decision of whether to stick with the profession."
m/american_teen, American Teen is an enjoyable film but it does feel staged.
m/american_ultra," While Nourizadeh's just-for-fun head trip is no more ambitious than its long-haired pothead of a main character, it delivers on its sole goal: to entertain and to surprise."
m/american_violet," The narrative is infused with chilling facts, and the filmmakers know how to build their case, but a drama demands more."
m/american_wedding," In a way, ""American Wedding"" becomes a Stiffler of a film. INTERVIEW with Sean William Scott."
m/american_werewolf_in_london, Okay werewolf flick that's overproduced and tries too hard.
m/american_zombie," If you're looking for zombie horror, this is not the film for you (not enough gut-ripping and arm-chewing), but if you're looking for zombie fun, check it out."
m/americanization_of_emily," Although Julie Andrews is supposed to be playing a war widow, she's actually playing Mary Poppins."
m/americano_2011," It is wistful and nostalgic, and at the same time full of restless curiosity."
m/americas_heart_and_soul, Will appeal primarily to those who like their armchair adventures picture-postcard pristine and sprinkled with touches of proud self-sufficiency.
m/americas_sweethearts, Leaves you shaking your head over a lost opportunity to make a really great comedy.
m/amira_and_sam," Army vet turned filmmaker Mullin directs this Romeo and Juliet cross-cultural post-Iraq undocumented romance touching on his own daily round trip journey from Ground Zero by day to standup by night. And, a rarely seen spotlight on Arab women in movies."
m/amistad," Spielberg nearly capsizes the story with his customary emotional overkil...Still, the story of Cinque...and the rest of the Africans trying to get home is powerful."
m/amityville_2_the_possession," Let's take a real story and put some Exorcist effect in, yeah that's great"
m/amityville_horror, I'll go so far as to say that the new Amityville Horror is better than the original film -- a great example of just how effective genre filmmaking can be when it's done right.
m/amityville_the_awakening," Amityville: The Awakening is the kind of ""meta"" sequel that pokes fun of other franchise entries - saying 2005's remake ""blows"" - without ever recognizing its own place in (back of) the pack."
m/amityville_the_demon, a quickie cash-in on both the early '80s revitalized 3-D craze and the success of the previous two Amityville films
m/amnesiac_2015," ... feels too deliberate and calculated, as though it's a short-film concept stretched to feature length."
m/among_giants," As actors, Postlethwaite and Griffiths have the ability to evoke people it might be interesting to be, or know. The director, Sam Miller, uses this gift in unexpected ways."
m/among_wolves_2019," Smartly, Convey doesn't go out of his way to try to make the men overtly likable, but watching them try to come to terms with themselves, each other and their shared experiences does make for an ultimately engrossing film."
m/amores_perros," Iñárritu's characters are full of life and earthy flaws, and things that are too much for them to comprehend."
m/amos_and_andrew," Cage is the only actor allowed to do riffs on his assigned part, something he takes full advantage of; the others are stuck with their two-dimensional satirical profiles, which grow increasingly tiresome and unyielding."
m/amour_2013, An exceptional work shows a world-class director still unafraid to lock horns with the profound mysteries of the universe.
m/amour_fou," Inspired by the suicide of poet Heinrich von Kleist in 1811, Amour Fou... immerses the viewer in a long gone age. There is an attention to detail and manners that is quietly absorbing."
m/amulet," It's an impressive first feature, and while fans of zippy midnight movies might balk at its slow-burn opening act, the film eventually builds to some nutso body horror and a strong sense of mythology that announces Garai's arrival as a filmmaker to watch."
m/amy_2015, Masterfully chronicles the talent and tragedy of Amy Winehouse's short life.
m/amy_schumer_growing," Filmed in front of a packed house in Chicago, no topic is off limits - sex, her body, marriage and her husband, social norms, the #MeToo movement and empowerment."
m/amy_schumer_the_leather_special," Amy Schumer takes no prisoners in ""The Leather Special,"" an hour of hilarious, raunchy comedy..."
m/an_acceptable_loss," What could have explored the real complexities behind a serious issue instead became a self-congratulatory pat on the back for holding a specific viewpoint, and a boring one at that."
m/an_actor_prepares," A witty road trip with detours and performances that know when to push and when to retreat. Irons has great fun as lecherous, scarf-flapping thespian Atticus, with Huston a good counterweight as his po-faced, mansplaining feminist son."
m/an_affair_of_the_heart, Minor curio about Rick Springfield's devoted fan base has less weight than a VH1 Behind the Music special.
m/an_alan_smithee_film_burn_hollywood_burn," Widely panned as one of the worst movies ever made, life imitated art when director Arthur Hiller took his name off this train wreck and used... of course... Alan Smithee."
m/an_american_carol," Is there any filmmaker alive, whether Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal, capable of producing a truly incisive, intelligent satire about our politically polarized times?"
m/an_autumn_afternoon_1964, Such a completely realized example of the Ozu art that it seems impossible he did not intend it to be a kind of testament.
m/an_education," An Education works as a fever dream of first love, but the wake-up is unsatisfying."
m/an_encounter_with_simone_weil," A creative and compelling documentary about Simone Weil, a French philosopher, activist, and mystic whom writer Albert Camus called the only great spirit of our time."
m/an_evening_with_beverly_luff_linn_2018," Hosking's latest tests the audience's patience with frustratingly unfunny scenarios and an array of nasty, angry characters doing unpleasant things."
m/an_inconvenient_sequel_truth_to_power," Less impactful than the original, but a much needed word of encouragement for those who've taken up Gore's challenge."
m/an_interview_with_god, The biblical teachings remain in view while other kinds of questions have no answer. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/an_invisible_sign," A soupy, entirely unconvincing grab bag of unmotivated behaviors and unearned emotional payoffs, An Invisible Sign feels like part of some woebegone, misguided stab at indie credibility and image adjustment for Jessica Alba."
m/an_ordinary_man," There's sophistication in the study of guilt and emotional isolation, but the feature is alarmingly simple and repetitive, with Silberling laboring to fill his effort with anything that could inflate the material into something substantial."
m/an_oversimplification_of_her_beauty_2012, Incredibly heartfelt and sincere and urgent... It is the film that it is because it is sloppy and rough.
m/anaconda," An opening title informs us that anacondas will sometimes regurgitate their victims, just to have the pleasure of devouring them again: Yes, friends, prepare for the awesome spectacle of a vomiting giant serpent!"
m/anacondas_the_hunt_for_the_blood_orchid, I suppose it could have been worse: it could have been longer.
m/analyze_that," Worst of all (it) actually tries to jerk some tears with...maudlin soft-focus flashbacks of a happy childhood for De Niro's mafioso. Oh, puh-leaze!"
m/analyze_this," The movie never rises above trite and obvious gags: bodies in car trunks, lunkhead henchmen, idiot feds with their wires crossed."
m/anamorph," Though this snuff flick takes its title from an asexual stage of reproduction in the life of a fungus, don't expect to find any fungi, I mean fun guys, in this lame excuse for graphic displays of vivisection."
m/anarchist_cookbook," he film aims to be thought-provoking and funny, but this reviewer only laughed twice, and was only provoked into one thought: How do you go from The Deer Hunter to this?"
m/anarchy," ""Cymbeline"" has been teleported from the past with its fundamental problems unaddressed, and as soon as Google does a redesign or the next gen iPhone comes out, it's going to look as anachronistic as Ed Harris' tragic leather jacket."
m/anatomy-of-a-murder," All the principals are fantastic, with the possible exception of Remick, who just doesn't fit the part nearly well enough. Duke Ellington's score is a classic."
m/anatomy_2," Where the first film was something of a teen horror film, the follow-up, again from writer-director Stefan Ruzowitzky, is more of an unintentional comedy."
m/anchor_and_hope," The characters are so vivid that they can't help but catch the audience's sympathies, even if the story sometimes drags."
m/anchorman," Ferrell has seized on a clever concept rife with possibilities -- namely, women breaking the glass ceiling in male-dominated TV news during the '70s -- and smartly surrounded himself with a topnotch cast."
m/anchorman_2_the_legend_continues," It's bawdy, on-target in its take on what's become of TV news, and packed with wacky performers."
m/and_everything_is_going_fine," A documentary look at Gray's life told by, who else, Spalding Gray. It's only fitting that that his life is told in his own words"
m/and_now_a_word_from_our_sponsor_2012," This insipid, fraudulent Canadian comedy smells like a 30-year-old screenplay somebody found in the CAA commissary under a short chair leg."
m/and_now_for_something_completely_different," If you know this material, you know it well; if you don't, you're in for a bizarre surprise as these six gifted men -- in their youthful glory -- blend the surreal and the scatological, the high with the low, manufacturing oddly brilliant comedy."
m/and_now_ladies_and_gentlemen, This sophisticated love story blows most Hollywood romances out of the water.
m/and_so_it_goes," Despite the utter predictability of the plot, the picture wins you over. It starts off clumsily but grows more engaging as it continues."
m/and_soon_the_darkness_2010," While not terribly original, ""And Soon the Darkness"" is an entertaining film that, within genre confines, delivers exactly what it promises-tension, suspense, and a story that catches and holds your attention throughout."
m/and_the_band_played_on, I enjoyed seeing A-list actors in the sort of small supporting role they would never otherwise accept. And they got the film made.
m/and_then_came_love," Entertaining enough as a mildly amusing diversion, even if it might deliver a dubious message to impressionable teenage girls torn between dating a nerdy nice guy and a loser without much of a future."
m/and_then_there_were_none, The best of the numerous screen versions that have made their way to movie theaters over the years.
m/and_then_we_danced," The narrative becomes both more melodramatic and erratic, with numerous subplots suddenly vying for attention and an overdose of plot getting in the way of proper characterization."
m/and_while_we_were_here," Unfortunately, this tale of an illicit romance between an unhappily married woman and a younger man traffics in far too many genre clichs, beginning with its idyllic locale."
m/anderson_tapes," I am full of admiration for the superb pacing, the tactful understatement of the location shooting, the sharp feel of the city."
m/andre_gregory_before_and_after_dinner," Although Andre Gregory's fans will find much here to savor, this rambling and unfocused portrait smacks of self-indulgence."
m/andrew-dice-clay-dice-rules," To those of us who suffered through his brief moment in the spotlight, it's such a relief to say it: Andrew Dice who?"
m/andromeda_strain," The ending is arguably a bit too neat, but works nevertheless."
m/andy_warhols_frankenstein," Morrissey's grotesque, ravishing film situates the Frankenstein story squarely in the world of the Freudian uncanny."
m/anesthesia," I wanted more time with almost all of the subplots - I got invested in their small, relatable agonies - which is both a complaint and a compliment."
m/angel_at_my_table, Campion's knack for solitary yet paradoxically epic scope nibbles off Laura Jones's bite-sized scene-sketches of loneliness and makes entire meals of them.
m/angel_has_fallen," If going through a checklist of action film clichés were a competitive sport, Angel Has Fallen would be the all-time world champion."
m/angel_of_evil," Engaging, energetic gangster thriller-slash-biopic with a charismatic central performance from Kim Rossi Stuart, though the pacy direction means that the film is often frustratingly light on context and detail."
m/angel_of_mine_2019," Well-acted, but terribly predictable -- even it's ""surprises"" have take a gutless turn."
m/angela-2007," The whole film's easy on the eye thanks to the Parisian summer setting, photographed in creamy black and white. If only the romance wasn't so monochrome too..."
m/angelas_ashes," Despite its harsh scenes, Angela's Ashes will leave you with lovely memories."
m/angelfish_2019," Destiny Frasqueri (better known to her Generation Z fans as Nuyorican rapper Princess Nokia) makes a winning, delicate screen debut in ""Angelfish,"" a low-key Bronx romance that proves a surprisingly muted vehicle for her outsize performing charisma."
m/angels_crest_2011, The main story remains intriguing even if it never becomes profound.
m/angels_in_the_dust," ...Angels in the Dust is an important, enormously emotional film that will hopefully have a far-reaching and valuable impact on the plight of Sub-Saharan AIDS."
m/angels_wear_white," [Vivian] Qu keeps the camera at the height of her two young female protagonists, effectively creating empathy with these young women whose feelings are too easily ignored by the people around them."
m/angels_with_dirty_faces," Rocky Sullivan is riveting. His movements are quick and vital, his speech like machine-gun fire, his demeanor sharp and confident. He is all attitude and style."
m/angie," Updated version of the simplistic working class sagas Hollywood used to make in the 1950s (Marty), except that the protag is an ethnic minority female, miscast by the glorious and beautiful Geena Davis; showing promise, Gandolfini may become a lead actor"
m/angry_red_planet, Very bad special effects mar this only-average s-f excursion. Only the giant rat-bat-whatever creature has any flair.
m/anguish_2015," This is a horror movie that starts with characters and then moves to scares, a rare thing these days, and because we do care for these characters so much, it's that much more terrifying when their very souls are at stake."
m/angus," ""Angus"" is aimed at young audiences who will identify with his insecurities. But it's a fine little film for anybody who likes a heartwarming glimpse at where resolve can take forlorn people."
m/angus_thongs_and_perfect_snogging," The film lacks the wit and drama that might pitch it beyond the target demographic, though judging from what makes the girls squirm in the film, it might not succeed even there."
m/aniara, Never establishes a coherent intellectual vantage point from which to contemplate the monumentality of the eternal void. It's a film that wants to be visionary but isn't.
m/anima_2019," The most perfect visualization to date of Yorke's music, ""ANIMA"" finds a way to tunnel out and escape from the oppressiveness that people tend to associate with the slippery rock star."
m/animal_2014," A healthy amalgam of ""The Descent"" and ""Feast,"" with a hint of ""Night of the Living Dead."""
m/animal_factory," Where Darabont's drama is an overlong 142 minutes, Buscemi's is a just-right 94, and where Shawshank is predictable, Animal Factory surprises."
m/animal_farm," This is the first feature-length animated cartoon to tackle an adult theme instead of the usual kindergarten slapstick. A British effort, it sometimes fails to compete with Hollywood's best technical standards."
m/animal_kingdom," This could have been a slick little thriller. Instead, it evolves into the unfolding of an epic tragedy."
m/animals_2014, It is a character study that reminds me of the first time I saw Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy. And it could eventually herald the arrival of as important a talent.
m/animals_united, If you kitted Al Gore out in a furry animal costume and put him on a soapbox you'd have a rough idea of the environmental message trumpeted in this harmless kids' fare.
m/animation_outlaws, A dizzying mix of talking heads and eye-candy toon clips enliven this whirlwind history of Spike & Mike's Festival of Animation.
m/animatrix, This particular 'rabbit hole' has far more verve and artistic curiousity than its bloated blockbuster counterpart [i]The Matrix Reloaded[/i]
m/anna_2019, To describe the plot in much more detail would take away that rare and wonderful thing that so many action films sorely lack: fun.
m/anna_and_the_apocalypse," Slick and stylish, with moments of gore that are played for gross-out and laughs in equal measure. You will hum along, you will tap your toes, if you're a big softy like me, you'll cry, but you will definitely have a great time."
m/anna_karenina_2012," If it doesn't ultimately engage your heart as it might, Anna Karenina is period drama at its most exciting, intoxicating and modern. Spellbinding."
m/annabelle," More stupefying than scary, Annabelle takes whatever promise there was of a Conjuring franchise and flushes it down the bowels of Hell with its uninspired direction and wooden performances."
m/annabelle_comes_home," Unlike previous films, where the human cast was at best a side-aspect of the scares and at worst completely disposable, each character in Annabelle Comes Home feels genuine and fleshed out."
m/annabelle_creation," Sandberg demonstrates a deft affinity for the elaboration of horror conventions, as well as the expansion of the Conjuring universe."
m/annapolis," If the powers behind this pasteboard mockup of a film wanted to remake AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, why didn't they just go ahead and do that? . . . [I]f they wanted to remake ROCKY, why didn't they just go ahead and do that?"
m/anne_frank_remembered," Anne's story of courage in the face of horrendous circumstances is a fine legacy, and Anne Frank Remembered reaffirms how relevant her message is today."
m/anne_of_the_thousand_days," It's about what you'd expect -- slow, dry, fleetingly intelligent."
m/annie_1981, There's bad and then there's bad and then there's Annie
m/annie_2012," Think you've got a hard-knock life? Try sitting through the new ""Annie."""
m/annie_hall," Just when you feel like you want to look away, it brings you back with a devastating one-liner."
m/annihilation, Garland's riveting interpretation of the novel is a consciousness-altering trip that will alter audiences on a cellular and molecular level.
m/anniversary_party, Such an array of acting talent is trapped in such a mess of a movie.
m/anomalisa," The delightfully downcast and sometimes masterful ""Anomalisa"" proves there is more than one way to skin a similar cat, and the unbearable darkness of being can still radiate glimmers of beauty."
m/anon," It's an amiable thriller that will definitely account for an enjoyable couple of hours in the lives of Netflix subscribers, though it likely won't leave the same impact as Niccol's best work."
m/anonymous_2011," Emmerich takes the story at face value and delivers a film unlike any of his others. That is to say, a boring one."
m/another," Cinematographed within an inch of its life (and death), ""Mark of the Witch"" (aka ""Another"") would have worked beautifully as a silent picture."
m/another_48_hrs," On it's own it's entertaining. As a sequel, it's dissapointing."
m/another_country," Elegantly shot, this fictionalized version of the British gay spy Guy Burgess, is intelligent but not entirely satisfying; even so, the young Rupert Everett and Colin Firth give splendid performances."
m/another_day_in_paradise_1997," [Clark's] second, more benign film delivers what his first promised: bad times with a wicked way of looking good."
m/another_earth, A resolutely small parable of grief that often feels menaced by its big-idea concept.
m/another_gay_movie," Move over, American Pie and Road Trip: There's a new sheriff in town, and he's wearing leather chaps."
m/another_gay_sequel," Includes clever references to the straight raunchfests Porky's and American Pie. But his film feels more like a collection of skits than a cohesive story. His characters aren't even half-dimensional and, except for Nico, are boorish bores."
m/another_happy_day," A movie about a wedding that makes you wish you'd checked the ""Regrets only"" section of this particular invitation."
m/another_stakeout, Plays more like National Lampoon's Seattle Vacation than a sly comedy/drama about undercover cops.
m/another_thin_man," The atmosphere and sets, along with stellar performances by the principals, can't offset a weak story."
m/another_wolfcop," ...a groovy movie full of guts, gore, and dick jokes..."
m/another_woman," Sometimes emotionally disengaging, but generally an intelligent Bergman-esque study of one woman's quest for fulfillment."
m/another_year_2010," [Leigh has] made another funny, perceptive, moving human drama."
m/answer_man," For those seeking smart, sharp, witty, indie filmmaking here's your answer."
m/answers_to_nothing," Even in the best ensembles, there's always a weak character, someone we're relieved to get away from so that we can get back to the people who interest us. Here, we can't wait to get away from pretty much all of them."
m/ant_bully, The animated version feels anonymously generic and charmlessly mechanical.
m/ant_man_and_the_wasp, Ant-Man and the Wasp is undoubtedly a laugh-out-loud blockbuster superhero movie that will entertain audiences and provide a much-needed break to all the drama happening elsewhere in the Marvel Universe after Avengers: Infinity War.
m/antarctica_a_year_on_ice, Gorgeous nature shots are in the mix with barely visible takes of pummeling storms and mundane hangouts.
m/antarctica_ice_and_sky_2017, There is something interestingly non-argumentative and personal about this documentary.
m/antboy, ...a mostly bland but very kid-friendly Spider-Man clone.
m/antebellum," Its needless brutality, ropy character work, and misguided twist make it easily 2020's worst movie so far."
m/anthony_jeselnik_fire_in_the_maternity_ward," Then, just as you're about to rise up in fury, you realize that with sneakily self-immolating deftness, all of Jeselnik's most devastating hits land squarely on himself."
m/anthony_jeselnik_thoughts_and_prayers," If you're feeling the need to laugh and feel slightly terrible about yourself, then Thoughts and Prayers is the comedy special for you."
m/anthropoid, Director Sean Ellis's film offers a potent examination of the moral rectitude of resistance.
m/anti_matter," Despite its daft premise, Anti Matter offers a cerebral and intelligent take on what is a genre perennial: something going amiss in a newly-developed matter transporter."
m/antibirth," Antibirth has so many moments that flash what Danny Perez is capable of, but none of them come together in the end."
m/antiquities," A smartly observed film with a sweet centre, Antiquities takes old themes and polishes them up until they shine."
m/antisocial," If you can get past the fact that the flick is composed of 75% recycled ideas and 25% new ones, you may find that something to like."
m/antitrust, Succeeds in making its portentous meaning more than reasonably entertaining.
m/antiviral," For Cronenberg fans, the prodigal son's debut will be a revivalist bodyshock gem, and for everyone else, it'll seem more than a little weird."
m/antman," Even the jokes that do work leave some laughs on the table, and the impulse to play things safe proves emblematic of a film that shrinks in the face of a challenge."
m/anton_chekhovs_the_duel," The performers clearly relish these lines, and Scott, simultaneously feral, manic and despondent, is a particular standout."
m/antonias_line, Gorris has fashioned a rare and wonderful world capable of provoking both laughter and tears -- sometimes at the same time.
m/antonio_gaudi_1986," Another key to Teshigahara's success is the haunting score by Toru Takemitsu, which conjures up Gaudi's storybook grandeur."
m/antrum_the_deadliest_film_ever_made," Antrum is pure folk horror eeriness, right down to the brilliantly off kilter score, and has the potential to be a major cult hit, given its ingenious hook."
m/ants_on_a_shrimp," Like a well-executed fine-dining experience, this sleek documentary entertains, delights, and makes viewers comfortable without evident sweat."
m/antwone_fisher, Washington has a successful if modest debut film under his belt.
m/antz," A Woody Allen movie, with all the adult laughs, esteem issues and other accouterments that come with it, and a great kiddie flick, complete with the requisite warm and fuzzy character-building lessons."
m/anvil_the_story_of_anvil," Very entertaining docu is amusing without being condescending, touching without straining for pathos."
m/any_day," A well-intentioned disaster, only slightly redeemed by a committed performance by Sean Bean, whose talent proves nowhere near enough to make this manipulative tripe more digestible."
m/any_day_now_2012," Depictions of custody battles have become a cinematic staple, but few register with the heartfelt emotion of Any Day Now."
m/any_given_sunday," For those interested in football as more than a game, as a cultural event, Stone's film falls short of any meaningful exploration."
m/any_number_can_play," Clark Gable could have played in his sleep his part in this verbose Mervyn LeRoy's family melodrama, set almost entirely within a casino."
m/anya_2019," Anya may be small in budget, but it is big in humanity, intelligence and emotional impact"
m/anything_but_love, This is a micro-budgeted tribute to Hollywood musicals of the '40s and '50s that's all the more endearing for its flaws.
m/anything_else, Anything Else simply dresses its young stars up like over-the-hill geeks and stuffs their mouths with ten-dollar words.
m/anywhere_but_here, A wryly observed mother-daughter drama that earns its laughs -- and tears -- the old-fashioned way.
m/apache," Burt Lancaster joins a long line of white actors who played native Americans in this brutal Western, directed by the young Robert Aldrich, who was forced to change the ending."
m/aparajito," Standing above fashion, it creates a world so convincing that it becomes, for a time, another life we might have lived."
m/apocalypse_now, Apocalypse Now delivers one of the best character studies in the history of the medium.
m/apocalypse_now_final_cut, Apocalypse Now finds its triumph in restating the inhumanity of empire.
m/apocalypse_now_redux_2001," Does Apocalypse Now need a new, longer cut? No. Is the original inexplicably improved with one? Somehow, yes."
m/apocalypto," It isn't merely fascinating, it is nothing less than one of the very best movies of the year, and it contains some of the best foot chases in cinematic history."
m/apollo_11_2019," The pristine images, taken from long buried government storage, take us from the launch pad to splashdown."
m/apollo_13," A powerful story, one of the year's best films, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail, and acted without pumped-up histrionics."
m/apollo_18," Reconfirms that most entries in the ""found-footage"" horror subgenre should remain lost."
m/apostle," Duvall is very convincing and even sympathetic, despite the demanding nature of the role."
m/apostle_2018," Evans serves up a wicked thriller with piercing visuals and a slight spin to the cult horror genre that perhaps unlike religion, I doubt viewers will want to abandon."
m/apple_dumpling_gang," The traditional ingredients of homely moralising, sentimentality and raucous slapstick are used sparingly, the dialogue is fairly bright, some visual gags are neatly executed."
m/applesauce," Applesauce mixes genres (here, a revenge fantasy meets a relationship drama) to create a brightly amusing catalogue of stupid human tricks that doesn't fit neatly into any niche."
m/apprenticeship_of_duddy_kravitz," It's a little too sloppy, and occasionally too obvious, to qualify as a great film, but it's a good and entertaining one, and it leaves us thinking that Duddy Kravitz might amount to something after all, should he ever grow up."
m/approaching_the_unknown," In its own compact, budget-conscious way, it's quite a stirring if low-key journey."
m/appropriate_behavior," The slender, seemingly autobiographical film has its share of neurotic charms and funny one-liners, but it's too tentative about digging into its identity conflicts -- sexual or cultural."
m/apres_vous," While it basically reuses all of the conventions of a typical French romantic farce, it does so with winning aplomb."
m/april_and_the_extraordinary_world_2016, Animation should push boundaries and this aesthetic and revisionist plot do exactly that.
m/aprils_shower," The film has a pleasant spirit and lively dialogue, and what's more, seems to be coming from a specific cultural and geographical location."
m/apt_pupil, Apt Pupil is about as great as a modern Stephen King horror flick could get.
m/aqua_teen_hunger_force_colon_movie_film_for_theatres, Succeed[s] enough of the time to make a perversely entertaining movie.
m/aquamarine," Aquamarine is a frothy, cute feature film that (for at least a good 70 minutes) should be painless for adults, and manna from heaven to girls."
m/aquaslash, Sporadic laughs and a mercifully brief length aren't enough to compensate for a disappointing lack of aquatic slashing.
m/arachnophobia," It gives you the willies in a cheery, presentable way."
m/arbitrage," Jarecki invests his film with a great sense of pacing and tension. It's a well-crafted plot, effortlessly juggling financial and family drama, with a Colombo-esque complication nipping at its heels."
m/archipelago, No other British director is making films quite like this.
m/architect, An award-winning architect finds himself pitted against a resident who has to live in one of his deteriorating housing blocks in Chicago in Matt Tauber's thoughtful second feature.
m/archive," A slick, moody sci-fi mashup, a thoughtful thriller cobbled together from a lot of better films that came before it."
m/arctic_2019," Here is a gripping and efficient addition to the rugged survivalist thriller genre, a realm where men are men and howling lamentations at the unforgiving sky is seen as entirely acceptable behaviour."
m/arctic_tale," 'Arctic Tale,' a cuddly family film touching on the dangers of claw and fang, contains a global warming caution. Without whining its alarm, the movie quietly incorporates it."
m/are_we_done_yet," What makes Are We Done Yet? so shoddy isn't its likeable star's now-familiar cuddly-bear persona, but the fact that the film could easily pass for another entry in the Cheaper by the Dozen franchise."
m/are_you_here," Not really all that funny, and not all that touching, but if you are a fan of the cast it might be worth a rental."
m/argo_2012," Kudos to Ben Affleck, actor and director, for delivering a vital and thrilling political actioner."
m/aria, So diverse in nature that it can only be evaluated piecemeal
m/aristide_and_the_endless_revolution, Aristide and the Endless Revolution is a probing look into the 2004 overthrow of the twice democratically elected Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide ...
m/aristocats," It's a happy, all singing, very cute and well told tale that will keep the kiddies enthralled while lightening a few older hearts."
m/aristocrats, It's funny and it makes you think; isn't that the definition of a good joke?
m/arizona_2018," Arizona isn't quite the comedy you might expect, but it makes a worthy trade as a quirky survival story with some social commentary thrown in as well, due to its very pronounced housing-crisis setting."
m/arizona_dream," You can't stop watching because nobody in the audience, and possibly nobody on the screen, has any idea what's going to happen next."
m/arkansas," Most of ""Arkansas""... just falls flat, despite individual scenes here and there that work."
m/arlington_road," Builds at a snowball pitch: slow at first, and then bigger and tighter and faster, so you don't even realize what's happening until it overwhelms you."
m/armadillo_2010," This is gritty, engaging, smart, gorgeously shot, an intimate epic. Armadillo is simply an extraordinary feat of filmmaking and another masterpiece from the film minds in Denmark."
m/armageddon, You know you're in trouble when Deep Impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope.
m/arme_riddere, It is a savagely funny and brutally stylish pulp thriller that will impress fans of the genre.
m/armed_response_2017, Low-budget high-tech thriller pits grunts against a supercomputer run amok in this too-familiar tale of man against machine.
m/armored," Inspired by Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs and countless films about seemingly perfect heists that go uproariously wrong, Armored is an unpretentious, fast-moving, action-packed thriller but emotionally hollow."
m/armstrong_2019," David Fairhead's portrait of Neil Armstrong has a slightly less demonstrative hero, but still finds examples of his genial nature."
m/army_of_crime, Compelling performances and beautifully told heroics but the pacing is flawed in terms of a thrilling cinematic experience.
m/army_of_darkness," A bloody and fairly lifeless witch's brew of medievalism, Jonathan Swift and the Three Stooges."
m/army_of_one_2016, The biggest draw is watching Cage embrace a character with the unironic comedic flair we haven't seen from him in quite some time.
m/army_of_shadows, The action is tense. Dark shadows and long moody silences predominate. The dialogue is clipped and sparse: Melville's heroes are men and women of few words and big deeds.
m/around_the_bend, Years of tinkering have left a residue of predictability -- a forced feeling of familial bonding burdened with an air of determined idiosyncrasy.
m/around_the_block," There are no false notes here, and there is no whitewash, either (if you'll pardon the expression); it's a good story well told and beautifully performed, supported by a contempo soundtrack and seamless design. Australian cinema at its be"
m/around_the_sun," In the end, I have a great deal of admiration for the final product."
m/around_the_world_in_80_days," This comic riff on the Verne classic loses altitude as it proceeds, closing with a crash landing in more ways than one."
m/aroused," It has an inviting softness, but the background music, odd camera angles, close-ups and lingering shots only distract and objectify."
m/arq," A futuristic movie that is entertaining, but not memorable and ends being disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/arranged," Precise lensing, a strong sense of locale and vibrant, eminently likeable perfs enliven Arranged."
m/arrival_2016," Arrival gives us a lot to take in, and the picture is big, somber and grand, if in the end somewhat sterile."
m/arsenal_2017, A muddy and unappealing revenge flick miscast from top-to-bottom.
m/arsenic_and_old_lace," Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) is a frenzied, hilarious, madcap black comedy from celebrated director Frank Capra. The slapstick film, with murderous aunts compassionately serving up elderberry wine to elderly gentlemen - with their crazy nephew..."
m/art_and_craft," ...Art And Craft is a intriguing depiction of counterfeit impulses (both wrongly perceived and irrepressible), immense talent gone awry and what lies behind the desire to create."
m/art_isthe_permanent_revolution," Put succinctly, this is the greatest film ever made dealing with the connection between art and radical politics."
m/art_of_being_straight," The director's inexperience shows at times...but his writing and acting are fine. Indeed, everyone in the cast is quite good."
m/art_of_the_steal," A fascinating, if overlong, look at a legacy perverted."
m/art_school_confidential," [The film] feels insubstantial, echoing without equaling both the coolly ironic edge and heart of Ghost World."
m/arthur_2011," The original Arthur was a mediocre film with a few laughs, not a classic. It looks like the model of wit compared to the remake that waddles into theaters this week."
m/arthur_2_on_the_rocks," It decides that Arthur must grow, must rise to an occasion, must for once take responsibility for his life. This is very good for Arthur, but not so good for the film."
m/arthur_christmas, This simultaneously cool and cosy tale of families and Christmas spirit will have Aardman's pockets jingling all the way to the bank. And deservedly so.
m/arthur_miller_writer," She interviewed [her father] for decades...Adds personal and archival photographs, home movies, and talks with relatives and friends, this is a warm and intimate reflection."
m/arthur_newman, You'll soon wish the film were about someone a bit more exciting ...
m/article_99, Scores some good points with its moral condemnation of an institution that puts saving money ahead of saving lives.
m/artik," Brutal and original, Artik is an existential study of violence and cruelty that's an essential watch for horror fans."
m/as_aboveso_below," A suitably tense chiller that delivers the requisite shocks and scares, though slightly overplays its hand in the middle section."
m/as_cool_as_i_am_2013," Simplistic plotting, pedestrian visuals and poorly-handled melodrama do lend the project a cheap, made-for-TV feel, which is underscored by the fact that Danes and Marsden don't seem obliged to turn in their best work."
m/as_good_as_it_gets, Ties each of its loose ends into a neat little bow.
m/as_i_lay_dying_2013," Ultimately, As I Lay Dying is another Franco lark that is more of an experiment with form than a fully realized movie."
m/as_if_i_am_not_there_2011," Impressively directed and superbly shot, this is an emotionally powerful, harrowing drama with a terrific performance from newcomer Natasha Petrovic."
m/ash_is_purest_white, [A] film with powerful images and [an] unpredictable evolution. [Full review in Spanish]
m/ash_wednesday_1973," This is not a male chauvinist's conception of a woman, but her hairdresser's, full of envy, awe and superficial compassion."
m/ashby," ""Ashby"" is engaging enough, and features strong performances by Rourke and Roberts, but it's not a film that will linger on the mind for very long."
m/asher, [director Michael] Caton-Jones's ASHER is as much a contemplative look at being aged out of life as it is recognizing that sometimes we must break out of our ruts to get more.
m/ashes_and_diamonds," Wajda tends toward harsh and overstated imagery, but he achieves a fascinating psychological rapport with his lead actor, Zbigniew Cybulski."
m/ashes_in_the_snow, The film is heartfelt and often powerful but sometimes too sluggish to carry maximum impact.
m/ashes_of_time_redux_2008, Despite the boom in Asian cinema since its first release Ashes of Time Redux is quite simply one of the best films of the year.
m/ask_no_questions, It is the humanity of the filmmakers and their obvious exasperation at the audacity of the Chinese government that makes the film work as well as it does.
m/ask_the_dust, Towne draws out the era's rampant poverty and ethnic divisions through a story that plays to his strengths as a writer and a romantic
m/asoka, This enthralling film deserves to realise Indian producers' longstanding dream of reaching an international audience.
m/asphalt_jungle," One of the first films to depict crime from the POV of the deviants rather than the police, this seminal film (arguably Huston's best) had a huge influence on the genre, manifest in the early work of Kubrick--and decades later Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs"
m/ass_backwards_2013, This is a feature that opens and closes with shots of women urinating. No amount of high-beam comedic work is going save a picture that doesn't have much imagination to begin with.
m/assassination_bureau," A cinematic curio, but also a delightful souvenir of the 60s."
m/assassination_nation, That of-the-minute aesthetic makes Annihilation Nation frequently cathartic.
m/assassination_of_a_high_school_president," Depending on your personal taste, the following statement may make or break Assassination for you: the movie is cute."
m/assassination_of_jesse_james_by_the_coward_robert_ford," The titular act of violence is the best scene in the film, radiating a kind of unavoidable fatality that elevates the lethal gunshot from a just another bang to something triggering a very strong sense of epochal change."
m/assassination_tango, Robert Duvall should have stuck to the tango because the hit man aspect misses the target.
m/assassins, A rather simple story with dollops of gripping action.
m/assassins_bullet_2012," The cockeyed C-quality B movie, shot on location with a Balkan supporting cast and crew, mixes a precarious pileup of visual clichs with over-staged action sequences."
m/assassins_creed," Assassin's Creed is very confusing. No, scratch that: It's a mess."
m/assault_of_the_killer_bimbos," You buy a movie with a title like this, you pretty much get what you deserve."
m/assault_on_precinct_13, A textbook example of why the odds of finding a good genre film are currently about equal to those of winning the lottery.
m/assault_on_wall_street_2013," Boll spends so much time painting Jim into the corner required to ""justify"" his bonkers actions that once the film's fuse is irrevocably lighted, viewers may have already checked out."
m/assaulted_civil_rights_under_fire," While the film leans more heavily toward pro-gun ownership, finessing that position with a nod toward left-leaning politics, its real purpose is to bring some historical perspective to the argument, to move the conversation beyond emotion-based rhetoric."
m/assisted_living, Features a crackerjack performance from Michael Bonsignore as a nursing home slacker with heart.
m/astro_boy," The symbolism and the underlying themes within this story may not be relevant to its core audience, but it's interesting to see how filmmakers feed off those elements"
m/astronaut_2019," This is a film that really will appeal to viewers of all ages, and that doesn't lose sight of the dream."
m/astronaut_farmer, Plays too much like an Ayn Rand novel and not enough like October Sky.
m/astronauts_wife," Houston, we have a problem. It's called The Astronaut's Wife."
m/asylum2005, An intense and haunting drama with four memorable performances
m/at_any_price_2012," Given real struggles to convey, Quaid delivers some of his finest acting in the movie's closing scenes, his furrowed brow pointing to a pair of focused eyes that say a lot more than the script's rampant issue-based dialogue."
m/at_close_range," If you like your drama dark and your taste in acting favours the credible-looking but verbally challenged Sean Penn, then you'll likely find At Close Range an interesting movie choice."
m/at_eternitys_gate," An unbridled portrait of the painful but productive final years in the life of Vincent van Gogh, a role inhabited with the acrid lucidity of madness by Willem Dafoe."
m/at_first_light," Stone's movie is one of the most frustrating kinds to run into while covering a festival comprised of upcoming filmmakers, the calling card project."
m/at_middleton, What starts out mildly charming is mostly tiresome by the time they start doing bong rips in a random student's dorm room.
m/at_the_devils_door," An accumulation of dread in search of a properly fleshed-out screenplay to sustain it, the film plays like a show reel for writer-director Nicholas McCarthy's considerable craft."
m/at_the_earths_core," As low budget creature features go, this one's good fun."
m/atanarjuat_the_fast_runner_2002," Atanarjuat will make you laugh, make you cry and keep you on the edge of your seat for nearly three hours. Isn't that what cinema was supposed to do all along?"
m/atl," Despite a few pitfalls (the adult worlds of money and sex) ATL makes navigating the trials, tribulations, and Southern twangs of life on the wrong side of the tracks look relatively painless."
m/atlantic_city," [It] may be one of the most romantic and perverse ghost stories ever filmed, set not in a haunted castle but in a haunted city..."
m/atlantics, The strength of Atlantique lies in the fact that this social fable is transformed into a tale of ghosts and revolt. [Full review in Spanish]
m/atlantis_the_lost_empire," While far from ideal, Atlantis is a good adventure film with at least some of the nostalgic feel of classic exploration films."
m/atlas_shrugged_part_i," Ayn Rand's monumental 1,168-page, 1957 novel gets the low-budget, no-talent treatment and sits there flapping on screen like a bludgeoned seal."
m/atlas_shrugged_part_ii," The people behind the Atlas Shrugged series of films have things they want to tell you, and just to make sure that you know what they are, the movies tell you, and tell you, and then tell you again."
m/atlas_shrugged_who_is_john_galt," In 1949, when Warner Bros. filmed The Fountainhead, Rand threatened to burn down the studio if they compromised her novel. I'd like to think that if she were alive she'd be looking for lighter fluid for this one."
m/atm," While ""ATM"" does offer a few jolts, we're paired with bland characters and an underrealized premise."
m/atomic_blonde_2017," Given that the film gives us ample time to catch our breath in-between the punching, kicking and shooting it will be easier to wish that it had all been condensed into an accessible YouTube video of just the action bits."
m/atomic_cafe, The Atomic Cafe captures the Atomic Age and the resulting Cold War better than any documentary
m/atonement, The uncertainty of how events will unfold is riveting.
m/atrocious," The scares - though effective, even chilling - come in scarce fits and starts..."
m/attack_of_the_lederhosen_zombies," The acting is wooden and the special effects aren't all that special, but it's a spirited effort and doesn't drag during its 78 minutes."
m/attack_on_titan_part_2," When the action finally does resume, the climactic battle resembles [a not-too-expensive] episode of Ultraman, as men in rubber suits duke it out against miniature sets and green-screen FX."
m/attack_the_block, Employs a terse set-up and sparse characterisations to rein in any sentimentality and stress the ambiguities of its rich political and allegorical depths.
m/attenberg_2010," Attenberg is distinguished aesthetically by cinematographer Thimios Bakatakis eye for both the beauty of coastal Greece and the hideousness of its mineral factories, conveying, like the film itself, the life-giving and life-taking moments in our lifetimes."
m/attraction," Fails to capitalize on the fact that it will be found in the ""thriller"" bin at any video store."
m/attraction_2017," What could have been an interesting science fiction film with political and social criticism ends up becoming a kind of Twlight-like film, which involves one of the most forced romances I've seen on the big screen. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/audience-of-one," I'm still recommending it, mainly because of the great story it hints at and for the way it genuinely captures the excitement and heartbreak of filmmaking."
m/audition_1999, A harrowing account of a woman's revenge with one of the most graphic torture scenes yet filmed.
m/audrey_rose," The skillful direction of Robert Wise supplies ample suspense, which is not easy because there can be no screaming scenes while the dialogue and explanations are taking place."
m/audrie_and_daisy, This powerful doc chronicles the dismally unjust aftermaths of two recent juvenile sexual-assault cases in the U.S.
m/auggie," It's a strong feature-length debut from actor Matt Kane, and I suspect - given how good this film is - you'll be hearing more about him in the future."
m/august_osage_county, Wells deserves credit for juggling countless subplots without deflating the vitality of the material. The movie's so busy with squabbling that it's best appreciated as a collage of flawed intentions rather than their collective outcome
m/august_rush," Overly sentimental it may be, but August Rush took me quite willingly to a cinematic world full of music and hope."
m/augustine_2012," Alice Winocour's take on this true story carries the superficial trappings of a period drama, but its perspective is entirely contemporary."
m/aurora_2011," Aurora fully explores the time before and after a killer strikes, and it has the cumulative effect of making what passes for a ""motive"" seem absurdly simplistic."
m/austenland_2013," Keri Russell is likable, but this feels like too conventional a rom-com for Sundance."
m/austin_powers_in_goldmember," Just when I thought that the series had run out of originality, Mike Myers has to prove me wrong."
m/austin_powers_international_man_of_mystery," While that brand of humor is simplistic, Myers manages to make much of it surprisingly funny."
m/austin_powers_the_spy_who_shagged_me," When a satirical comedy loses its sense of discovery, there's not much reason for it to exist."
m/australia," The film looks magnificent but is far too long. The star power is dazzling but I didn't believe the central characters or their relationship. Nonetheless, it's an engrossing experience and one whose indelible images of a strikingly beautiful land linger."
m/australias_lost_gold," A splendid example of the sort of subjective documentary film-making championed by Werner Herzog...director Luke Walker throws himself into the legend of Harold Lasseter, the explorer who claimed to have stumbled across a mother lode of gold."
m/author_the_jt_leroy_story," [Laura Albert] is a compelling storyteller, granting a tongue-in-cheek quality to support the documentary's rollercoaster journey concerning very real emotional traumas."
m/authors_anonymous," ""Authors Anonymous"" proves too kindhearted to stick to its satirical guns; even the documentary conceit recedes when it becomes inconvenient."
m/auto_focus," It would be a mistake to write this movie off as yet another Star Is Born-type biopic about the rise and fall of a latter%u2011day celebrity. Schrader is after something deeper here and even when he misses the mark, the film remains involving."
m/automata, The poetry in Ibez's soul has to cohabit with a lot of spray cheese.
m/autumn_in_new_york," While Autumn in New York is a dreadful film, it's not substantially worse than a lot of the what spills out of Tinseltown during the hot season."
m/autumn_lights," It's a museum piece with respectable craftsmanship but little life, reserved only for viewers with a particular Euro-style cinema fetish and access to a very comfortable seat."
m/autumn_sonata," With its raw performances and lyrical dialogue this is a sombre, resonant, lingering drama about family dysfunction and emotional frustration."
m/autumn_spring, Mr. Brodsky's final screen performance in one of his richest roles finds overlapping layers of humor and pathos.
m/avanti," It's not vintage Billy Wilder, but even lesser Wilder has wit to spare."
m/avas_possessions, Ava's Possessions is a fantastic take on demon-centric storytelling and offers fans something a bit different and far more character-driven than we've seen in the horror genre as of late.
m/avatar, The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention.
m/avenged," ""Avenged"" unabashedly revels in vigilantism and poetic justice."
m/avengement, Avengement is... a streamlined monster giving Adkins a ferocious role to sink his teeth into and gnaw on until the bone is showing.
m/avengers_age_of_ultron," Fortunately, returning director Joss Whedon understands how to craft a superhero movie just as well as Marvel knows how to sell one."
m/avengers_endgame, Avengers Endgame is a beautiful and satisfying culmination of 22 films in the MCU. This film is not only monumental but a love letter to earth's mightiest heroes and its fans.
m/avengers_infinity_war, ...a business play forcing us to make yet another down payment on our collective Marvel mortgage.
m/aviator, A stirring depiction of a great man's tragic attempt to convince himself of future triumphs that would never materialize.
m/avp2," Direction consists of visuals that are dark and moody, but lack any genuine atmosphere. While the emphasis on old school prosthetics over CGI is welcome, it's all still one big technical exercise. The Brothers capture the look of Alien and Predator movies"
m/await_further_instructions," All at once tense family drama, Cronenbergian horror, social satire and sci-fi reimagining of the Nativity, Await Further Instructions shows how difficult it is to escape the domineering, malevolent influence of the media."
m/awake, For what it's worth: The best Jessica Alba movie of the year!
m/awake_2019, Awake (2019) releases its grip very early in the narrative.
m/awake_the_life_of_yogananda, A film that works both for followers and for those interested in knowing what yoga is truly about. Hint: It's not about six-pack abs.
m/away_from_her, Sarah Polley does well just to not let Her devolve into a Canadian version of The Notebook.
m/away_we_go," An uneven picture that's at times poignant and at times quite funny, but ultimately lacks a consistent flow."
m/awful_nice_2013," Even when bits go thud, there's a brittle, unsentimental wit about kin's inexplicable tug that's hard to ignore, and the leads - game for some surprisingly sublime bits of physical comedy - eventually wear one's anti-charm defenses down."
m/awful_truth, It is a surprisingly tight and densely-packed comedy with excellent performances all around.
m/awfully_big_adventure," As a portrait of the company and its emotional tangles, An Awfully Big Adventure has a gritty authenticity... But as drama and melodrama, the movie stumbles."
m/awol_2017," With simply stunning visuals and a powerhouse performance by Kirke, AWOL isn't likely to make any big screen impressions but will make its mark in the smaller market that it lands on."
m/axl," Meanwhile, the scientists who lost A-X-L spend half the movie watching these events unfold on a computer screen, doing not a danged thing because they want to see how it all pans out. They are, it must be said, lousy scientists."
m/axolotl_overkill," Chaotic lives can make for a muddled storyline, yet ultimately Hegemann allows her central character some kind of growth."
m/ayurveda_the_art_of_being," Pan Nalin's exposition is beautiful and mysterious, and the interviews that follow, with the practitioners of this ancient Indian practice, are as subtle and as enigmatic."
m/aziz_ansari_live_at_madison_square_garden," Even with B material he's an A performer on subjects like the failures of salad and vegetables, being single, and text messaging."
m/aziz_ansari_right_now, Right Now is not all good... But whatever soul-searching or image management that Ansari has gone through since the babe.net story has made him a better performer - one who is more able to dwell in gray areas of comedy.
m/baadasssss, BAADASSSSS! is a celebration of Melvin's struggle to make Baadassss Song on his own terms despite an endless string of financial and personal mishaps.
m/baader_meinhof_complex," An explosive performance by Johanna Wokalek gives some relief to an otherwise long and humdrum series of characters, blow-'em-ups and prison locations."
m/baaria---la-porta-del-vento," Although at times it feels a little too packed, taking a closer look into fascist times, war and the notorious Italian mafia through the eyes of every day people is refreshing."
m/babe_pig_in_the_city," Where Babe was warm, gentle, and cuddly, Pig in the City is fast paced and antic."
m/babel," This is not a fear-mongering movie, but it is unpredictable and shocking, with compassion hanging on for dear life."
m/babettes_feast," At turns philosophical and sensual, this hauntingly elegaic film resonates."
m/baby_boom," ''BABY BOOM'' isn't much more than a glorified sitcom, but it's funny, and it's liable to hit home."
m/baby_boy," When Snoop is the highlight of your film, you've got big problems."
m/baby_doll, an impressively steamy story for its day with some moments of true greatness
m/baby_driver," Plays out like blasting your coolest friend's record collection in your car at 100 mph on the Atlanta freeway while cops close in on all sides - essentially what happens in the movie again and again, to always-riveting effect."
m/baby_face, The peppy title tune over the opening credits hardly prepares you for the sordid story that follows...
m/baby_geniuses," By the time the tiresome, surprisingly violent climax began, the last nail had already been hammered in this unfortunate film's coffin."
m/baby_its_you, John Sayles takes on a genre movie and makes something that ends up as distinctive as his trademark ensemble films.
m/baby_mama," Drawing on Baby Boom and Odd Couple, this high-concept comedy lags behind the zeitgeist and may be more significant as corrective counterpoint to the male-driven fare of Apathow's factory in centering on charming femmes in the lead and supporting roles"
m/baby_secret_of_the_lost_legend," Baby turns out to be a real no-brainer. The movie even blows the one moment you'd assume couldn't fail -- the first sighting of a brontosaurus. Instead of a moment of quiet awe, the movie gives us the gee-whiz approach of a Godzilla remake."
m/baby_the_rain_must_fall," Foote's metaphors and psychological insights are so clearly delineated that there's little room for spontaneity, though the actors do what they can with the space they're given."
m/babylon," Babylon is rich, rough and real. And like the streetlife of the young black Londoners it portrays, it's threatening, touching, violent and funny."
m/babylon_ad," Kassovitz second American film is as disappointing as Gothica but for different reasons. The actioner, which opened in France, suffers from weak script, lack of unified vision and other problems of productions with international casts."
m/babys_day_out," Baby's Day Out contains gags that might have worked in a Baby Herman cartoon, but in live action, with real people, real taxis and buses and streets and a real baby, they're just not funny."
m/babysitters, Ultimately plays out as weakly as an actual adult film.
m/babysitters_club_the_movie," Though the script is predictable, it's not too clumsy."
m/babysplitters," This comedy about overplanned family planning might be a bit overplotted itself, but it makes for generally genial entertainment."
m/babyteeth, It keeps you on your toes from the moment it starts...
m/bachelorette," Caplan ... steals all of her scenes, takes them to the Target returns desk for illicit refunds, and spends all the money on whatever unicorn sweat gives you big, dewy eyes like Mary-Louise Parker."
m/bachna_ae_haseeno," Two and a half hours of this will try anyone's patience, so stave off the boredom by speculating about Kapoor and Padukone's off-screen romance; it looks like all that angsting paid off."
m/back-to-school," Dangerfield at his feature film best--and no, really, I do mean that as a good thing."
m/back_girl_1966," Decolonization in Black Girl is not only a myth, but also a myth that actually strengthens the consumerist caste systems."
m/back_in_the_day, ...the movie remains surprisingly watchable virtually from beginning to end.
m/back_roads_2018," A dark, claustrophobic thriller that stays on your mind long after viewing."
m/back_to_burgundy," Cédric Klapisch's drama, co-written by a vintner, is an authentic love letter to the wine business, but as drama it lacks the subtlety of a vintage."
m/back_to_the_future, Crispin Glover and Christopher Lloyd are both standouts.
m/back_to_the_future_2, 'De Volta Para o Futuro 2'  uma continuao  altura do original e merece ser visto - antes que o velho Biff altere tudo novamente.
m/back_to_the_future_3, Mildly entertaining conclusion to the iconic 1980s trilogy. Everyone is to be commended for quitting while they were ahead.
m/back_up_plan, Just another boneheaded replay of the dumbest sitcom pregnancy and parenting cliches. They scrape the bottom of the barrel and then they dig a little deeper.
m/backcountry," Concocted with ace precision, worthy of a spectacle of well-earned winces and gasps."
m/backdraft_2," Unnecessary, nonsensical sequel has violence, language."
m/backstabbing_for_beginners," Intriguing but bland, muddled and compromised dirty-dealing-at-the-U.N. thriller that hangs on a dull performance by Theo James."
m/backtrace, The biggest problem with this absurdly incoherent crime thriller is that it's played with a straight face.
m/backtrack_2016, [Backtrack is] saddled with an overworked air of mystery that turns into vagueness and a little too much of a sullen atmosphere for its own good.
m/backwards, Hickernell soft-pedals the material into a blandly feel-good dramedy.
m/bad_and_the_beautiful," This is studio-system product at its juiciest and most sophisticated, full of insights into the mess behind the art."
m/bad_ass_2012," Bad Ass won't be confused with 'Death Wish' or even 'Gran Torino,' but it's superior to Trejo's recent dud 'Machete'"
m/bad_blood_the_movie, It's a strange little thing out of left field that brings a richness and humor to what easily could have been a simple creature flick.
m/bad_boy_bubby, The success of the film is largely due to the bravura performance by Hope.
m/bad_boys_1982, strong performances led by Sean Penn in a role that solidified his status as the best young actor of the 1980s
m/bad_boys_for_life," Bantering back and forth, Lawrence and Smith manage to recreate some of their screen chemistry-though not enough to make anyone want to go on another bumpy ride."
m/bad_boys_ii, It's like an overtickled funny bone that becomes numb because you can't think of something more clever to do.
m/bad_company_2002," ""Welcome to my church, where we worship money,"" says the film's Czech ghoul. Words fit for Bruckheimer."
m/bad_day_at_black_rock, There is absolutely nothing in [John Sturges'] background that would suggest he would make such a contrarian film.
m/bad_day_for_the_cut," Manages to develop its own distinct flavor while fitting snugly into the general tradition of latter-day U.K. gangster pics, with their rueful humor, colorful characters and realistically nasty violence."
m/bad_education," Vivid, colourful filmmaking with frequent touches of outrageous flamboyance, nearly overwhelming sexual tension and astutely political parallels."
m/bad_education_2019," It's a story about the lengths people will go to for self-preservation, deliciously mean and as funny as it is outrageous."
m/bad_hurt," An explosive family drama whose intense performances can't always compensate for such a heavy-handed scenario, Bad Hurt nonetheless marks a promising directorial debut from playwright Mark Kemble."
m/bad_influence," Lowe and Spader deliver some great work in this fairly familiar, yet still enjoyable, thriller."
m/bad_johnson," Huck Botko's film asks us to laugh at, even revel in, the misadventures of womanizing men, even as it condemns them for their behavior."
m/bad_kids_go_to_hell," This mixture of thriller, horror and satire flaunts a smart-ass tone that proves deadening. As the body count starts rising, viewer interest quickly begins dropping."
m/bad_lieutenant," When I think back on watching this film, two thoughts immediately cross my mind. First, it was a terribly unpleasant experience, and secondly, it was a brilliant."
m/bad_lieutenant_port_of_call_new_orleans, ...a surprisingly compelling piece of work that'll undoubtedly (and deservedly) earn itself a cult following in the years to come...
m/bad_milo," Bad Milo! gets nasty laughs out of putting its overmatched hero through a gauntlet of comic humiliations, but it works just as well as a dark allegory about the way we handle our demons."
m/bad_moms," I found it funny and entertaining as it unfolded, but have a feeling a second viewing might elicit a less favorable response. (Full Content Review for Parents - Nudity, Sexual Content, Profanity, etc. - Available)"
m/bad_moon," The werewolf costume, animatronic facial movements, and makeup effects are superb."
m/bad_news_bears, Glenn Ficarra & John Requa's respectfully faithful script and Linklater's typically unforced directing style combine to generate many moments of laugh-out-loud comedy.
m/bad_rap, Newcomer Salima Koroma takes a good look at a handful of Asian-American talents trying to break into the hip-hop scene.
m/bad_reputation_2018, Guitar rock's original lady badass reminds us how she became an icon.
m/bad_samaritan," Bad Samaritan could have been a gem, if only it had put as much effort into its story as its setup."
m/bad_santa," Extremely funny -- at times sidesplittingly so -- thanks to Zwigoff's way with raw irreverence and Thornton's perfectly pitched, ready-for- anything performance."
m/bad_santa_2," Bad Santa 2 devolves into a series of one-liners trying way too hard to be offensive. Bad Santa may have had some memorable lines, but it wasn't a jokey movie."
m/bad_taste," The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson's debut is rather aptly named. Its crudity has more to do with Sam Raimi than Tolkein, but there's a wonderfully sophomoric enthusiasm that keeps it interesting."
m/bad_teacher," Bad Teacher could have dared to push the 15-rating further, and it probably would have been funnier as a result, but on the back of a refreshingly irreverent turn from Cameron Diaz, the flaws are easy to forgive."
m/bad_therapy," ""Bad Therapy"" is the cinematic equivalent of lukewarm water."
m/bad_times_at_the_el_royale," Bad Times at the El Royale is a deliciously entertaining, if sometimes slow, love letter to film noir from director Drew Goddard elevated by the cast."
m/bad_turn_worse," Gorgeously photographed, the Hawkins' film has a functionality to their work that doesn't add too many unnecessary flourishes, but it exudes a grace that elevates what might have been purely cliched material to something more special."
m/bad_words," Bad Words wants so desperately to be funny, there isn't much time left to make any logic out of the story."
m/badlands," Bonnie and Clyde without the Freud, but with a darker, more incomprehensible underbelly."
m/bag_it, Humble documentary makes a non-biodegradable impression
m/bagdad_cafe, An exotic celebration of the beauty of human personality and friendship.
m/baggage_claim, Enough to make Black Jesus weep in despair at the failure of filmmaking fundamentals.
m/baghead," A blast of fresh air. It has warmth and innovation, and the mischievous good sense to subtly make fun of the type of film that it is."
m/bai_ri_yan_huo," Moments of shocking violence, a passive/aggressive femme fatale and hints of psychological depth don't do much to goose the TV cop show plot."
m/bai_she_chuan_shuo_2013," A masterpiece of imagination. Offers wall-to-wall goofy fun for fans of martial arts flicks, fantasies, or just good old-fashioned cinematic nuttiness."
m/bait_3d," A nice balance between tension, comic relief and the rising body count"
m/bakery_in_brooklyn, A film that aspires to evoke classics of American comedy like the works of Capra or Lubitsch. [Full review in Spanish]
m/balada_triste_de_trompeta," Leave any semblance of sensitivity at the box office and enjoy this breathlessly paced, visually busy, certifiably nutty slice of Spanish surrealism."
m/ball_of_fire," A great screwball comedy, with Stanwyck in one of her sexiest roles."
m/ballad_of_bering_strait, There's an infectious hope that permeates Ballad's short breath.
m/ballad_of_cable_hogue, A funky and appealing Western parable directed by Sam Peckinpah.
m/ballad_of_jack_and_rose," As an investigation of disturbing behavior, the film is near perfect. As a dramatic creation, Miller's inventive filmmaking skills have failed her."
m/ballad_of_little_jo, The film ends as more of a dirge than a ballad. But occasionally it casts a forlorn spell. The meaning of Jo Monaghan's life may not really emerge in this film but its mystery lingers.
m/ballet_422," 'Ballet 422' charts the production of a ballet from the mind of the choreographer to the premiere, drawing its beauty from the little details of rehearsal and preparation over the obvious glories of opening night."
m/ballistic_ecks_vs_sever," It hopes to obscure its awfulness with its volume and, failing that, it hopes to dress up its stupidity with backlit shots of a woman communing with a captive manatee."
m/ballplayer_pelotero, An unexpectedly gripping portrait of how MLB's sausage gets made ...
m/balls_of_fury," A juvenile comedy aiming for dumb, obvious humor, Balls of Fury fails horribly as lame spoof of sports films and martial-arts flicks, drifting along with low energy and uninspired shtick."
m/balthazar," This great film, made with uncompromising honesty and devastating reality, is, according to Jean-Luc Godard, 'the world in an hour and a half.'"
m/balto," The new animated picture from Stephen Spielberg's production company, takes a genuinely appealing, inspirational story and reduces it to, at best, a passable entertainment that might please younger children."
m/balzac_and_the_little_chinese_seamstress," Adapting his own autobiographical novel, director Dai Sijie's intimacy with his subject allows for a remarkably assured mise-en-scene."
m/bambi, Beautiful in every sense of the word. I consider it the finest Disney Classic out there.
m/bambi_ii, ...Bambi II never quite comes off as anything more than a needless sequel.
m/banana_split_2020," Kasulke maintains a strong rapport with his cast and as a result the performances rarely feel forced, even when things get a bit outrageous, although for a cinematographer-turned-director, he favors a fairly subdued visual style."
m/bananas," Bananas is chockfull of sight gags, one-liners and swiftly executed unnecessary excursions into vulgarity whose humor for the most part can't make up for content."
m/band_aid_2017," Writer-director Zoe Lister-Jones brilliantly cuts through to the heart of a truly loving couple with legitimate problems, and their endearing way of reconnecting."
m/band_of_angels," ...an outdated, relentlessly irrelevant piece of work."
m/band_of_robbers_2016," The end result may read as a gussied-up Funny or Die conceit at times, but through a surprising dramatic focus and well-written script it still performs wonderfully as an absurdist crime comedy with a wicked streak."
m/band_wagon," It has its moments and the stars are good, but it's really overrated."
m/bandb_2018," B&B is less action-oriented and more talky than traditional thrillers, but its topical subject matter and good performances make it one to seek out"
m/bandidas, This is a 'summer movie' if I ever saw one. Release it already!
m/bandits," Bandits may be somewhat offbeat, but that hardly makes it worthwhile."
m/bandolero_1968," Buoyed by a strong cast and carried by an interesting mix of genre sensibilities, it's a film that may not have much lasting value but is fun nonetheless."
m/bandslam, Todd Graff's film is written with a desperate cleverness that clamors for attention over the brainless against-the-odds music-competition plot.
m/bang_bang_club," Ryan Phillippe, Taylor Kitsch and South Africans Neels Van Jaarsveld and Frank Rautenbach play the heroic foursome (two of whom won Pulitzers for their riveting photos) whose images shocked the world awake."
m/banger_sisters," Bypasses cheap laughs, thankfully, in favor of surprisingly touching ones."
m/bangkok_dangerous," Heavy on the spice and cheap on the meat, Bangkok Dangerous adds plenty of Thai seasoning to the Hollywood lone-assassin recipe, but the result is only mildly pungent."
m/bangkok_dangerous_1999, A fistful of baht that you shouldn't let slip through your fingers.
m/banksy_does_new_york," A documentary with all the noise, mayhem, pandemonium and ingenuity of both the artist and the city that never sleeps, although it still manages to dream."
m/baps, I do have some free advise for both Landau and Berry: Fire your agents.
m/baraka," Any one sequence might work powerfully in its own right, but string them together with a musical overlay and the banality of the connections becomes apparent."
m/baran, It shows us a slice of life that's very different from our own and yet instantly recognizable.
m/barb_wire," Made with a wafer-thin stylishness that thinks dressing the Congressionals like storm troopers is creative, Barb Wire plods along, following one pro forma scene with the next."
m/barbara_2012," Not only has director Christian Petzold assembled a fascinating hill of beans, but there's a moonlit scene that almost alone justifies his Silver Bear win at Berlin."
m/barbara_rubin_and_the_exploding_ny_underground," It may be much too short, but pound for pound, minute for minute, there are few biographical documentaries more impressive than this."
m/barbarella, A nutty film that boasts at times beautiful photography of some cheap but truly epic sets of PVC and everything that clings.
m/barbarian_invasions," The dramatic tangle of family in The Barbarian Invasions is reduced to a bizarre cartoon of name-dropping, smug banter, and straggling sex-rev nostalgia."
m/barbershop," Although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play, the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs."
m/barbershop_2_back_in_business," Sullivan clearly has his own ideas, but wisely uses the established characters to flesh them out instead of making them act out of character for his purposes."
m/barbershop_the_next_cut_2016," For all its faults, there is something wise and enjoyable in the way the members of the shop and community talk about the problems in Barbershop: The Next Cut."
m/barbie-in-the-nutcracker, It looks rough... [but] I think that in this case there are enough other things working that I can handle it.
m/barefoot_2014, This ill-advised romance from director Andrew Fleming is the sort of indie lark that nearly drowns in its own whimsy. Wade in at your own risk.
m/barefoot_in_the_park," Nothing special, but it's a decent example of a vanished genre - the small character comedy."
m/barfi, Quirky deaf man gets entangled in love triangle in poignant Bollywood romantic comedy.
m/barfly, A terrific little film that features the best performance Mickey Rourke has ever given. It drags you into its world and makes you care about the characters.
m/barking_dogs_never_bite_2000," It may not be quite as sharp as some of the later works of Bong Joon-ho, but this Barking Dog certainly has plenty of bite."
m/barkleys_of_broadway," It's Fred and Ginger and in color, but the movie's pretty bad."
m/barneys-version," A decently made, mildly enjoyable, but not great version of Richler's famous novel, which suffers from being too literal and literary."
m/barneys_great_adventure," Really, even three-year-olds deserve better than this."
m/barnyard, The barnyard is the Middle East; the hens represent the oil wealth; and the humans are the ineffectual United Nations! Or... perhaps it's all just a mediocre cartoon about talking barnyard animals. Whichever.
m/barretts_of_wimpole_street," Sidney Franklin has filmed a drama of beauty, dignity and nobility."
m/barry_2016," Set in 1981, a canny and absorbing drama paints a highly convincing portrait of Barack Obama when he was a 20-year-old college student in New York, still piecing together who he was."
m/barry_lyndon," The loveliest of Stanley Kubrick films. Indeed, Barry Lyndon is the one Kubrick movie that could even invite that adjective (or epithet)."
m/barrymore, A wistful look at faded dreams and opportunities lost due to both the vagaries of the business and self-sabotage.
m/bart_got_a_room," It's sort of ironic that the only demographic that'll appreciate this lame, watered-down brand of humor mirrors the community portrayed in the film: the elderly and infirm"
m/bartleby_2002," It's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years, and Chaykin and Headly are priceless."
m/barton_fink, Interesting Coen Bros. venture. Goodman was most strange.
m/baseketball," [A] funny, gleefully offensive spoof of professional sports."
m/basic," John Travolta and Connie Nielsen play the film's truth seekers, and each is interesting enough to carry an audience through an overly mechanical screenplay with little on its mind other than deceiving viewers."
m/basic_instinct," The snappy dialogue and high-calibre acting, by the central characters and a strong supporting cast ... keeps the film from tipping over the brink into Showgirls territory."
m/basic_instinct_2," The 14-year-behind-the-scenes story of making this sequel is far more interesting than anything that's onscreen, including Sharon Stone's nudity and sex in a rooftop jacuzzi."
m/basket," Clearly well-intentioned but wildly overplotted and, curiously enough, emotionally underdeveloped."
m/basket_case," The DIY effects may look naively amateur today but there's a loving B-movie attitude and a genuine sense of character to the ""monster,"" the misshapen, fleshy, snaggle-toothed Belial."
m/baskin," surreal, uncompromising, bestial and eerily beautiful... even if it is not, despite what some unsuspecting viewers may believe, named for a certain popular brand of ice cream, Evrenol's film sure is one haunting Turkish delight."
m/basmati_blues, There's nothing wrong about sending the message of fighting corporate greed but it's through execution of the material that ultimately fails Basmati Blues.
m/basquiat," Schnabel made his film about Basquiat, which carries its own validation. He's also made something of a work of art in its own right."
m/bat_21, Enjoyable Vietnam War actioner with a good dynamic between Hackman and Glover.
m/bat_whispers, The Bat Whispers is a talkie remake of Roland West's silent 1926 version.
m/bathtubs_over_broadway," By presenting the gleeful idiosyncrasy of these artists' flamboyantly poetic renderings of arch-prosaic subjects, Young and Whisenant confront colossal matters of aesthetic theory with a sly wink."
m/batkid_begins," ""Batkid Begins"" doesn't have answers for our many troubles, nor will it change the world, but it provides hope for humanity, and that's something we surely need to see more of right now."
m/batman_and_harley_quinn," Make no mistake, this is a gorgeously rendered tribute to Batman: The Animated Series and the voice cast was top notch. But Batman and Harley Quinn just doesn't stand up to the best episodes of that show."
m/batman_and_mr_freeze_subzero, One of the less-inspired animated Batman efforts [but] an enjoyable and generally kid-friendly adventure all the same.
m/batman_assault_on_arkham," While Batman: Assault on Arkham takes the opportunity to cast Batman villains in lead roles, it doesn't come close to exploring all the potential those characters offer."
m/batman_bad_blood, Manages to make you realise why you love Batman and his world so much yet without even really featuring the main course himself.
m/batman_begins, And now a simple appraisal for the fanboys: Darkity-darkity dark-dark-dark! Happy now? You should be!
m/batman_beyond_return_of_the_joker," If the premise of Batman Beyond was originally a gimmick, it has become one that is equally innovative and carefully crafted."
m/batman_forever, You can tell that a series is transforming to a product when the original creative people start having less and less to do with the new chapters.
m/batman_gotham_knight," As diferentes abordagens estticas enriquecem o projeto, que realmente merece aplausos com relao ao seu design de produo. Infelizmente, os roteiros dos episdios so medianos em sua maioria, comprometendo o resultado final."
m/batman_hush," Batman gets hot and heavy with Catwoman in an action-packed, intriguing mystery. Batman: Hush is a stellar entry in the DC Animated Universe."
m/batman_mask_of_the_phantasm," Fans of classical animation are hereby warned to steer clear of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, for it will put them in instant vapor-lock and there aren't enough ambulances available this time of year."
m/batman_ninja, As bonkers a Bat-tale as you will find... a stylish and fresh take that can get away with all of its quirks and eccentricities.
m/batman_return_of_the_caped_crusaders, A perfect piece worthy of collection that feels like a trip to the past but refreshing at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]
m/batman_returns," Michelle is just amazing. Every move is unpredictable, every line is said perfectly and she makes her character so seductive, she could make Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy look like Mr. Freeze."
m/batman_the_dark_knight_returns_part_1_2012," If you're a Batman fan, just hearing the words The Dark Knight Returns likely gets you excited, so this film was probably already on your radar..."
m/batman_the_killing_joke, Batman: The Killing Joke is borderline unsettling - and not in a good way.
m/batman_the_movie, Dreadful unwatchable movie version of the campy Batman television series popular in the 1960s.
m/batman_under_the_red_hood," Definitely not for young kids, but it's smart pulp writing and well put together for a direct-to-DVD animation."
m/batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice, Watching Batman and Superman rage at each other like little boys makes for a pretty tedious two and a half hours.
m/batman_vs_robin, [T]he climactic battle has some especially impressive close-up scenes of Batman in hand-to-hand combat that are among the best yet in these DC animated releases.
m/batman_vs_two_face," Sentimentality aside with the final film performance of Adam West, Batman vs. Two Face captures the magic and spirit of the fondly remembered TV series."
m/batman_year_one," Batman: Year One adapts Frank Miller's tale with excellent animation and first-rate voice work from a talented cast, finding a nice balance between human moments and exciting action sequences."
m/bats, Bats has the look and feel of a film which really belongs in the straight to video category but it has just enough cheap thrills for genre buffs to give it a look.
m/batteries_not_included," The extraterrestrial elves, who thrive on electricity and replicate themselves out of scrap metal, are no less charming, and the special effects show them off gracefully."
m/battle-los-angeles," At a time when Hollywood is generally too afraid to touch America's dual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Battle: Los Angeles offers up a safer alternative"
m/battle_beyond_the_stars," Ah, that lovable B-movie sci-fi crap from the early eighties."
m/battle_for_brooklyn," Although Battle for Brooklyn gives voice to the project's supporters, there's little doubt which side Galinsky and Hawley are on."
m/battle_for_haditha," ...the film retains many of the cinema verite qualities of Broomfield's previous works, lending it a powerful, devastating immediacy."
m/battle_for_terra_2009," Too thematically dim to hold the interest of adults, and too alienating and violent to appeal to children, ""Battle for Terra"" is an off-putting animated sci-fi flick for no one."
m/battle_for_the_planet_of_the_apes," With the budgets decreasing, creative ideas waning, and costumes and makeup getting more worn-out, it's a good thing that this is the final sequel."
m/battle_in_seattle, An uneven but ultimately impassioned recreation of the riots at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle.
m/battle_of_britain, An all-star ensemble cast consisting of the who's who of British films can't save the war epic from being a bore.
m/battle_of_shaker_heights," The Battle of Shaker Heights is the best movie ever to come out of a reality TV series. I haven't seen From Justin to Kelly, The Real Cancun or Stolen Summer, but I can assume. The film's novelty is the war re-enactment motif."
m/battle_of_the_sexes, Battle of the Sexes is an entertaining and inspiring story about a dogged woman winning against men who don't take her seriously enough.
m/battle_of_the_year," At the risk of sounding 100, I think it's regrettable this film had to be shot in digital 3-D."
m/battle_royale," Fukasaku's film maybe can't maintain the sheer exhilarating rush of its first thirty minutes, but it's an outstanding work nevertheless."
m/battlefield_america, Even the most forgiving viewers may feel like they've been underestimated - and underserved.
m/battlefield_earth, Battlefield Earth has the feel of a movie made by a precocious 8-year-old with access to too many leftover costumes from Clan of the Cave Bear and Star Trek: The Next Generation.
m/battleship," With an onslaught of jaw-dropping visual effects, non-stop action and a narrative that delivers some surprises, Battleship booms onto the screen with style and scale"
m/battleship_potemkin," comes from a time where films communicated primarily through images, even if its themes fade into historical irrelevance."
m/battlestar_galactica, The movie evinces a complete lack of imagination. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/battling_butler, There's no room for Buster to stretch out; none of the rhythms are remotely like his own.
m/baywatch_2017," It's eerily similar to the TV show, but not strictly in content or execution... No, what the film-makers have captured and emulated is the TV show's trademark combination of conspicuous sleaze and formal naivety."
m/bb_king_the_life_of_riley_2012," In the music business, 'legend' is an over-used word: see this and understand what it means."
m/be_afraid_2017, ... terror is diluted in the drama. [Full review in Spanish]
m/be_cool," It should be a rule of filmmaking that when the plot fizzles out, the film should end"
m/be_here_to_love_me_a_film_about_townes_van_zandt," A less-than-satisfying examination of the country singer's art, career and demons."
m/be_kind_rewind," For all of Gondry's undeniable talent, it would be hard to imagine him pulling off this delicate and even cornball conceit without his star, Jack Black."
m/be_my_cat_a_film_for_anne, It's precisely because it feels so real that it feels so stomach-droppingly plausible: The mundanity makes it all the more terrifying.
m/be_natural_the_untold_story_of_alice_guy_blache," When we talk about cinema, we talk about the history of cinema. It's an incomplete history; it always has been and always will be. But, thanks to Be Natural, we can start to see what the whole picture looks like. What a beautiful picture it is."
m/be_with_me, Be With Me puts it all out there with tremendous yet understated power.
m/beach," It's Beach Blanket Bingo revisited, but with a Eurocast and more exotic locations."
m/beach_party," Silly '60s surf musical with stereotypes, sexual situations."
m/beach_rats_2017," This is achingly delicate psychological territory, heavily dependent on just the right actor to make flesh its scripted subtleties - and Hittman has found him in Dickinson ..."
m/beaches," Even though tear-jerking has never been so blatant, your tears of laughter are replaced, dammit, by tears of grief."
m/bean," Not only do we not care about Bean, we want him to just go away and not bother us anymore."
m/beanpole, A solid and absorbing film. [Full review in Spanish]
m/bearcity," With its voyeuristic gawking of faintly explicit sexual acts in a dark club setting, BearCity has more in common with William Friedkin's Cruising (made in 1980) than an upbeat modern film should."
m/beast_from_20000_fathoms," Despite more than a suspicion of palaver, it generates a fair portion of interest and climactic excitement ..."
m/beast_of_burden_2018," Every design element is working in sync to never let us feel comfortable, creating a remarkably cramped ambiance."
m/beast_within," Because Mora doesn't go the usual route for The Beast Within, the film ends up being a bit of an oddball creature feature that often stumbles a bit tonally and suffers from some pacing issues around the midway point."
m/beastly," In an era of bullies and mean girls, ""Gossip Girls"" and ""Pretty Little Liars,"" it's nice to have such a tenderhearted fairy tale."
m/beasts_of_the_southern_wild, A stunning debut that finds its dandelion-haired heroine fighting rising tides and fantastic creatures in a mythic battle against modernity.
m/beat_street, Interesting way of looking at a long-dead culture first coming to life.
m/beat_that_my_heart_skipped," Audiard has, through a few plot changes and even more differences in tone and performance, surprisingly made a silk purse out of Toback's sow's ear."
m/beatles_a_hard_days_night," There will always be Beatles revivals, but we're way overdue for a major Richard Lester revival."
m/beatles_the_help," charming but slight, a step back from Hard Day's Night"
m/beatles_the_yellow_submarine," This psychedelic trip into the minds of the Beatles is certainly memorable, but you have to wonder what this movie would be like without the awesome collection of Beatles tunes punctuating the soundtrack."
m/beats_rhymes_and_life_the_travels_of_a_tribe_called_quest," A welcome blast of '90s nostalgia, taking us back to a time - and a sound - that pulsates with optimism."
m/beau_geste," Well directed by William Wellman, this second version of the popular novel is a fun adventure, perhpas a notch below the silent starrting Ronald Colman."
m/beautician_and_the_beast, Beauty and the Beast combined with Fran- what more could you ask for?
m/beautiful-darling," Perhaps it's time we acknowledged that, despite their outr appetites, Warhol's superstars may have been legitimately boring people."
m/beautiful_boxer," Ekachai Uekrongtham imbues Toom's story with great tenderness, lush visuals and fierce physicality."
m/beautiful_boy, Filmmaker Shawn Ku achieves an impressive balance of formal control and emotional spontaneity in debut feature Beautiful Boy.
m/beautiful_country," Moland's humanistic story about xenophobia, man's persevering spirit, and life's bitter ironies only stumbles during its final act."
m/beautiful_creatures, Sadly little more than a (very) poor man's Thelma And Louise.
m/beautiful_creatures_2013," [VIDEO ESSAY] An imaginative adolescent gothic romance, ""Beautiful Creatures"" arrives with considerably more camp and intellectual humor than the ""Twilight"" franchise to which ""Creatures"" is sure to be compared."
m/beautiful_girls," It doesn't always take you where you'd like it to go, but that's all right."
m/beautiful_kate, Bouquets to Rachel Ward whose adept and sensitive screenplay and direction make this adaptation an emotional journey that resonates acutely.
m/beautiful_losers," Like the art scene it documents, Beautiful Losers is chaotic, anarchic, rambling and populated by charismatic freaks with statement T-shirts, complicated haircuts and impossibly rare trainers."
m/beautiful_mind, [Crowe's performance is] still one of the better roles you'll see all year and seems a shoo-in for a Hanks-like third nomination in a row.
m/beautiful_people," I have made the film sound grim. Actually it is fairly lighthearted, under the circumstances; like Catch-22, it enjoys the paradoxes that occur when you try to apply logic to war."
m/beautiful_something," Bits and pieces of the gay-themed drama ""Beautiful Something"" feel real and essential. But this slow-going film often suffers from a forced, navel-gazing quality that can prove exasperating."
m/beautiful_thing, Manages to do what few films have done -- convey coming out with the specificity that draws viewers in while conveying a universality that hits home.
m/beautiful_truth, Boring like a one-note school lecture but nevertheless is credible as it makes its case about the need for alternative medicines.
m/beautifully_broken," A faith-based drama that flatly and clumsily marries an American story to two African ones, and loses its heart every time it leaves Rwanda for Nashville."
m/beauty-and-the-beast-the-enchanted-christmas, A typically low-rent direct-to-video Disney sequel...
m/beauty_and_the_beast_1991," Splendidly crafted as it is, the new Disney is a luscious impasto of visual invention that never quite finds its heart."
m/beauty_and_the_beast_2014," While Christophe Gans is a visual master, his vision of Beauty and the Beast is more thorn than rose."
m/beauty_and_the_beast_2017," There's no need to worry that this version might crush the gentle charms of the 1991 picture: Even though Condon more or less faithfully follows that movie's plot, this Beauty is its own resplendent creature."
m/beauty_is_embarrassing," White's philosophy of life seems to be ""Just do it,"" and that's what he's been doing more or less his whole life."
m/beavis_and_butt_head_do_america, It's like the TV series with all the sucky bits removed.
m/because_i_said_so," Keaton gives a manic, slapstick performance that alternates between being merely bad and being embarrassingly bad. Her work has an unbearable finger-across-the-blackboard effect."
m/because_of_winndixie," Uneven though it is, Because of Winn-Dixie, based on Kate Di Camillo's novel, is tough to dislike."
m/becket," Most of the dialogue-driven scenes are a series of two-shots; which is great in seeing the sparks fly between two of the leading British actors of their generation, but plodding when it comes to pace."
m/becks," With Becks, directors Elizabeth Rohrbaugh and Daniel Powell have crafted an understated musical that really works, thanks to Alyssa Robbins's heartfelt music and standout performances from the cast."
m/becky_2020," Becky is bad, just not in a way that's any fun, and James neither embarrasses himself nor has an Uncut Gems moment like his pal Adam Sandler."
m/becoming_2020_2," Becoming is very much a work in progress and hence, good TV across the spectrum."
m/becoming_astrid," Under Pernille Fischer Christensen's astute direction, the actors never descend into bathos."
m/becoming_jane," While there is little that is fresh in this costume drama, it is well done and Anne Hathaway makes a delightful Jane, who is unafraid to defy convention."
m/becoming_traviata," It works as a reminder of the important interactiveness of the performing arts, of actors evoking the drama, action, and emotion that computers and machines cannot."
m/bedazzled_1967bedazzled_2000, As close as narrative film would ever come to reproducing the Cook and Moore of such stage shows as Beyond the Fringe and Good Evening.
m/bedford_incident," Poitier does an excellent job in both the light and serious aspects of his role, and manages to leave a personal stamp on his scenes."
m/bedknobs_and_broomsticks," If Jessica Fletcher was a witch all along, you think she could've kept Cabot Cove a little safer"
m/bedlam," While the film has a tendency to wander into unadulterated Hollywoodisms in spots, it is a generally straight-forward and imaginative estimate of a two-century-old sociological theme."
m/bedroom_window," Surprisingly solid homage to Hitchcock, film noir, and moody old mysteries. Too bad about the Guttenberg, though."
m/bedtime_for_bonzo, The film is always enjoyable in spite of its shortcomings.
m/bedtime_stories," There may once have been a charming idea at the heart of Bedtime Stories, but alas, whatever it might have been has been Sandler-ized. And not for your protection."
m/bee_movie," Certainly Bee Movie could've been smarter, faster, and far cleverer, and it's disappointing to watch Seinfeld settle for less. For a man who made a mint reveling in comedic risk on a weekly basis, his first movie lacks serious sting."
m/bee_season," May have blown me away if its driving force wasn't rooted in the secrets of Kabbalah, which instead made me feel like I was being brainwashed with a cult recruitment film"
m/been_rich_all_my_life, A treasure that celebrates remarkable women with a unparalleled zest for life.
m/been_so_long," Crucially, underneath the music and the soft-focus romance Been So Long makes some poignant observations about community, family and the importance of connection."
m/beer_for_my_horses," Michael Salomon traffics in easy plot points like kidnapped damsels and land-grubbing farm barons (Barry Corbin), paired with casual sexism, copious booze and uncomfortable bigotry."
m/beer_league, Does the movie hit a home run? Hardly. But it's at least a single.
m/beer_wars," Even if ""Beer Wars"" works best as a brief introduction to craft beers, and inspires audiences to explore craft breweries in their area and beyond, then the film works."
m/beerfest," This ode to the mass consumption of tasty brews is out of bubbles. Drink up before you see it, you'll need the buzz."
m/beeswax," Andrew Bujalski's third film is another memorably natural character piece evoking the spirit of Rohmer, Cassavetes and Woody Allen in a uniquely young American style."
m/beethovens_3rd, Pointless sequel filled with predictable comedic pratfalls.
m/beetle_queen_conquers_tokyo, A disappointingly tedious slog through a seemingly fascinating subject.
m/beetlejuice," [The] actors, not surprisingly, are limited by the stupidity of their material."
m/before_i_disappear_2014," There's no doubting the craftsmanship behind it, even as the movie struggles to assemble the echoes of its earlier iteration into a greater whole."
m/before_i_fall," The film mostly retains its humanity, largely thanks to Deutch's performance and Russo-Young's insistence on keeping her at the forefront of almost every shot."
m/before_i_go_to_sleep," A handsome thriller, absorbing for its duration and with a couple of neat rug-pulls."
m/before_midnight_2013, One of the great movie romances of the modern era achieves its richest and fullest expression in Before Midnight.
m/before_night_falls, Convincingly shows how freedom is the air that writers must breathe in order to fully express their creative souls.
m/before_stonewall, Join[s] Paris Is Burning (1990) and How to Survive a Plague (2012) in the top tier of documentaries concerning LGBTQ+ history and culture.
m/before_sunrise, ...a bittersweet celebration of romantic frisson - the notion that our most precious moments of connection are often the fleeting ones.
m/before_sunset," This movie is basically a yakfest, but an incredibly fluid and involving one . . ."
m/before_the_devil_knows_youre_dead, A crime drama on par with classics like the Coens' Fargo with intense drama in the vein of Todd Field's In the Bedroom.
m/before_the_flood_2016, A compelling argument for necessary action to combat climate change.
m/before_we_go," If there is anything Chris Evans can take away from ""Before We Go,"" it would be to treat the film as a tremendous learning experience. Making a good film requires more than simply aping the structure and superficial qualities of better movies."
m/before_you_know_it_2013, At times it just seems like people you know hamming it up for the camera.
m/begin_again_2013," ...director John Carney is traveling over the same ground as he did with Once, though the results are far less potent...Can A Song Save Your Life? is a rhetorical question in the grand scheme of a film that offers little stakes."
m/beginners," It's strongest as the story of an artist who, in his own way, has only begun to come out."
m/beguiled, Provocative and hypnotic...Eastwood revels with spellbinding spunk in this suggestive military melodrama
m/behaving_badly_2014, A number of really talented people make appearances in the wretchedly unfunny teen sex comedy Behaving Badly; so many that you wonder if a producer has incriminating photos stashed somewhere.
m/behind_the_burly_q," Assembled as a rough oral history of a brief but transitional moment in American entertainment, Behind the Burly Q is as determinedly upbeat as the consummate showgirls at its heart."
m/behind_the_candelabra," The lifestyles of the rich, famous and queer get a provocative examination in Steven Soderbergh's 'Behind the Candelabra.'"
m/behind_the_mask_the_rise_of_leslie_vernon," Both funny and creepy, just like the best entries in the genre it spoofs."
m/behind_you," There are promising nuggets here, especially how they deal with unseen demons near the climax, and the film occasionally pulls off strong, interesting effects. Overall, however, Behind You never capitalizes on what works."
m/behold_a_pale_horse," Peck is very good, Quinn is superb, and everyone involved with this powerful movie should take a bow."
m/being_17," Calling to mind the sullen lovers of Wong Kar-wai's Happy Together, the young men of Being 17 are more gestural than verbal. Tchin intuitively favors movement over chatter, and he directs his young actors toward intimate, yearning performances."
m/being_at_home_with_claude," The movie tries to make Yves' decision into some kind of deep metaphysical statement, but actually it's just a tortured version of the old advice to live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse."
m/being_elmo_a_puppeteers_journey, Profile of exceptional performer charms with unexpected delights.
m/being_evel," Both a comprehensive personality profile, as well as a smart depiction of Americana."
m/being_flynn," There is honest feeling, genuine humanity and real intelligence in this movie, but there is also a sense of caution, of indecisiveness, that undermines its potential power."
m/being_frank_2019," Despite good performances, the film doesn't reach its potential. Given current sexual politics, you'd hope to see a stronger condemnation of the privileged attitude exuded by Gaffigan's character."
m/being_john_malkovich," Being John Malkovich is ingenious, different, beautifully directed and acted, and also very, very funny."
m/being_julia, A wildly uneven blend of '30s screwball comedies and the kind of Grand Guignol melodrama that made me wish Charles Busch was starring instead of the wildly uneven Bening.
m/being_there," The overall tone is one of light drama, and it's only through its situations that it becomes a sly, witty statement on society, politics and pop culture."
m/beirut," Beirut could be the start of a comeback for this old school genre, one that Gilroy himself helped usher into oblivion with his Jason Bourne screenplays"
m/bel_ami_2011," As George beds woman after woman, with the specific intent of moving up the social ladder, the seduction is non-existent. So too is the hedonism and debauchery of Paris in the 1890s."
m/believe-in-me," You will find it an evening well spent, uplifting with a lot of heartfelt feelings."
m/believe_2016," Faith-based holiday drama has familiar messages, violence."
m/believe_me, The movie loses its zip as it becomes more dramatic ...
m/bella," Scored to a relentless mix of Spanish and English pop anthems, cut like a Grudge freak-out, and performed with all the gusto of a Chespirito skit."
m/bellboy," The Bellboy is nearly silent, in what could easily be taken as a nod toward French comedy titan Jacques Tati."
m/belle_2014, An 18th C. tale of race and romance told in a sophisticated fashion reminiscent of the best of Jane Austen.
m/belle_de_jour," a fascination in the brilliance of its knowing detail about sexual attraction/revulsion, about the subtleties of desire"
m/belles_magical_world," Made for video sequel of sorts is OK, but no Beauty and the Beast."
m/bellflower," Muddled, overlong, indulgent in uninteresting ways and eventually afraid to go any place provocative, Bellflower has only a cool car and a promise of future filmmaking from talented first timers."
m/bells_are_ringing," Minnelli's last collaboration with Arthur Freed is an old-fashioned, moderately entertaining musical that suffers from lack of chemistry between Judy Holliday and Dean Martin."
m/belly," All of Williams's glitz, delicious eye candy as it is, eventually overshadows his own script."
m/beloved_2012, The carefree love life of a 1960s French mother is daringly juxtaposed with the amorous travails of her daughter several decades later in Beloved.
m/beloved_sisters_2015," Beloved Sisters moves at an almost breathless clip, without ever violating its characters' slow sense of time, which is defined by horse-drawn coaches and posted letters."
m/below, It's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt.
m/belzebuth, Belzebuth's script is undoubtedly a true disaster. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/ben," One of the ""better"" rat attack flicks, if that's a worthwhile distinction."
m/ben_hur_2016," A rousing, thrilling, and exhilarating epic in spite of the lethargic, stilted drama during its first hour. Morgan Freeman shows up as Ilderim to rescue both Ben-Hur and the film as well."
m/ben_is_back_2018," An uneven, but a deeply passionate film that features an A-list actress at the top of her game."
m/benchwarmers," Manages to never be boring even when it is a complete waste of talent, film stock and the audience's time and money."
m/bend_it_like_beckham," Gurinder Chadha's third film is an undemanding, unambitious comedy."
m/benda_bilili," Take the Buena Vista Social Club, add some wheelchairs and you have Staff Benda Bilili..."
m/beneath_2014," The title doesn't just refer to what lurks in the lake's still water. It's a guide to where Beneath's substance lies, the acid heart inside its plastic chest."
m/beneath_hill_60, Perhaps the tension of the situation is not exploited quite as much as one would hope but this is an ambitious project that will resonate.
m/beneath_the_darkness, Dennis Quaid tries to look villainous but he's no Jack Nicholson
m/beneath_the_harvest_sky, The film offers a solid sense of place and Gaudet and Pullapilly expertly use the jittery camerawork of Steven Calitri to infuse the proceedings with a nervy energy.
m/beneath_the_planet_of_the_apes," Suffers from Jaws 2 syndrome, attempting to replicate the beats of the first film too closely with much of the same cast reprising their roles and character ticks and because of that, it simply doesn't have its own fingerprint."
m/benhur," Ben-Hur (1959) is MGM's three and a half hour, wide-screen epic Technicolor blockbuster - a Biblical tale, subtitled A Tale of the Christ. Director William Wyler's film was a retelling of the spectacular silent film of the same name..."
m/benjamin," A hilariously knowing tale of love, identity, and monks."
m/benji, Delightful family comedy starring the cuddly dog star.
m/benji_2018, Too bad there's no Oscar for Best Animal Performance of the Year. Benji would win hands -- er paws -- down.
m/benji_off_the_leash," Thinks a happy ending is not for the boy to get to keep the dog, but for the dog to go to Hollywood the first family film [that ends with] the father getting arrested."
m/benny_and_joon," The movie suggests that love and magic can overcome madness, and for at least the length of the film I was prepared to accept that. Much of the credit for that goes to Depp..."
m/bennys_video," In some ways, the portrait of his parents is even more chilling."
m/beowulf," I came, saw, had my retinas fried, and was conquered."
m/berberian_sound_studio_2012," In just two films Strickland has established a striking, unusual voice; long may he continue to find opportunities to make this boundary-stretching, genre-fuddling work."
m/bereavement, Bereavement -- miraculously as dull as its title -- is neither far gone enough to be funny nor well thought-out enough to be disturbing.
m/berlin-symphony-of-a-great-city," More of a montage of images than an actual movie, this is a deeply fascinating documentary."
m/berlin_i_love_you," This anthology effort is too long, offers too little, and seems like a largely wasted opportunity."
m/berlin_syndrome, The harrowing drama Berlin Syndrome makes room for nuance and depth.
m/bernard_and_huey," As you might hope for a film with a script from the great Jules Feiffer, Dan Mirvish's Bernard and Huey bristles with anxious, circuitous, hilarious talk."
m/bernie_2011," Pitch-perfect performances by Shirley MacLaine and an unusually restrained Jack Black hold together this offbeat true-crime saga, but Linklater's keen eye for human eccentricity flowers most memorably on the periphery."
m/beside_bowie_the_mick_ronson_story, Of interest to Ronson or Bowie fans but hardly enlightening.
m/beside_still_waters," With this exceptional debut, [director Chris Lowell] deserves to be considered one of most promising new talents in American independent cinema."
m/bessie_2015," There are three good reasons to watch HBO's Bessie: Queen Latifah, Mo'Nique, and Khandi Alexander."
m/best_friends," So far, this sounds like a series of fairly predictable scenes. But they're redeemed by the writing and acting. The dialogue doesn't sound like reprocessed sitcom, and there are charming moments."
m/best_in_show," The jokes in Best in Show are somewhat one-dimensional, but they hit their target."
m/best_little_whorehouse_in_texas, A bawdy good time. All but stolen by Charles Durning as the sidestepping governor and Dom DeLuise as the leader of the decency police.
m/best_night_ever, Best Night Ever seems marketed to women but made for frat house consumption.
m/best_of_enemies_2015, The on-camera clashes between William F. Buckley Jr. and Gore Vidal are vividly and entertainingly recounted in this fascinating documentary.
m/best_of_everything," Based on Rona Jaffe's trashy best-seller, this glossy Fox melodrama has an all-star cast, with Crawford as castrating boss and four appealing actresses: Hope Lange, Suzy parker, Diane Baker, and Martha Hyer."
m/best_seller," One of the edgiest, most suspenseful thrillers of the 1980's....Woods is amazing"
m/best_worst_movie," The debacle that was Troll 2 has given birth to Best Worst Movie, easily the most enjoyable documentary you'll see all year."
m/best_years_of_our_lives," This is intelligent, admirably unsentimental and utterly involving for its full three-hour running time."
m/bestiaire_2012," Mr. Ct ... forces you to look at the often unseen. It may not be pretty, but it is essential viewing."
m/bethany," During its most inventive moments, ""Bethany"" resembles one of the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels."
m/bethlehem_2013, ...a muddled and downright confusing endeavor that's rife with half-baked elements...
m/betsys_wedding, Most of the people who see this will own funnier home videos of wedding disasters.
m/better_days_2019," While taking an emotional toll, the all-too-realistic bullying scenes also make the film more realistic and empathetic for audience members."
m/better_living_through_chemistry," Good work remains despite obvious obstacles, though it's disheartening to see the production settle for less when closing out this entertaining feature, diminishing the few highlights it delivers."
m/better_luck_tomorrow, It tries to stuff in so many different subjects and genres that you'll stop caring about what start off to be interesting characters.
m/better_than_chocolate," Plays like a 'very special episode' of a sitcom. That is, one with explicit nudity and sex."
m/better_this_world, A case of solid journalism that happens to be cinematically interesting.
m/better_watch_out," Best described as Home Alone meets Michael Haneke's Funny Games, the sadistic horror comedy Safe Neighborhood is the kind of film that's tough to categorize but easy to enjoy."
m/bettie_page_reveals_all," It tends to lurch distractingly, as if Mr. Mori were still trying to figure out how to piece the whole thing together."
m/betting_on_zero," It may not be entirely inspiring, but Betting on Zero captures the everyone-for-themselves desperation that would make any wronged individual furious, be they jilted employee or frustrated stockholder."
m/betty_blue," Like Zorg, we are bedazzled by Betty's bright eyes, big moue and wild child's ways."
m/between_love_and_goodbye," Between Love & Goodbye tells of the ill-fated romance between a pair of East Village transplants with 2 percent body fat, zero personality and even less chemistry."
m/between_strangers," Except for heartfelt performances by Sophia Loren and Pete Postlethwaite as her wheelchair-bound husband, Between Strangers is an awful cheat."
m/between_the_lines," There's still sweet tang, a rising waft of authenticity. The fictional Main Line is losing its counterculture cred-the 1960s had been over for a while-but life, and loving, goes on. Like Jeff Goldblum."
m/between_two_ferns_the_movie, [T]here are enough big laughs packed into this scattershot adventure - structured around Zach Galifianakis' painfully awkward celebrity sit-downs - to warrant a viewing.
m/between_us_2012," Between Us is strongly recommended for best friends, married couples, and those contemplating marriage at some future date."
m/between_us_2017," Illingworth aims to capture a vital relationship at a crucial turning point, but Between Us fails because Dianne is half-formed."
m/between_worlds_2018," There's so much to like about Between Worlds, and on paper it sounds like exactly the right movie to channel Cage's late-career mayhem, but in practice it's flat and flimsy."
m/beverly_hills_cop, ...provides more action and more laughs than most recent comedy thrillers.
m/beverly_hills_cop_2," The film seems... to be a precisely timed affair: so many seconds for this, so many for that, and the natural flow of the story be damned."
m/beverly_hills_cop_3, Whatever juice is left in the Cop franchise or in the once unstoppable career of Eddie Murphy peters out ignominiously in this poor excuse for a sequel.
m/beverly_hills_ninja, There's at least one consolation: David Spade is not in the movie.
m/beware_of_mr_baker," It's not easy to get past the shield of celebrity, and it's even harder to get past a persona as permanently entrenched as this one to see something genuine and unguarded, and that's what we get here."
m/beware_the_gonzo, High school reporter exposes bully in teen comedy with edge.
m/bewitched, Contains a freshness not usually seen in your typical Television series remake.
m/beyond, The masterpiece of the great Italian horror director Lucio Fulci.
m/beyond_a_reasonable_doubt," Lang's most austere film, reducing the characters to pawns arbitrarily shifted in demonstration of a fascinating theorem."
m/beyond_belief_2008," In Beth Murphy's intriguing docu Beyond Belief, two Massachusetts women whose husbands were killed on 9/11 reach out to victims on the other side -- Afghan widows."
m/beyond_borders, This slickly superficial epic ultimately degrades the important subject it cavalierly employs as mere background for its centerpiece romance...crass and meretricious.
m/beyond_clueless_2014," Summer Camp's original score is the cherry on top to this vibrant, funny and subversive analysis of post-John Hughes American teen movies."
m/beyond_hatred," Meyrou's suitably sombre film leaves you with a sense of enormous respect for a couple refusing to be consumed by hatred, prepared instead to offer their forgiveness."
m/beyond_outrage," If Takeshi Kitano does go forward with the rumored third volume, hopefully he'll conceive of some fresh angle on this increasingly dry material."
m/beyond_rangoon," Because the film is well acted and directed, and the Malaysian locations are exotic and seductive, I got involved even though the story ... was so clearly concocted."
m/beyond_skyline_2017," at first retelling the original's LA invasion from street (and underground) level, and then borrowing from the follow-ups to The Purge both lead actor Frank Grillo, and a see-what-sticks approach to sequel making."
m/beyond_the_black_rainbow_2012," A welcome attempt to bring back the days of El Topo and Eraserhead, when night owls embraced directors who wanted to screw with viewers' heads, not just the ones who screwed up their chances for auteristic posterity."
m/beyond_the_edge_2013," The skilful combination of old and new footage, almost seamlessly spliced together, still provides riveting material for viewers in a more cynical age."
m/beyond_the_gates," A passion project for those involved, it is angry and earnest and highlights an episode the international community have never quite dealt with: how it sat back and watched as thousands of Africans were killed."
m/beyond_the_gates_2016," The film is a great homage to the Italian horror films of the '80s influenced by House By the Cemetery, The Beyond, and The Gate with a touch of Don Coscarelli's Phantasm thrown into the mix."
m/beyond_the_hills_2012," A pretty serious misstep, overthought and overwrought, with some big ideas buried beneath a leaden approach and a cast that simply can't enliven material that never manages to lurch to life."
m/beyond_the_lights," [Prince-Bythewood's] film is more interesting than it is good. But if ""interesting"" includes 50 alluring close-ups of Parker giving hungry eyes to Mbatha-Raw, then ""good"" is overrated."
m/beyond_the_mask," It wants to be a faith-based film, a historical drama, and an action/adventure movie at the same time. Those three things are blended together awkwardly, leading to shifts in tone that can be jarring."
m/beyond_the_mat," The wrestlers are cannier than Blaustein probably gives them credit for; they seem to be offering up their backstage lives to him in ways that mimic the soppiest of melodramas, and he falls for it."
m/beyond_the_poseidon_adventure," Beyond the Poseidon Adventure comes off as a virtual remake of the 1972 original, without that film's mounting suspense and excitement."
m/beyond_the_reach, The movie tries too hard to promise nail-crunching terror that it never really delivers.
m/beyond_the_sea," While Beyond doesn't go much beyond standard biopic status, Spacey's singing stays with you long after the credits have rolled."
m/beyond_the_valley_of_the_dolls," A psychedelic wow that serves up the free love, plunging necklines, androgynous boys, and lusty lezzies of the era with a narcotized abandon."
m/beyond_the_visible_hilma_af_klint," One needn't have a B.F.A. to see the striking resemblances between Klint's works, painted years earlier, and those of vastly more lauded male artists who came later"
m/bhaag_milkha_bhaag," Mehra is brilliant at his craft; he infuses realism into drama, and explores characters so deeply and sensitively through tragedy and triumph, that it sparks an emotional deluge."
m/bhool_bhulaiyaa, A performance of profound and unmitigated dreadfulness.
m/bhoot," The scenes unfold slowly and deliberately, there are long tracks of complete silence and minimal use of dialogue that together create an uncanny mood."
m/bhutto," O'Hara's doc not only recounts the leader's life and career; it also offers a fascinating look back at the history of her troubled nation, wisely placing its current political volatility in an easily graspable context."
m/bicentennial_man," If anyone's going to animate a machine, it might as well be Robin Williams."
m/bickford_shmecklers_cool_ideas," Packing quite a bit of wit, wisdom, craziness, and creativity into its slick-looking and efficient frame, Bickford Schmeckler's Cool Ideas is a bizarrely charming little diversion."
m/bicycle_thieves, The Bicycle Thief is one of those wonderful titles whose power does not sink in until the film is over.
m/bidder_70," A powerful, empathetic portrait of a selfless, planetary patriot willing to sacrifice his liberty for the sake of Mother Earth's long-term prospects."
m/big," This is mainstream Hollywood filmmaking at its best -- packed with intelligence, humour and pathos."
m/big_ass_spider," A fun, affectionate tribute to b-movie creature features."
m/big_bad_love," ... grounded by honest, expressive performances from Howard and Winger, who achieve a tempestuous chemistry. It also makes you want to pop open a cold one."
m/big_bad_mama," There's still a rustic style, off-kilter humor, and fluid pacing to Big Bad Mama that keeps the flick entirely watchable more than 20 years after it sauntered into the drive-ins."
m/big_bad_wolves_2013," amidst all the thrilling entertainment and black comedy to be found here, there are also serious reflections on Israel's aggressive sense of victimhood and historically rooted longing for revenge (passed down from father to son)."
m/big_bounce," Does crime novelist Elmore Leonard sell the movie rights to his novels only after the filmmakers agree to use The Isely Brothers' ""It's Your Thing"" on the soundtrack?"
m/big_boys_gone_bananas_2012, An eye-opening look at the way the U.S. media fell lockstep behind Dole's claims.
m/big_bus, The 'star-studded' cast of familiar faces is one of the conventions of disaster movies that writers Cohen and Fred Freeman have stuck to
m/big_chill," The ease with which the group falls back into their old patterns of trust and familiarity after an awkwardly long period of separation is narratively convenient, but not really probable."
m/big_clock," Zesty performances and superb art direction -- the Janoth Publications building, complete with the titular object, is an architectural marvel -- are just two of the +es in this riveting film that builds to a satisfying conclusion."
m/big_country," As Charlton Heston explained ..., 'it's connected with the American ethos - America was made for Westerns.'"
m/big_daddy," The actors bring an appealing energy to their simplistic roles, enough so to wring laughs from the most Sandler-resistant audience members."
m/big_driver," Solid star turn, eerie production values, even a killer ending. Nice symmetry, Steve."
m/big_easy," One of the smartest, sexiest thrill rides ever, with a spicy cajun flavor."
m/big_eden," Beautifully filmed and warmly scored, the movie is a treat for the eyes and ears."
m/big_eyes," An incredible return to form for Tim Burton, who once again has found an outsider hero worth filming, and who here does some of his finest work in bringing her to life."
m/big_fat_liar," Any film that can survive cameos from Urkel, Screech, and Lee Majors (answering to ""Grandpa"" and ""Father Time"") relatively intact deserves credit."
m/big_foot_the_lost_coast_tapes_2012, The long and inglorious list of Bigfoot movies just got longer and more inglorious.
m/big_fur," Wayne uses a light touch and a humorous tone to cover his subjects and, to his credit, everyone is given the dignity and respect that they deserve, yet I wanted more."
m/big_game_2015," ""Big Game"" isn't as witty as it thinks it is, rarely transcends the very movies it wants to knock, and its intentionally hamfisted approach isn't particularly endearing."
m/big_gay_musical, There's a certain boilerplate quality to The Big Gay Musical but it's also a lot of fun...
m/big_hero_6," Baymax turns out to be a formidable weapon in this gorgeously realised tale of boy and 'bot, and the bond that develops between them."
m/big_hit," A ripe, noisy action flick, loaded with block-clearing explosions and testosterone-charged showdowns."
m/big_house," Despite its flaws, for those who love this genre it's a must see film."
m/big_kill," Aside from being full of holes for one, the plot concludes with a resolution that's both anticlimactic and predictable. Additionally, the film also has several underdeveloped subplots..."
m/big_liar_on_campus," I didn't know who Ryan Pinkston was before I watched Full of It, and now I pray to the cinema gods I will never have to wince through another one of his insufferable movies again."
m/big_miracle, Miracle eschews black and white - even the Inupiat have ulterior motives - for shades of grey.
m/big_mommas_house," It's The Nutty Professor meets Mrs. Doubtfire, but without the humor of the former or the heart of the latter."
m/big_mommas_like_father_like_son, Whoever demanded a third instalment of Lawrence's mirthless mash-up of weak gags and cross-dressing horrors should be imprisoned and forced to watch it on repeat until they repent. Avoid.
m/big_muddy_2011," Atmospheric and absorbing, this well-crafted whodunit is rather reminiscent of Red Rock West."
m/big_night, The movie is like a great meal overlayed with sublime conversation and mingled with a little goofiness.
m/big_nothing, ...one of the most refreshingly mean-spirited comedies to come around in quite some time.
m/big_one," If there's a serious flaw... it lies in Moore's tendency to mistake self-glamorization for credibility. Much more so than in 'Roger and Me,' he's the star of the show here, and don't think he doesn't know it."
m/big_picture," Partly romance, partly fantasy, partly satire on what passes for life in Hollywood -- and all charm -- this movie even has a perfect title."
m/big_red_one, There's a reason Fuller found it hard to get gigs in the US through the 70's; his pulp fiction style just didn't play anymore.
m/big_shot_caller," Hallmark Channel formula is about all there is of a plot, and the leads are horrendously miscast"
m/big_shots, The result is more entertaining than you might think.
m/big_sky_2015, A solid thriller with a very good turn by [Bella] Thorne and [Kyra] Sedgewick.
m/big_star_nothing_can_hurt_me, Should satisfy both long-term acolytes and those newly curious of Big Star's timeless artistry.
m/big_steal," Siegel packs lots of chases and action into 72 minutes, with a great ending."
m/big_stone_gap," Nothing feels believable in ""Big Stone Gap,"" a bungled, charm-free look at small-town life in the South in the late '70s."
m/big_sur_2013," Big Sur achieves one of the trickier challenges in cinema, dramatising the inner demons of a character awash in melancholy and addiction."
m/big_tease, The Big Tease perfectly captures and lampoons the essence of Hollywood.
m/big_top_pee_wee," Fun for children, embarrassing for adults, especially now knowing Pee-Wee's illegal indulgences."
m/big_trail," John Ford recommended to his friend Walsh bit-part actor Marion Morrison for the lead, and for his first starring role he took the name John Wayne..."
m/big_trouble_in_little_china," Special effects don't mean much unless we care about the characters who are surrounded by them, and in this movie the characters often seem to exist only to fill up the foregrounds."
m/big_wednesday," Ambitious in goal, John Millius' tale suffers from an inconsistent tone, trying to be elegiac, nostalgic, and mythical in depicting the impact of Vietnam and aging on a clique of three surfers between 1962 and 1974 but the acting and imagery are good."
m/bigger_splash, It is a film that seems to externalize David Hockney's erotic imagination and the anxiety that comes with it.
m/bigger_stronger_faster_asterisk, More scrupulously reported than your average Michael Moore film but every bit as entertaining.
m/bigger_than_the_sky," Painfully well-intentioned, the film is undone by a lead character who undermines any goodwill earned by the performances of John Corbett, Amy Smart, Clare Higgins, Allan Corduner, Patty Duke and Sean Astin."
m/biggie_and_tupac," Broomfield seems to uncover a massive scoop here, revealing the multitude of people involved and the possible motivations behind the killings of his titular subjects."
m/biker_boyz, Meagan Good is a good thing...Biker Boyz ain't so good.
m/bikes_vs_cars," Bikes vs. Cars is no cinematic masterpiece, and it veers toward cheerleading in the last act, but it's an important film nonetheless, that will get you thinking about -- and perhaps rethinking -- how you get around."
m/bikram_yogi_guru_predator," It doesn't say much about abusive charlatans, their enablers, and their victims, that we don't already know."
m/bill_2016, Enough gags are splattered around to ensure a decent rate of stickage ...
m/bill_and_ted_face_the_music, Not as classic as the first two but not as bad as it could have been.
m/bill_and_teds_bogus_journey, EXCELLENT! (But not quite as EXCELLENT! as the first.)
m/bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure," It's not at all important, but it's still a great guilty pleasure."
m/bill_burr_im_sorry_you_feel_that_way, It's not an all-ages comedy special. It will entertain the grownups.
m/bill_burr_paper_tiger," [Bill] Burr is equally the guy who thinks it's funny to tease feminist protestors and the man fighting his own devil to be a good father. He doesn't have to be right, he just has to be funny, and Paper Tiger is a furious work of art."
m/bill_cunningham_new_york_2010," A slight, glancing, yet subtly wrought slice of New York life. And it seems likely that the exceedingly modest Cunningham would want it that way."
m/billion_dollar_brain," No mais fraco exemplar da série, Harry Palmer perde a personalidade irreverente, enfrenta uma ameaça absurda encabeçada por uma caricatura em um filme aborrecido e sem pé nem cabeça."
m/billu-barber, It is dedicated to the proposition that god-like celebrities are ordinary folks at heart. Groans all around.
m/billy_bathgate," Despite the shaggy dog sense of fun, Bathgate fades before you've left your seat."
m/billy_elliot," Illustrates how classic storylines, in the right hands, can work over and over again."
m/billy_liar," Finally, of course, the film is Tom Courtenay's. In this, his finest part so far, no praise could be too much and yet all seems impossible."
m/billy_lynns_long_halftime_walk," It's a radiant debut for young newcomer Joe Alwyn, who plays a Texan war hero uneasy in his own land. It's a shakier curtain-raising for Lee's ambitious weaponising of new technologies."
m/billy_madison, Adam Sandler being a total idiot for an hour and a half. Good fun.
m/billys_hollywood_screen_kiss," ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" isn't at all deep. But in its cheerful, fun-loving way, it reminds us that in our endlessly self-referential, image-conscious pop culture, fantasy is what makes the world go 'round."
m/bing_fung_chung_sang_chi_mun_2014," Hopefully, the second instalment of this two-parter film, slated for release later this year, has got the puerile humour out of its system to focus on only the action."
m/biodome," Film school grad Jason Bloom makes his directing debut, but his inexperience shows."
m/bird," Even though, thematically, the movie won't come clear, Eastwood has succeeded so thoroughly in communicating his love of his subject, and there's such vitality in the performances, that we walk out elated, juiced on the actors and the music."
m/bird-of-paradise, A lavish South Seas romance with a thin story line but wonderful graphics is about all RKO could muster when filming Richard Walton Tully's ancient play for the first time.
m/bird_box," The actors are fine, but the problem is that it's hard to care about the interaction of the people inside, because nothing they do matters."
m/bird_people," Two lost souls flock together, sort of, in an ambitious French film that takes flight in some highly unusual ways."
m/bird_with_the_crystal_plumage," [It] has the energy to support its elaborateness and the decency to display its devices with style. Something from each of its better models has stuck, and it is pleasant to rediscover old horrors in such handsome new décor."
m/birdcage, One of those rare motion pictures with side-splitting laughs where the humor never stays dormant for long.
m/birdemic_shock_and_terror-2008," Question: What's the difference between ""Birdemic"" and bird droppings? No one asks you to pay for the latter (yet)."
m/birders_the_central_park_effect, Birders vividly captures the distinctive colors and markings of a vast number of bird species and the equally individualized personalities of those watching them within the confines of Central Park.
m/birdman_2014," Birdman, though, becomes funnier and more poignant the longer it lasts."
m/birdman_of_alcatraz, Lancaster is wonderful; a tribute to the human spirit.
m/birds_of_prey_2020," May not be the most powerful or poignant movie you'll see this year, but as a foray into female empowerment, it is a buoyant, bullshit-free blast."
m/birdy," Quiet, thoughtful, and really quite touching. Cage and Modine do some great work together. And that Peter Gabriel score!"
m/birth, No one in the film comes across as a flesh-and-blood character...Birth is overdressed with nowhere to go.
m/birth_of_a_nation," We must credit Griffith for expanding the concept of film, since previous Nickelodeon films were limited to one reel"
m/birth_of_the_dragon," It wants to be a character study, an explication of martial arts philosophy and an action picture ... But the film never really gets fully juiced until the climax ..."
m/birth_of_the_living_dead," The Birth of the modern zombie film wasn't scary. It was downright hilarious, according to this smart new doc."
m/birthday_girl," Though the story's slight and veers toward an inevitable conclusion, this Soviet sexcapade is worth your rubles."
m/bit, Nicole Maines delivers a commanding presence in Bit as the film becomes the queer feminist vampire movie that we've been needing for so long.
m/bitch_2017, A fearless film that explores the explosion of the nuclear family and gender paradigms as only a scrappy little indie can.
m/bite_2016," At its best, and it gets pretty good after a really rocky start, ""Bite"" is a clever gorefest with some creative twists and turns."
m/bite_the_bullet," Bite the Bullet may be many things, but boring it's not."
m/bitter-moon," During 2 1/2 hours of choppy waters, soured love affairs and seasickly moods, the controversial director's Lust Boat becomes the Loathe Boat. By then, it's way too late for Dramamine."
m/bitter_harvest_2017," The film is an awkward mix of swashbuckling love story and polemic, painted in very broad strokes."
m/bitter_tears_of_petra_von_kant," You can understand why (Petra Von Kant) is viewed by many as one of Fassbinder's masterpieces. Not bad for ten days' work, anyway."
m/bitter_victory, Nicholas Ray directs with an uncompromising austerity that puts the hypocrisy and the bitter inhumanity of war in focus...
m/biutiful," Bardem is superb, but this is a slog, lurching despite high-pressure editing and utterly oblivious to how the harsh-poetic compassion from Amores Perros has hardened into a rather gloating hunger for suffering."
m/black," Bhansali built a visually beautiful film around the story of ""The Miracle Worker."" It is hard to imagine such an elegant and satisfying film coming from the Bollywood system."
m/black-and-white1999," Tyson and Downey have a scene that is one of the most uncomfortable, embarrassing pieces of work I've seen in a while, and I have seen a LOT of community theater."
m/black_47," Daly's restrained, pared-down style is the opposite of flashy exploitation cinema, but watching these bastions of lethally repressive British rule get some overdue comeuppance is similarly stirring."
m/black_balloon," This auspicious Oz import is a sign of bright, young filmmaking in Australia."
m/black_book, Hollywood-honed tech smarts and European character sensibilities mesh entertainingly in pacy WWII resistance thriller Black Book.
m/black_butterflies_2011," As far as middlebrow biopics go, it may not break any molds, but it's a reasonably sensitive and occasionally insightful look into the mind and psyche of an impassioned and deeply troubled artist."
m/black_butterfly_2017," Likely to divide audience with its twists and turns, but it's rarely dull, perhaps best appreciated as a higher minded exploitation effort than a brain-bleeder with occasionally iffy working parts."
m/black_caesar," Mr. Williamson, in short, can't be blamed for the plot contrivances that hinge mostly on action and bloodshed."
m/black_cauldron, The backgrounds are as richly textured and detailed as in any other Disney film.
m/black_christmas," Morgan borrows Christmas-specific nastiness from a wide range of fright flicks, but the result is less than the sum of its parts."
m/black_christmas_2019," Black Christmas creates its own stamp due to several committed performances, Takal's assured direction, the witty script, and the clever weaving of its feminist ideas into the tropes of the horror genre. Recommended."
m/black_coffee_2015," Middling rom-com tackles ambition and romance, heavy themes."
m/black_cop," For all its visceral images, the film's raw power isn't matched by equally provocative ideas."
m/black_dahlia, A literally ripping good yarn is undercut by some lackluster performances and late-inning overripe melodrama.
m/black_death-2010," This is bracing, often brutal stuff, set in a world where, as Ulric says, 'God has slipped over the horizon.'"
m/black_dog," Hey, you like 18-wheelers (Have you driven a big Ford lately?), country-and-western music, and an All-American meal (as in meat loaf), then here's a film for you."
m/black_dynamite," Generally humorless and pointless, devoid as the film is of any commentary on the genre to which it's paying loving tribute."
m/black_friday_2005, A fact-based procedural whose drama gets lost amid its analytical detail.
m/black_hawk_down, The battle/rescue is something people will be talking about for a long time.
m/black_knight," If Black Knight is an indication of what's to come, Lawrence's box-office reign may soon be over."
m/black_magic_for_white_boys," Black Magic for White Boys interprets us, irritates us, worries us. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/black_mask," Weak plot, no logic, and bad dubbing to boot. But ""Black Mask"" has one of the highest energy quotients you'll find in any action thriller around."
m/black_mass_2015," Johnny Depp gives an utterly chilling performance as the notorious James ""Whitey"" Bulger in Boston-set crime drama Black Mass."
m/black_moon_rising," Cokliss's direction strains for a stylishness it doesn't achieve, yet his fundamentally straightforward style brings out the abstract design of the plot."
m/black_narcissus," Beautiful technicolor film, with a slow-moving, but intriguing plot."
m/black_nativity," For anyone who prefers their assertive homilies to crust over like a syrupy sweet, this loose adaptation of Langston Hughes's beloved holiday tradition will come on like a dream fulfilled."
m/black_november," A scattering of Hollywood actors, an important subject -- how Nigeria came to be the failing state it is today and Big Oil's role in it -- but a rather clumsy film."
m/black_ops_2020," the concrete stairwell in Paton's film rings hollow with the questionable morality of war, as these highly trained yet haunted men and women are forced, step by bloody step, either to retrace and reiterate past sins or, somehow, to rectify them."
m/black_or_white, A broad but touching dramedy about the racial barriers that divide us and the family ties that bind.
m/black_orpheus," A mixed bag then, but the highlights are memorable."
m/black_out_2012," Packed with colorful characters and gnarly plot twists, Arne Toonen's movie is a stylish, bloody romp."
m/black_panther_2018," The women of Black Panther do so much throughout the film, all while being funny, sensuous, smart and strong."
m/black_pond, Black Pond is an adventurous offering from first-time directors on a small budget.
m/black_rock_2011," Working from a ruthlessly efficient script by husband Mark Duplass, Aselton effortlessly sets up the women's reunion scenario before effectively flipping the action from drama to thriller."
m/black_rose_2017," Ill-considered, badly-acted and deadly-dull vanity thriller from a body builder with the cheek to name himself Alexander Nevsky"
m/black_sabbath," Uneven, but the 'Drop of Water' sequence is about the creepiest thing ever filmed"
m/black_sea," It's well shot, tense and solidly entertaining. But watertight it definitely isn't."
m/black_sheep," If you're in the mood for something sillier, Black Sheep awaits. There are plenty of laughs, but don't let that fool you: This one's not for the weak of stomach."
m/black_site_2019," The resulting genre mash-up involves Lovecraftian lore, and - as magic prevents firearms being used on the base - plenty of martial arts and swordplay, as well as some literal Hammer Time (à la The Raid 2)."
m/black_snake_moan, Brewer's hard-bitten drama isn't merely defiant; it spits fire at America's phony media-fed version of itself.
m/black_stallion," The film represents a studied, sophisticated approach to instinctual emotions: it's carefully, calculatingly naive, and amazingly it works."
m/black_sunday," Mario Bava's first film is gorgiously photographed and often eerie, but it fails to scare much by today's standards."
m/black_swan_2010, It's as if Aronofsky has a direct pipeline into my nightmares.
m/black_waters_of_echos_pond," These waters are gory and sexually suggestive, and they overfloweth with unoriginality."
m/blackballed-the-bobby-dukes-story," Does it give you a finer appreciation for the 'sport' of paintball? Probably not, but like paintball, it's fun even when it's messy."
m/blackbird_2012," ...the film ultimately feels much, much longer than its 103 minutes."
m/blackbird_2015," At no point does anyone in the film even vaguely resemble an actual 21st-century teenager; when these kids text each other, it comes across like science fiction."
m/blackboard_jungle," It gives a blood-curdling, nightmarish picture or monstrous disorder in a public school. And it leaves one wondering wildly whether such out-of-hand horrors can be."
m/blackfish_2013," Tilikum, whose last victim Dawn Brancheau died in 2010, is still performing at SeaWorld - after watching this documentary, you'll think long and hard about taking your family to see him."
m/blackhat," A sensuous, ravishing collection of images that occasionally give way to murky plotting and dull characters, ""Blackhat"" is a minor (but palpably hypnotic) film from a major American action auteur."
m/blackkklansman," A heady hybrid of comedy, polemic and period crime drama."
m/blackthorn, Mateo Gil certainly can be held responsible for turning the iconic outlaw into a paper-thin Clint Eastwood-Unforgiven clich.
m/blackwood_2013, A forgettable addition to the proud British tradition of haunted-country-pile movies.
m/blacula, Blaxploitation meets vampire movie that's formulaic and full of holes.
m/blade_ii," Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star, but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation."
m/blade_of_the_immortal," Further proof that of all the genres he dabbles in, samurai cinema is the one that brings out the grandest entertainer in Miike. Here's to 100 more."
m/blade_runner," A rare masterpiece in both the sci-fi and film noir genres. Blade Runner makes you think, makes you question reality, and makes you return to watch it again and again."
m/blade_runner_1982, This remains an astonishing achievement: a Dystopian sci-fi epic that is also one of the best film noirs of recent times.
m/blade_runner_2049," If Blade Runner gave us the world, Blade Runner 2049 has come to fill in the universe."
m/blade_trinity," Parker Posey, in a series of increasingly scary hair-dos, [gives] a stumbling, zoned-out performance that could easily be interpreted as a cry for help."
m/blades_of_glory," When faced with Will Arnett and Jon Heder, you can sense Ferrell is overcompensating on purpose."
m/blair_witch," The idea that a secret sequel could bring a long-stale franchise like this back to life is, frankly, the most surprising thing to happen to horror in ages."
m/blair_witch_project, What becomes especially impressive about Blair Witch is how relentlessly it sticks to its vision.
m/blame_2018," It's impressive enough that 22-year-old Quinn Shephard wrote, directed, produced, edited and stars in the high-school melodrama ""Blame."" It's almost a bonus that the movie's good."
m/blame_it_on_rio, Stuff that goes on in this movie is illegal nowadays.
m/blame_it_on_the_bellboy, A lightweight ensemble comedy in which ingenious plotting is let down by weak dialog and stop-go direction that largely squanders the talent involved.
m/blancanieves, A bold re-imagining of the Grimm Brothers' Snow White legend transmitted in exquisite black and white with upbeat paso dobles and flamenco rhythms
m/blank-city, A well-researched celebration of No Wave cinema in all its grainy Super-8 glory.
m/blank_check, Boy spends a million dollars in lame '90s comedy; peril.
m/blankman, Damon Wayans loses credibility in 90 minute movie shocker!
m/blast_from_the_past," The movie is funny and entertaining in all the usual ways, yes, but I was grateful that it tried for more: that it was actually about something, that it had an original premise, that it used satire and irony and had sly undercurrents."
m/blaze_2018, Hands down the best movie of its kind since Inside Llewyn Davis.
m/blazing_saddles," Blazing Saddles has no dominant personality, and it looks as if it includes every gag thought up in every story conference. Whether good, bad, or mild, nothing was thrown out."
m/bleach_2018," While clearly made for a dedicated fanbase, unlike some more recent anime live-action adaptations, one of the greatest assets of Bleach is how cohesively it outlines its mythology for the uninitiated."
m/bleak_street," [A] sense of surreality within a mode of social realism (the scenario, believe it or not, was actually inspired by true event) ... gives the movie its off-kilter power."
m/bleed_2016," The filmmakers handle their material efficiently, but it's hard to imagine anyone familiar with the genre finding Bleed fresh or as vividly scary as its predecessors."
m/bleed_for_this," If you ever yearned to see a version of 'Million Dollar Baby"" that has a completely feel-good last reel, this may be it."
m/bleeding_heart_2015," There may not be much surprising here, but this is a smartly sensitive depiction of abuse and redemption that never descends into caricature."
m/bleeding_steel," [It] is impossible to gauge what type of audience, other than the die-hard Chan completists, will feel wholly satisfied by this schizophrenic genre hodgepodge."
m/blended," Purees your brain for two hours...proudly and pointedly credited as 'A Frank Coraci Movie'-not a film, y'hear? Nerd-os, go home!"
m/bless_me_ultima_2012, The film's interest in social themes remains background fodder within a far more generic good-versus-evil narrative.
m/bless_the_child, A feature length production of stale dialogue with a weak protagonist.
m/blessed_child," Captures the corrosiveness of mass group-think movements, which are frequently as successful at tearing people apart as they are at bringing them together."
m/blessed_is_the_match," Her story has inspired millions, so why does she comes across as such a pill in the new documentary Blessed is the Match: The Life and Death of Hannah Senesh?"
m/blind-chance," There's no room in Blind Chance's deterministic universe for character or personal choice, which may be why the film feels less fleshed-out, more schematic than some of Kieslowski's others."
m/blind_2015," Any emotional involvement with any of the ... situations or characters is relegated to the back burner, turning the film into a somewhat clinical narrative puzzle until all the cards are on the table."
m/blind_2017," Moore's and Baldwin's forceful personalities power their performances, and these evenly matched partners have now invigorated both a convoluted thriller (The Juror) and a predictable romance (Blind)."
m/blind_dating," There's actually a sweet little romantic comedy at the core of Blind Dating, fighting its way to get out of the cruder, crasser outer shell."
m/blind_fury," the unacknowledged adaptation of the Zato Ichi films, which features Rutger Hauer as a blind swordsman who wanders the roads of America, helps reunite a small boy with his father, and wastes more mob henchman than you can shake a white cane at."
m/blind_spot_hitlers_secretary, It just may be one of cinema's most grotesque exposes of denial.
m/blinded_by_the_light, A Technicolor ode to the power of music so deeply tender and heartfelt that it disarms even the most misanthropic critic's instincts.
m/blindsight," Gorgeous mountain photography frames this predictably heartwarming look at a group of sightless Tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb the 23,000-foot-tall Lhakpa Ri, one of Mount Everest's highest peaks."
m/blindspotting," And just like that, Carlos López Estrada is a filmmaker to watch."
m/bling_2016," Horrible messages, nonstop chaotic action in animated dud."
m/blinky_bill_the_movie," Hey kids! If your parents reveal plans to put you anywhere near Blinky Bill the Movie this school holidays, you are quite within your rights to ask why you are being punished in this way."
m/bliss_2019," [A] sleazy, gory, full-speed-ahead acid-trip of a movie with a 16mm sheen and reckless punk vibe."
m/blithe_spirit," Passably good, but it should have been better, what with Rex Harrison, Constance Cummings, and Margaret Rutherford reading the Noel Coward lines."
m/blitz_2011, Statham's cockney Kojak amuses. But Blitz's hardboiled detective story feels as much of a dinosaur as its lead character and constant shifts of tone make it a tough film to love.
m/block_party, Unique in the manner in which it salutes African-American culture and unity while at the same time exhibiting an exalted openness that makes it clear everyone's invited to take part in the merriment.
m/blockers," Under Cannon's direction, and with the spirited performances of its cast, Blockers wins its audience over one sex-filled, gross out gag after another."
m/blonde_ambition," It's easy to hog pile on Jessica Simpson, and certainly ""Blonde Ambition"" makes a great case to grab a flaming torch and run her out of the acting world for the rest of time. Perhaps if Simpson acted like an adult for once it would be a different story."
m/blood_2012," An effective British police thriller, Blood benefits from some stylish location work in Northeast England's The Wirral and a typically engrossing performance from Paul Bettany."
m/blood_and_black_lace, The dummies here reflect a society's ruthless commoditization of the body and flesh.
m/blood_and_chocolate," If the bad title isn't enough to scare you off, there's little else in this lame werewolf romance that might do the job."
m/blood_and_money," It is so content to occupy the safe middle ground without ever doing anything of interest such as exploring its characters or its location, that it feels like an heartless exercise in mimicking better films just for the sake of it."
m/blood_and_wine," It's a morality play, really, but dripping with humid sex and violence."
m/blood_brother," An affecting, unusual and intensely personal film, although it works more effectively on an emotional level than a fact-disseminating one."
m/blood_brother_2018," ""Blood Brother"" is just a compendium of pulp clichés, with nothing to say about these characters or the worlds they inhabit."
m/blood_diamond," Zwick may as well have titled his newest action-adventure The Constant Gardener II: Diamonds Are Forever, as it peddles the same distasteful, condescending attitudes toward Africa as did Fernando Meirelles' 2005 fiasco."
m/blood_done_sign_my_name," This is a damn good TV movie, but it's Black History Month, so it may do a little business."
m/blood_father, A serviceable piece of B-movie entertainment without an ounce of originality. But audiences that respond to films like these are unlikely to think that's a dealbreaker.
m/blood_fest," Constantly pointing out what happens in horror movies is not clever. Characters repeatedly saying ""This is usually when something bad happens!"" is not funny. And having your heroes recognize that they're in a horror movie is not a novel idea."
m/blood_glacier," Though essentially a familiar monster movie / survival horror story, Blood Glacier is so well put together that it feels fresh and punches well above its weight."
m/blood_honey," What wins the audience over here are the performances, the beautiful images, and the family drama which feels real."
m/blood_into_wine," Enjoyment of Blood Into Wine will likely be determined by one's passion for winemaking, or for Keenan himself."
m/blood_of_heroes, There's little to look at and nothing worth hearing. Even the game itself is a drag.
m/blood_on_her_name," Blood on Her Name is tight, tense, and buoyed by a phenomenal lead performance. Such solid filmmaking is a rare delicacy nowadays."
m/blood_on_the_mountain," The film may be one-sided, but if nothing else, it is a reminder that the ""coal equals jobs"" equation is a serious oversimplification."
m/blood_punch," Mostly crass, witless snark, and the fresh-faced, hollow actors don't have the scuzzy charm or fatalistic comic rhythms needed to make this material disreputably fun."
m/blood_quantum," The film's a bit plodding and all over the place at times, but when it's good, it's great - emotionally affecting, fun and gory as hell."
m/blood_ransom, While the portentous glances and oblique dialogue of the undead evoke stylish '70s Euro-vampires - as do the trippy cuts and fade-outs - Oliver's manhunt feels more like a low-budget '80s potboiler.
m/blood_simple," A good filmmaker can make grim material watchable, but it takes a great one (or two) to make it fun."
m/blood_tea_and_red_string, An original head trip definitely not recommended for kiddies.
m/blood_ties_2013," Blood Ties is a curious film where if you were to remove any of the crucial parts, it would splinter, yet put all together, it kind of works, in its own wildly uneven way."
m/blood_vessel," BLOOD VESSEL boasts impressive practical effects, set design, and a strong cast, but is stunted by familiar vampire mythos and the limitations of its ship setting."
m/blood_work, Eastwood returns to the crime beat one more time with rudimentary potboiler material.
m/bloodline_2019," It counts too heavily on the shock value of familiar ideas the script doesn't lift above contrivance, and which his direction treats with a deadpan restraint that doesn't fully pay off."
m/bloodrayne," Less pleasurable than the throbbing bladder pain begat by too much movie theater soda, BloodRayne ably continues Uwe Boll's indisputable reign as the worst filmmaker on the planet."
m/bloodshot_2020," The action makes Bloodshot exciting, but LaMorne Morris almost single-handedly makes it fun."
m/bloodsport," Classic Van Damme. Fighting, fighting and more fighting."
m/bloodsucking_bastards," While it's not offensively violent, it's full of sexist jokes. And while many viewers will be able to relate to jabs at bottom-feeding companies, they'll probably wonder how such a lackluster script ever became a movie."
m/bloodworth_2010," Decently sketched in its surrounding detail, but don't expect any dramatic catharsis; the track upon which Bloodworth travels is all too familiar, even if runs through a neighborhood less often glimpsed."
m/bloody_marie, ...a shot of adrenaline in a landscape filled with cinematic clones.
m/bloody_nose_empty_pockets," Blurs the boundary between documentary and feature filmmaking, making for a playful, compelling sui generis work."
m/bloody_sunday, An exceptionally accomplished historical recreation.
m/blossoms_in_the_dust, So intent on packing as many events as possible into a relatively slim 100 minutes that it can't devote enough time to developing any of them.
m/blow," A mature, emotionally resounding film that could have easily been released in December and garnered several Oscar nominations."
m/blow_out," Brian De Palma's movies are a stunningly uneven lot, but that might just be because he takes as many risks as he does."
m/blow_up_1966, The energy of the first hour dissipates just as the mystery is supposed to be deepening. But I envy you if you're seeing it for the first time -- it's still the finest motion picture to ever conclude with mimes pretending to play tennis.
m/blue-sky, The final film by the great Brit director Tony Richardson.
m/blue-water-white-death," A fine sense of adventure and suspense, super underwater photography and a great deal of unnaturally ""natural"" chit-chat topside, between the dedicated divers."
m/blue_caprice_2013," Blue Caprice premiered at Sundance as part of the NEXT category and rightfully so because it most assuredly marks the beginning in what we hope will be a bright career for both Alexander Moors, and Tequan Williams."
m/blue_car, [Blue Car contains] a fantastic (and most likely star-making) performance by Agnes Bruckner and a script that never strikes a false or phony note.
m/blue_chips," It is a very homogenized movie that never offends, yet never seems to be for real either."
m/blue_crush," While Bosworth may be pretty and look good in a bikini, having someone who could actually surf would have brought an authenticity to the film that it badly lacks"
m/blue_gardenia, Lang's edgy direction and long tracking shots emphasize the characters' sense of entrapment in circumstances and drives the action towards its compelling conclusion.
m/blue_hawaii, It's the kind of film you would probably only watch if on a long-distance airplane flight.
m/blue_iguana_2018, Hajaig and his actors understand how juxtaposition can be endearing.
m/blue_in_the_face, It feels less like a movie than a lost episode of the old Steve Allen or Jack Paar late-night chat shows.
m/blue_is_the_warmest_color," Abdellatif Kechiche reveals through his sense of composition, and collaboration with his remarkable actresses, a sensitivity to emotional nuance that's striking."
m/blue_jasmine," A meaty, fully realized drama that cleverly functions as both an update of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and a satire on One Percent excess."
m/blue_jay," Though the film largely trains on the simple, dialogue-fueled interaction of two people, it feels more spectacular than theatrical, showcasing the acting prowess of two master performers feeding on mutual chemistry and performative bravado."
m/blue_lagoon, You can focus on the gorgeous locales or the underage skin. Or you could just watch a much better movie.
m/blue_like_jazz," Blue Like Jazz charts a typical existential coming-of-age tale, yet remains atypical by being hip while also treating religion fairly."
m/blue_night," ""I'm not done yet,"" Vivienne declares. But we never even see her get started."
m/blue_note_records_beyond_the_notes, Masterfully directed by Sophie Huber and perfectly edited by Russell Greene with evocative photos and footage that bring back memories of the pioneers of jazz.
m/blue_ruin," A taut, atmospheric and darkly comic revenge thriller."
m/blue_story, Rapman [Andrew Onwubolu] offers no solutions to these terrifying real-world problems. He's got a message but he doesn't preach it. His film is unsentimental and powerfully authentic
m/blue_streak, The blatant disregard for reality might have been excusable if any of the execution was actually funny.
m/blue_valentine, This is an extremely painful film with undeniably powerful performances from both Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.
m/blue_velvet, Not quite like any other thriller or erotic mystery you've ever seen.
m/blues_brothers," The Blues Brothers is packed with lively music, fantastic chase sequences and nonstop slapstick comedy."
m/blues_brothers_2000, The film celebrates the blues with style and affection.
m/blumhouses_truth_or_dare," Despite not actually being scary and sometimes howlingly dumb, Truth or Dare is idiotic, intermittently smart, hilarious fun, and could easily become the next big franchise for Blumhouse"
m/blur_no_distance_left_to_run," Neither a weak cash-in nor a by-numbers talking-heads fest, the film boasts exceptional live footage."
m/blush1996-hong-fen," Its use of color was startling, as yellow was most effectively used to both evoke a sense of renunciation and hope."
m/bmx_bandits, ... Trenchard-Smith directs the BMX action with high energy and gets a lot of personality and camaraderie from the teen actors.
m/boarding_gate, Chock full of elements that never spark beyond one-sheet dimension.
m/boarding_school_2018," Boarding School is not without its flaws, but its meanings and representations dive deeper than the typical thrillers that have come before it."
m/boat_trip, This movie must be pretty bad if even a Swedish tanning team can't earn it a good review.
m/bob_and_carol_and_ted_and_alice," The genius of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice is that it understands the peculiar nature of the moral crisis for Americans in this age group, and understands that the way to consider it is in a comedy."
m/bob_funk," If you can get through the tedious first half of Bob Funk, there's actually a decent little character study waiting on the other side."
m/bob_lazar_area_51_and_flying_saucers," Corbell's desire to ""weaponize"" his audience is undercut by his indifference toward trying to convince anyone watching who wasn't a true believer already."
m/bob_le_flambeur, Definitely worth checking out on the big screen in a fresh print.
m/bobby-g-cant-swim," The kind of movie that comes along only occasionally, one so unconventional, gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away."
m/bobby_deerfield," Pacino is at his best: precise, internal, magnetically cute, and expert at capturing the fear in this man's turtle-like existence and his longing for change."
m/bobby_fischer_against_the_world, The fascinating and turbulent life of chess master Bobby Fischer is impressively documented in Liz Garbus's gripping film.
m/bobby_jones_stroke_of_genius," While it's somewhat bloated and intermittently dull at two hours-+, the polished visual treatment and Caviezel's sober performance lift this above the standard network movie-of-the-week level that might otherwise have been its natural domain."
m/boccaccio_70," It has glamour, sophistication, color, wit and sensuality (not necessarily in that order), all of which blend very well in the enveloping air of a facility that is to be devoted to the showing of sophisticated films."
m/bodied," Pummeling, overlong, and at times a bit too proud of its own provocations, ""Bodied"" is nonetheless a feverishly entertaining spectacle ..."
m/body_at_brighton_rock," While there are some lulls to the story where the film feels like it spins its wheels a bit, Body at Brighton Rock is still an admirable effort from [Roxanne] Benjamin, who crafts an intriguing cinematic rumination on the effects of isolation and fear."
m/body_cam," It's spinning a story that is fairly simple, but in an incredibly tense way. The suspense here is so thick that you can cut it with a knife. I gotta say, Mary J. Blige has created a whole new acting career for herself that is just awesome."
m/body_double," Body Double is an exhilarating exercise in pure filmmaking, a thriller in the Hitchcock tradition in which there's no particular point except that the hero is flawed, weak, and in terrible danger -- and we identify with him completely."
m/body_of_evidence," I've seen comedies with fewer laughs than Body of Evidence, and this is a movie that isn't even trying to be funny."
m/body_of_war," A powerful argument against impetuous decisions, be they to join the military or to attack a country."
m/body_snatchers," Instead of really being scary, the film made me think of something that has troubled me since: don't movie characters watch movies?"
m/bodyguards-and-assassins," The thematic weight of Bodyguards and Assassins comes down to the duality between varying belief systems, and how codes of honor and villainy can be associated with both sides of the battlefield."
m/bohemian_rhapsody," If, indeed, the intent of this bio-pic is to chronicle the events that led to Queen and Freddie Mercury's legendary performance at Live Aid, well, I guess the goal has been met. The movie, as it is, is fine. But it could have been so much more."
m/bokeh_2017," Strives to be meditative, examining art, life, and the pain of living, but it never achieve its full dramatic wingspan, wasting its potential on actors incapable of keeping their characters compelling."
m/bol_bachchan_2012," Director Shetty delivers another successful comedy after box office hits like Golmaal, All The Best and Singham."
m/bolero_1984, The director is no Vadim and the star is no Bardot.
m/bolt, It's got a great ensemble cast. It's not the most original idea but still effective nonetheless.
m/bomb_city," The film's message, which it wields like a war chain, is a timeless one: Don't be such a dick to people because they look different from you. We all live in Bomb City: One stray match and the whole thing will explode."
m/bomb_it," Bomb It offers a new way of looking at the world's cities, courtesy of the art world's fleeting phantoms, who often have to choose between buying food or a can of spray paint."
m/bombay_beach_2011, The film neither buries nor praises its subjects. It's too busy using them as props.
m/bombshell_2019," Despite the killer cast performances, BOMBSHELL left me feeling meh and unsure of who this flick is actually for."
m/bombshell_the_hedy_lamarr_story," Bombshell becomes not just a stupendous tribute to Lamarr, but also a tribute to every brilliant woman ignored."
m/bonded_by_blood_2010," Decently made and well-acted, but with a whiff of glossy, high-life voyeurism."
m/bone_collector," The movie's atmosphere is moody and intense, bubbling like a caldron. Unfortunately, the broth turns out to be stone soup."
m/bone_tomahawk, A gleefully grisly genre gazpacho that matches a rousing sense of Old West derring-do to a comic sensibility as dark as chewing tobacco - and at least as much of an acquired taste.
m/bones," If grossness gives you the giggles, at least a couple of the movie's effects indeed put a little 'wow' in this cinematic bowwow."
m/bones_brigade_an_autobiography," Skate culture remains in solid hands with filmmaker Stacy Peralta, who fashions his most personal doc on the sport-cum-lifestyle."
m/bonfire_of_the_vanities," It's confused, confusing and pretty darn bad. But the cast prevents it from ever becoming boring."
m/bonhoeffer, The film is far more successful when raising questions of spirituality and Christianity than when dealing with the subject at hand.
m/bonjour_tristesse," While some may be put off by Preminger's glossy presentation of the idle rich, his direction in Bonjour Tristesse engages the mind while it stimulates the senses."
m/bonneville, A tragic waste of time and talent in every sense of the word.
m/bonnie_and_clyde, An enjoyable late-sixties era romp that was the first to really challenge the conventions of filmmaking.
m/bonsai_2011," Cristin Jimnez likes quirkiness and his enthusiasm for it, evidenced in his first film Optical Illusions and again here, goes a good way to convincing you to take the ride."
m/boogeyman, An incoherent grab-bag of disconnected shock effects--stylishly mounted but ultimately empty and pointless.
m/boogie_man_the_lee_atwater_story," A fascinating, warts-and-all documentary about one of the most notorious and influential figures in 20th Century politics."
m/boogie_nights," Boogie Nights isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's a provocative and involving character study, as well."
m/boogie_woogie," Director Duncan Ward tries way too hard to nail a way too easy target in his sub-Altman ensemble spoof of the overpriced, overhyped, overly pretentious modern-art scene."
m/book_club," It's light entertainment meant to be shared, a big glass of summer fun that goes down easy."
m/book_of_monsters," transforms its coming of age tropes into an icky Eighties-style gorefest, conjuring the spirit of Evil Dead II with its own comic diabolism, its practical effects, its Necronomicon-like book of the title, and its hidden toolshed"
m/book_of_shadows_blair_witch_2," The unknown actors do a fine job of looking freaked out at all times, but the compassion felt for the original Blair Witch victims isn't translated to these new adventurers."
m/bookers_place_a_mississippi_story," Rediscovered historical footage plants the seed for a moving, beautifully crafted Civil Rights doc."
m/booksmart," Exhibiting a raucous sense of humor that has no qualms with shifting gears from the gross-out to the surreal, Wilde hints we've only seen a fraction of her talent."
m/bookwars, Sheds some light on a demimonde of sorts at the edges of Greenwich Village
m/boondock_saints, Duffy has made a film that sort of straddles the fine line between great movie and useless piece of garbage.
m/boondock_saints_ii_all_saints_day, The true abiding love affair here remains between Duffy and QT.
m/boost, Whenever he Is on screen Woods turns a B-movie melodrama about human waste Into a humming psycho-drama.
m/bootmen," The movie has been adapted by director Dein Perry from his own performance piece, which he might have been better advised to make into a concert film."
m/booty_call, This is the raunchiest sex comedy I can remember... Did I laugh? Sure. Did I recount some of the more incredible episodes to friends? You bet. Is the movie any good? Does goodness have anything to do with it?
m/borat," Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius, and his new film is a comedic masterpiece."
m/border_2018," [It] builds out such an unusual premise that it risks devolving into quirky inanity, but Abbasi grounds the narrative in an emotional foundation even as it flies off the rails."
m/border_incident," a film of stylistic virtuosity saddled with a humdrum scenario, yet graced with a few subversive surprises."
m/borg_vs_mcenroe, It's too bad Borg/McEnroe didn't have a little more fun along the way.
m/borgman," How do you solve a problem like Borgman? A puzzle movie from the Netherlands with seemingly no key, it frustrates and intrigues in equal measure. Well, maybe not equal measure. Much more of the first thing."
m/boricuas_bond, The film suggests that moon 'n' maul is the standard sexual approach of Latino men to any and every woman.
m/born_free," Although the movie is a family favorite, the DVD treatment is rather shoddy."
m/born_in_flames," Made piecemeal over a number of years and first released in 1983, this 90-minute comic fantasy has lost little of its radical edge."
m/born_into_brothels," Some of the children's photographs are lovely, and the film has a thick, humid vibrancy to its colors."
m/born_on_the_fourth_of_july," This is an impassioned movie, made with conviction and evangelical verve. It's also hysterical and overbearing and alienating."
m/born_romantic," Except for Jimmy ... these are not very interesting folks and, at first, it's hard to keep them all straight or even care."
m/born_to_be_blue, Ethan Hawke gives one of the best performances of his career in Robert Budreau's Chet Baker non-biopic.
m/born_to_be_wild_2011," Parents should be prepared to dish out some of life's tougher realities on the drive home, when the ""Daddy, what's a poacher?"" questions will invariably arise."
m/born_to_dance_2015, Born to Dance is worth the ticket price for exactly that - the dancing.
m/born_to_fly, The doc feels more padded than the floor mats Streb's gravity-defying dancers bounce off.
m/born_to_win," Despite some funny and some touching moments, everything rings hollow."
m/boston, A smartly produced and remarkably well-researched history of the Boston Marathon...
m/bostonians," ''The Bostonians,'' which opens today at Cinema I, unfolds elegantly but not always smoothly... But the performances, especially that of the astonishing Miss Redgrave, generate an urgency and momentum to match Mr. James's own."
m/bottle_rocket, Bottle Rocket is full of the kind of energy and style that more movies should aspire to attain.
m/bottle_shock," The only thing that differentiates this 'movie' from an infomercial is its unbearable feature length. If you have to sit through it, bring plenty to drink."
m/bottom_of_the_9th_2019," The director's sense of place counts for a lot here, and a sympathetic lead performance will have most who catch the film rooting for this underdog."
m/boulevard_2014, A celebration of little words that can make a big difference.
m/bounce, Dramatic contrivances and manipulation stain a tissue-thin plot.
m/bound," A clever and funny script, strong performances, and very accomplished and intelligent direction."
m/bound_to_vengeance," José Manuel Cravioto's wants so badly to work the femsploitation angle, but has no functional understanding of the crucial factors that distinguish between the good and bad apples."
m/bounty_killer_2013," Flat jokes, uneven performances, and a predictable romance help make ""Bounty Killer"" a lot less fun than it should be - a killer shame, given its boldly gonzo premise."
m/bourne_identity," In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn't suck."
m/bourne_supremacy, Most of Supremacy is an overedited headache that hardly makes up in frayed nerves what the visuals lack in clarity.
m/bourne_ultimatum," Finally a movie for adults: Easily the most intelligent, mature, and exciting Hollywood picture this summer, boasting a shining turn from Matt Damon as the coolest (anti) hero around."
m/bowfinger, A satire with enough wisdom to recognize there's still something delightful about being a film-maker.
m/bowling_for_columbine, Moore is a master pot stirrer. He is a drama queen sans make-up like no other. And he is one funny mofo.
m/box_of_moonlight," The film is meant to be a whimsical romp, and it takes some time to getting used to eccentric actor John Turturro as Everyman in Middle America!"
m/boxcar_bertha," Although a Martin Scorsese retrospective could easily survive its absence, Boxcar Bertha is a cornerstone of the director's filmography"
m/boy_2012," Outwardly simple, yet inwardly complex, this soulful coming of age debut feature from Taika Waititi is the tale of a young boy's harsh reality deflected by fantasy"
m/boy_a," For all its sensitivity, thoughtful sobriety, and sound performances, though, Boy A finally permits itself an excessive number of contrived and/or clichd gestures."
m/boy_and_his_dog, Bizarre late-70's sci-fi weirdness. With Don Johnson!
m/boy_and_the_world," Tension between the city and the country has been a fertile topic for as long as there've been cities, and Alê Abreu's phantasmagoric The Boy and the World explores the eternal conflict in a familiar yet wholly original way."
m/boy_culture," It sentimentalises and moralises at times, but the characters remain nicely complicated right to the end."
m/boy_erased, This film has the power to open minds as well as hearts. What Conley went through is utterly heartbreaking and is something that no person should ever have to go through.
m/boy_friend, One of the filmmaker's most captivating and stylish works -- and the only one of his films to ever receive a G rating.
m/boy_in_the_striped_pajamas," Despite the 12A certificate, I would regard this as most suitable for intelligent children aged ten to 12, who will be more prepared than adults to ignore its major implausibility - that security at concentration camps was ever this inefficient."
m/boy_meets_girl_2014," Under the guise of a conventional romantic comedy, this independent feature explores gender politics and sex-positive themes with depth and passion."
m/boy_named_charlie_brown, The appeal of Schultz's pop philosophy hasn't faded in forty years: this kind of sincerity can't be faked.
m/boy_who_could_fly," It's a film to please the formalists, though I'm not sure about anyone else..."
m/boyhood," It seems appropriate that Boyhood was always in the background, charting its filmmaker's growth from Tape to Before Midnight. As Mason grew, so did the man who kept returning to his story."
m/boynton_beach_club, Enjoyable evidence that life goes on just fine after the death of loved ones.
m/boys_and_girls," It avoids cheap laughs and respects its young characters, and that's a welcome change."
m/boys_dont_cry," The problem is that all of the characters are essentially repugnant for one reason or another, so it's difficult to relate to any of them."
m/boys_of_abu_ghraib," ""Boys of Abu Ghraib"" has a few, brief insights into how boredom, anger, and frustration helped fuel the rage that led to torture but the film couches it all in the filmmaking of TV-movie melodrama, draining it of all potential power or social context."
m/boys_on_the_side, The entire film feels like the result of a market study.
m/boys_the_sherman_brothers_story," Engaging docu draws on plentiful archival footage and A-list interviewees, and should lure dedicated nostalgists."
m/boys_town, Shameless but effective weepie about wayward orphans
m/boyz_n_the_hood," Boyz N the Hood is a rude, insistent rap, an unflinching, often funny, always compassionate look at coming of age in South Central Los Angeles."
m/bra_boys, An odd and suspect mix of documentary and public relations.
m/brads_status, Brad's Status is a simple yet brilliant film that is one of the biggest surprises of the year.
m/brahms_the_boy_ii," Even a legitimate descent into satanic madness at the end can't save this one, and my audience rejected it like a bad kidney, laughing and mocking the final scenes. A"
m/braid_2019," Suspense, let alone psychological nuance or narrative development, all take a back seat to what feels like an empty, mannered series of dress-up photo opportunities."
m/brain_damage," A weird, oddball 80s horror film for anyone who liked and enjoyed the horror and humor of Basket case"
m/brain_dead," Heck, I could sit through a movie a whole lot worse than this one just to see a pair of my favorite actors banter back and forth."
m/brain_on_fire," It's the sort of role for which the Razzies were invented, and what little audience it finds will almost certainly be heckling as they watch Moretz implode."
m/brake," Dorff's mannered Bruce Willis affect seems as insincere as the script, which helplessly loses credibility as info accrues and the narrative unpeels."
m/bran-nue-day," The script does, however, profit from the love affair that springs up between Andrew Lesnie's cameras and the blue and ochre of the northern Australian landscape. And the show's basic attractions remain."
m/branded_2012," Branded"" is a confusing sci-fi thriller that takes itself much too seriously."
m/branded_to_kill," Seijun Suzuki doesn't do establishing shots, and when he does, they don't establish s***."
m/bratz_the_movie," The dialogue is stupid, the plot is stupid, and unfortunately, the stars are as brainless as their plastic counterparts. This is girl power?"
m/brave_2012," Amiable, action-packed without being overbearing about it, and marked by a new level of visual complexity, even by Pixar standards, Brave peddles a pleasant but somewhat conventional tale with assurance and panache."
m/brave_new_jersey_2017," The film's narrative simplicity can be charming or frustrating, depending on your feelings about awkward dialogue and overreacting actors."
m/brave_one," In exploring what fear has done to Erica, Jodie Foster gives one of the best performances of her career."
m/braven," Engaging at times, giving Momoa a chance to play a normal guy for a change, but the picture is caught between two tonal extremes, lacking a master plan to mix drama and woodsy mayhem."
m/bravetown," First-time director Daniel Duran, working from a screenplay by Oscar Torres that abounds in the maudlin and risible, isn't able to lift the ham-handed material to a place where it might ring true."
m/brawl_in_cell_block_99," It's a richly drawn crime and punishment fable, a noirish b-movie with real fondness for its cinematic forerunners, an extravagantly gory exploitation flick and a blistering showcase for the Vaughnaissance."
m/breach," As he proved in Shattered Glass, Ray has a talent for nailing the essence of an ecosystem."
m/bread_and_tulips, Completely by-the-book in its light feel-good ways.
m/break_point," ""Break Point"" has its difficulties with storytelling and tone, but it carries most of the way, finding a rich sense of humor on and off the court."
m/break_up," The Break-Up is being marketed as an 'unconventional romantic comedy,' but the only thing unconventional about it is that it's not romantic and it's not a comedy."
m/breaker_morant, Breaker Morant is a top-notch film about an injustice in the annals of military history.
m/breakfast_at_tiffanys," It's with good reason that 40 years after appearing as Holly Golightly, Audrey Hepburn ... is still a poster icon for those aspiring to the kind of classy romance that doesn't seem to exist anymore."
m/breakfast_club," decent Brat Pack movie, but not the best. Anthony Michael Hall is hilarious as usual. Chicks cannot hold de smoke . . . dat's what it is."
m/breakfast_with_scot," The kind of gay-themed pic that won't ruffle the feathers of a granny in Manitoba, though it's bound to make more discerning auds groan."
m/breakheart_pass, The pity is that the level of achievement is so simplistic that boredom sets in rather quickly.
m/breakin_all_the_rules, A cleverly concocted hybrid of conventional romantic comedy and mistaken-identity farce.
m/breaking_a_monster," Not many DIY preteen bands can inspire a massive YouTube following, but the trio of young African-American musicians comprising Brooklyn-based heavy metal group Unlocking the Truth is exceptional in many respects."
m/breaking_and_entering, What gives the movie its intrigue and vitality though is the neighborhood where the story takes place.
m/breaking_and_exiting," Very little happens in the way of narrative or character development, which leaves the film over-reliant on a central chemistry that isn't really there."
m/breaking_away," Breaking Away is not only about friendship and competition, it is also a touching tale of youthful initiation into adulthood."
m/breaking_in_2018," For those seeking a few mindless thrills, unlike the bandits, you've come to the right place."
m/breaking_news, Inventive action film from Hong Kong looks at how modern media and electronic communications changes everything in the old game of cops and robbers.
m/breaking_the_girls," This ""Shadow of a Doubt"" riff is a bisexual Hitchcock teaser."
m/breaking_the_waves, Will introduce the experimental director to a wider American audience.
m/breaking_upwards," What stings throughout this stutter-stop relationship are the spot-on modern details, but the overall hipness is a little too forced -- it's damn funny when it could've been poignant."
m/breakthrough_2019, Breakthrough is an emotionally moving film that faith-based families and individuals are really going to enjoy. Secular audiences may find it to be cheesy.
m/breath_of_the_gods_2014," It lacks narrative momentum but not warm humour or extreme headstands: you won't need telling twice that certain moves are ""definitely not for beginners""."
m/breathe_2017, Keeps its eyes moist and its upper lip stiff to the last - but its sweeping inspirational gestures rarely reach all the way to the heart.
m/breathe_in," This delicate, melancholy love story steps right for much of its first two-thirds, but even when melodramatic contrivances break the spell near the finale, strong work from Guy Pearce and Like Crazy alum Felicity Jones draws us in at every moment."
m/breathless," It's as innovative as it is entertaining. It's clever, hilarious, amazing... You just can't miss this!"
m/breezy," A bit of low-key captivation, specifically Californian yet curiously Gallic"
m/brian_banks," Hodge's performance is what keeps the film on track. He is powerful in scenes of anger, but he may be even better in purely silent moments where his unspoken reactions are eloquent."
m/brick," Writer/Director Rian Johnson goes back to the old days when characters were rocks, dialogue was king and the plot demanded you pay attention to every last bit."
m/brick_lane," Quietly effective, acted with resource and directed with the kind of patient skill it needs."
m/brick_mansions," The final result is passable enough to justify a rental for action lovers, but for everyone else Brick Mansions deserves a pass."
m/bride," A rare return to Bride of Frankenstein territory, The Bride isn't helped by the obvious comparison to its much-better predecessor"
m/bride_and_prejudice, Chadha's attempt to mix East and West just doesn't work.
m/bride_flight," As in Twin Sisters, a veneer of nostalgia, + excellent lensing and acting, make the soap-opera plot play on the bigscreen."
m/bride_of_chucky," Bride Of Chucky, the fourth film in the Child's Play series, plays like an unfunny and corny parody of the first three films."
m/bride_of_frankenstein," A classic, much better than the relatively straightforward original."
m/bride_of_re_animator," If it lacks the intimate cohesion of the first film despite its desire to resurrect a feeling of doomed love, it at least isn't coy about ladling out the goodies."
m/bride_of_the_gorilla," A rubberplantation yarn, badly in need of extensive patching and vulcanizing."
m/bride_of_the_monster, More fun than its ridiculous story and brutal acting and incompetently designed sets would indicate.
m/bride_of_the_wind," The woman who was muse, mother, and a musician in her own right remains no more than a striking beauty with a couple of drop-dead dresses."
m/bride_wars," After last year's ""27 Dresses,"" 20th Century Fox has decided to once again make another bridal-themed movie aimed at female audiences who are in the mood to see a movie but have no apparent desire to see a good one."
m/bridegroom_2013, [A] simply told but exceptionally moving documentary.
m/brides_of_dracula, One of the better horror films put out by the schlock Hammer studio.
m/brideshead_revisited, There's room for more than one Brideshead in this far less glamorous day and age.
m/bridesmaids_2011, The big problem with the premise is that jealousy is not funny... the film follows the same plot as all 'outrageous wedding' movies.
m/bridge_of_spies," Hanks has never seemed more like a modern Jimmy Stewart, drink in hand, just looking to get home to his bed, as the script leans into its cavalcade of slightly bizarre negotiations with Eastern European goons."
m/bridge_on_the_river_kwai, Most war movies are either for or against their wars. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) is one of the few that focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals.
m/bridge_to_terabithia," Oh, devastating, devastating and lovely and bittersweet and entirely wonderful, this enchantingly old-fashioned movie..."
m/bridge_too_far," Massive, shapeless, often unexpectedly moving, confusing, sad, vivid and very, very long."
m/bridges_of_madison_county," As director, Eastwood has decided to go for cinematic poetry, and occasionally he manages to achieve just that."
m/bridget_jones_diary, The story spins artfully up to the climax where it bumps like a firefighter hitting buttocks to floor
m/bridget_jones_the_edge_of_reason," The delightful first picture celebrated Bridget's imperfections. This smug, slapped-together sequel mocks them for cheap laughs."
m/bridget_joness_baby_2016," A warm, witty and welcome return - intelligently evolved and an absolute hoot. As Bridget would say: 'v.good'."
m/brief_history_of_time," A capable documentary, but the title's misleading. It's more about Hawking himself than the book this docu takes its name from."
m/brief_interviews_with_hideous_men," An uneven, intriguing adaptation of David Foster Wallace's book of short stories, the film and its bits-and-pieces structure ultimately don't add up to as much as hoped."
m/brigadoon," Magical Scottish village, singing, dancing, and romance."
m/bright," Bills itself as part buddy-cop movie, part lavish fantasy, does neither justice, resulting in lazy nonsense that's too silly to be good and too self-serious to be any fun."
m/bright_eyes, ...my tolerance for Shirley Temple's brand of sugary lightheartedness is rather limited.... But it would be churlish of me to deny the little moppet's winning charisma.
m/bright_leaves," Bright Leaves is a smart, ethically rich, innovative and well-done documentary about the tobacco industry. family legacies and the pleasures of filmmaking."
m/bright_lights_starring_carrie_fisher_and_debbie_reynolds," This touching love story - with each other, the past, and the camera - has clear appeal, to 'Old Hollywood' fans, to Star Wars followers, to voyeurs in general."
m/bright_star, Breaking through any period piece mustiness with piercing insight into the emotions and behavior of her characters.
m/bright_young_things," The result will be judged on two levels: as an adaptation of Waugh's classic novel and as a film on its own merits. Possibly torn between the two, Fry fails at both."
m/brightburn, The film succeeds because it offers what it promises without excessive expectations. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/brightest_star," This is a movie that so privileges the perspective of the good-looking foofy-haired white male that it makes you understand the absolutely pejorative aspect of the term ""heteronormative."""
m/brighton_beach_memoirs," Poignant portrayal of puberty has sexual content, profanity."
m/brighton_rock-2010," Rowan Joffe is an extremely talented artist and one of the jewels in the crown of British cinema at present, but this film is pointless and uninspiring, and far from his best work."
m/brigsby_bear_2017," Director Dave McCary, an SNL writer and segment director, zeroes in on the offbeat wavelength of Mooney and Costello's script, which may be the most bizarrely funny thing to come out of Sundance since Napoleon Dynamite."
m/brilliant_lies," Director Richard Franklin and playwright David Williamson combined their considerable creative forces for Brilliant Lies - a tight, steamy, wordy drama/thriller"
m/brimstone_2017," Brimstone is hampered somewhat by its ponderous, doom-laden pace, and resultant bloated running time, but remains an intriguing slant on the spaghetti western ..."
m/bring_it_on, Some of the wittiest dialogue to trip an adolescent tongue since Clueless.
m/bring_it_on_all_or_nothing," Someone over at Universal figured that ""cheerleaders = money,"" and that's basically how sequels get made these days."
m/bring_me_the_head_of_the_machine_gun_woman," The video game-inspired visuals, pulsing synth score and manic level of energy make it quite the ride indeed."
m/bringing_down_the_house, Bringing Down the House offers proof that there are times when superior performances can salvage a mediocre script.
m/bringing_out_the_dead, It's got some moments of power and valiantly fights off cliches and narrative formulas.
m/bringing_up_baby," Comedian Harold Lloyd called this the most perfectly constructed comedy he'd ever seen, and he was right."
m/bringing_up_bobby_2012, Ms. Jovovich displays such a keen awareness of her strengths that she brings out magical elements I never believed possible.
m/britt_marie_was_here," Nearly every element in Britt-Marie Was Here feels familiar, down to the subplot of the evil rich person wanting to close down a youth center... but... the elements work."
m/broadcast_news," The film is so ingratiatingly high-spirited, and the performances so full of sass and vigor, that in the long run it doesn't really matter much."
m/broadway_danny_rose, A modest but often side-splitting effort from the neurotic comic.
m/broadway_idiot_2013," For theater geeks, a key interest will be getting rare access to witness how a complex production comes together."
m/broadway_melody, Mainly a curiosity for film buffs who want to see how musicals erupted in the early days of the talkie.
m/broadway_the_golden_age," If you love the theater, you've got to see the film and simply enjoy as everyone from A (Edie Adams) to Z (Karen Ziemba) holds forth."
m/brokeback_mountain," The fine details of the West are as precise as you would expect from a McMurtry piece, and Lee's adroitness with the excellent cast is on full display, particularly in the brave and moving performances of Ledger and Gyllenhaal."
m/brokedown_palace, about as thrilling as a long line at customs. The screenplay (is)apparently based on those recorded warnings played in airports... Danes and Beckinsale struggle to bring some conviction to a story sorely in need of it.
m/broken_2012," Too often looks strained, desperately self-conscious and replete with unconvincing and unearned emotional crises."
m/broken_city," A scattered drama that can't be bothered to play by its own rules making for an uneven, inconsistent viewing experience."
m/broken_embraces," Feels like a mixed bag of smart ideas and nods to other pictures, rather than a coherent, distinct work of art."
m/broken_english, It is that rare romantic comedy in which women can actually see themselves.
m/broken_flowers," A Jarmuschian bouquet of episodic structure, desultory road-tripping, and droll dislocation, each comic setup as simple and plywood-dry a contraption as ever."
m/broken_hearts_club, Light but consistently entertaining ensemble comedy. Dean Cain is a riot.
m/broken_horses," This wan crime drama plays like the equivalent of a Hindi novel that's been run through Google Translate. Everything feels rudimentary and slightly awkward, though it's possible to discern how the material might once have been powerful."
m/broken_lance," It's a gripping, framed familial saga of intergenerational misunderstandings, racial hang-ups, and eventually even a court-room drama."
m/broken_tower," The Broken Tower feels unique as a young man's tribute to an adventuresome, doomed soul."
m/bronco_billy," This movie clearly means a whole lot to Clint Eastwood, and he does a darn good job of showing why."
m/bronson," Dark, intelligent and disturbing, supported by a force-of-nature lead performance and a clever screenplay."
m/bronx_tale," A wonderful, touching tale about growing up and making decisions."
m/brood, A definitive metaphor for the coldness and cruelty of acrimonious divorce.
m/brooklyn," An earnest, wholesome and stirring drama, Brooklyn has all the makings of an indie-film darling."
m/brooklyn_castle_2012," This engaging, entertaining film might just spur you to become involved in some way in making sure that important and productive public school programs survive the recession and further budget cuts."
m/brooklyn_lobster," Kevin Jordan's small family drama, set in Sheepshead Bay, is an unusually pure example of American kitchen-sink realism."
m/brooklyn_rules," If Winter had an extraordinary youth, it eludes Brooklyn Rules, another generic memory piece in which the now-successful writer takes us on a thinly veiled tour of the burger joints, bowling alleys and faces from his formative grunge years."
m/brooklyns_finest," Tough and sorrowful...A dirty little beauty, a cop tale in which nobody wins and the best one can hope for is a draw. Except for the audience, that is."
m/brother_2010, Good football action and an inside look at the Caracas barrios cannot save this film from a thin script and sport drama predictability.
m/brother_bear, The embarrassing Earth Mother chants by Phil Collins further remove us from the world of the sacred past and straight into a Disney marketeer's cubicle.
m/brother_bear_2," While not nearly as memorable as its predecessor, Brother Bear 2 has plenty going for it."
m/brother_nature," Killam, who recently departed SNL after six seasons, shows a great grasp of his character's escalating bewilderment and frustration."
m/brother_sun_sister_moon," It is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Just about any frame of the film, blown up, could make a beautiful poster for the film."
m/brother_to_brother, Has the quiet urgency of a story that must be told.
m/brotherhood_2010," Despite a running time of less than 70 minutes (- the credits), still outstays its welcome."
m/brothers_2004, The deficiencies of Brothers lie in its wholesale adoption of war film clichés and obvious plotting.
m/brothers_at_war," Just because Rademacher believes his film to be ""non-partisan"" does not make it so."
m/brothers_bloom," As a pair of brothers raised to be topnotch grifters, Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo are seldom allowed to play off of each other amid the film's breathless busyness and adoration for eccentricity."
m/brothers_grimm," Gilliam has rarely been more inventive, energetic, or just plain funny."
m/brothers_hypnotic_2013, We see Phil's sons honoring him while going their own ways in a years-long effort to find the right pitch.
m/brothers_justice," Has considerable heart, pluck and amiable, ambling chemistry, but no well-defined angle driving it, so all the satirical underpinnings feel flat and undercooked, unattached to a more grounded reality."
m/brothers_karamazov," When the acting's good, it's very good, but when it's bad, it's laughable and director Brooks' attempts at injecting Slavic intensity misfire badly sometimes."
m/brothers_of_the_head, Ever wonder how much more fun/disastrous Oasis would have been if Noel and Liam were attached at the chest? This is your chance to find out how that would play out.
m/brothers_solomon," Solomon is episodic and desperate, leaving nothing to get excited about, with the possible exception of the end credits. I was pretty happy to see those sweet babies arrive."
m/brown_sugar," I like this movie a lot. It's probably the sweetest, corniest movie about hip-hop music you're ever going to see."
m/brubaker," I never felt that I was wasting my time watching 'Brubaker,' only that it could have been a more dramatic and taut prison movie-which is odd, because it's directed by Stuart Rosenberg ('Cool Hand Luke')."
m/bruce_almighty," Carrey forces it early on, stiff, awkward. But becomes comfortable once he gets those God Powers. He's funny, but it's Steve Carell who garnishes the film's belly laughs."
m/bruno," This is our cultural conversation right now, and Bruno minces in, ready to demolish preconceptions in every direction."
m/bruoguminn, ...it's almost impossible work up any enthusiasm for the foibles of the various characters thanks to an emphasis on eye-rolling instances of quirkiness and melodrama.
m/brute_force," Bristling, biting dialog by Richard Brooks paints broad cameos as each character takes shape under existing prison life."
m/bubba_ho_tep," If you are in the cult of Bruce Campbell, go see it. If not, you may not get what all the hubbub is about. It is Bruce's finest work."
m/bubble_boy," Rarely funny, mildly entertaining in a morbid sort of way, and almost always terrible."
m/buck," First feature for Cindy Meehl is confidently assembled, with attractive contributions from the two cinematographers and composer David Robbins."
m/bucket_list, Those expecting acting fireworks or any pleasure from the first teaming of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman will be disappointed by Reiner's schmaltzy messagy serio-comedy about living life to the fullest.
m/bucket_of_blood, It's a low budget masterwork that skewers the fad of its era while lambasting the ever-fickle art world.
m/bucky_larson_born_to_be_a_star," With his pageboy haircut, ''Gee, golly'' Midwestern accent, and two protruding Chiclets for front teeth, Bucky Larson is a one-note joke played over and over and over."
m/buddy_holly_story," Starring newcomer Gary Busey in the title role, the film is already being touted as the sleeper of the year and deservedly so."
m/buddymoon, Flula's shtick is not universally palatable and Buddymoon does sink or swim depending on your enjoyment of it.
m/budrus," Following events over several years, director Julia Bacha uses visual sources and interviewees (including Israeli soldiers) to sculpt a timely testimony to the power of peaceful resistance."
m/buena_vista_social_club_adios," Both an exemplary sequel and a vital, informative companion piece."
m/buffalo_66," Vincent Gallo's ego gets the better of his storytelling in his acting-directing-writing debut, but there are flashes of genuis that make it worth watching."
m/buffalo_bill_and_the_indians_or_sitting_bulls_history_lesson," It's a sometimes self-indulgent, confused, ambitious movie that is often very funny and always fascinating."
m/buffalo_boys_2019," Buffalo Boys is not without its clumsiness.... But the talent behind it is obvious, from its Indonesian and Singaporean producers down to the character players fighting for women's rights while riding water buffaloes and firing shotguns."
m/buffalo_girls_2012, Todd Kellstein doesn't allow you to entirely indulge convenient (though understandable and perhaps irresistible) armchair outrage.
m/buffalo_soldiers," This jaunty mish-M*A*S*H has a seductive, nonchalant glitter and an unshakably mocking attitude."
m/buffy_the_vampire_slayer, Flat comedy/horror flick that barely scratches the level of mediocrity in either genre.
m/bug," Though the characters in it might not actually have bugs under their skin, Friedkin's creepy film will certainly get under yours, for good or ill."
m/bugs_2006, That hulking gorilla in King Kong and those rampaging dinosaurs in Jurassic Park have nothing on the amazing monsters in Bugs! in 3-D.
m/bugs_life," It's hard to consider that anything could break new ground off of ""Toy Story"", but in this case, an exception is made."
m/bugsy," In seeing the distracting, destructive nature of vanity, the film fascinates itself, and the audience, with a simply stated, terribly complex question: why can't we look away?"
m/bugsy_malone," Bugsy Malone is like nothing else. It's an original, a charming one, and it has yet another special performance by Jodie Foster, who at thirteen was already getting the roles that grown-up actresses complained weren't being written for women anymore."
m/bukowski_born_into_this, Bukowski is one of my all time favorite writers and now I have an all new respect for the man thanks to John Dullaghan's phenomenal film.
m/bull_2020," Compared to Zhao's ethereal achievement, ""Bull"" is more of an understated footnote that applies the same tropes to the framework of a less sophisticated narrative. It's an engrossing entry all the same..."
m/bull_durham," Bull Durham, the new baseball movie starring Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon, eases up on you, lazy as a cloud, and carries you off in a mood of exquisite delight."
m/bullet_2013," Such mediocrity extends right up until the final moments, with a hugely anticlimactic finale."
m/bullet_head," A film that somehow manages to be fairly watchable, yet nonetheless really needed intervention from the conceptual stage onward."
m/bullet_to_the_head, Unashamedly a brain-ejecting excuse to watch Sylvester Stallone shoot people in the face.
m/bulletproof_monk, Adults will likely object to the innumerable plot question marks coming off the screen like so many kung-fu kicks to the head.
m/bullitt," One of the cinema's very best car-chase sequences -- set amid the hilly, windy San Francisco streets -- caps this quintessential Steve McQueen policier."
m/bully," Clark pulls no punches and never panders to the Moral Majority; he simply makes his point, over and over again: This is what your children think is acceptable behavior."
m/bully_2012," Leaves us moved by poignant scenes of victims' shattered lives, but, for reasons unclear, keeps the bullies themselves largely out of our reach."
m/bulworth," Sharp, sometimes intelligent and always stimulating..."
m/bumblebee," It's a movie more Iron Giant than Armageddon, though unlike the Vin Diesel-voiced Brad Bird creation, no Autobot will be able to insist they're ""not a gun"" forever"
m/bunny_and_the_bull," King has the same kind of olde worlde, amateur-hour aesthetic as Wes Anderson and Michel Gondry, and his papier mâché/metalwork figures and landscapes are used to increasingly charming effect."
m/bunny_lake_is_missing," Olivier is excellent as the analytical inspector, his easy-going grace a delightful contrast to the two stars."
m/bunraku," It's a pic that's akin to a terrarium of plastic flowers -- gaudily decorative, but airless and lifeless."
m/bunty_and_babli," A considerable improvement over his trivial debut, Saathiya, Shaad Ali Sahgal's vibrant, rollicking and often absurd film is first-rate mindless entertainment."
m/burden_2017," At first, no one would ever connect this placid, agreeable work with the madman who did Shoot, but it's a testament to Marrinan and Dewey that this film gets us there."
m/burden_2020," Burden is a good story, but told from the wrong perspective."
m/burden_of_dreams," At best ""Burden of Dreams"" offers a superficial, inconclusive impression of an esoteric project whose distribution is bound to be haphazard."
m/buried, A brilliantly twisted suspense thriller that would have made Alfred Hitchcock proud.
m/burke_and_hare," The humour may be too broad in places -- corpse-based slapstick pales with repetition -- but, for the most part, 'Burke and Hare' is well-timed and often funny."
m/burlesque," Yeah, girlfriend can out-sing just about anyone in the biz, even Mariah Carey these days, but that's about all that Burlesque is interested in showcasing."
m/burma-vj," Ostergaard has woven stunning footage with invasive reenactments that confusingly blur the line between what's real and what's recreated, undermining the vivid, first-hand accounts that should be the film's spine."
m/burn, A fascinating museum piece from an era in which art and radical politics often mixed to vital result.
m/burn_2012, Vividly captures a year in the life of eastside Detroit's Engine Company 50.
m/burn_2019," There's a lot of confidence to ""Burn,"" and a smart casting find in lead Tilda Cobham-Hervey, who carries the picture with exceptional commitment."
m/burn_after_reading, The reason this film gets a slightly above average grade is the strength of Brad Pitt's silliness and the momentum the movie has near the end.
m/burn_country_2016, Ian Olds's film is essentially a standard backwoods noir tale given a topical twist.
m/burn_witch_burn," It's like a full-length episode of Boris Karloff's Thriller TV series, very stylishly done."
m/burn_your_maps," The set-up is quirky and charming, but director Roberts has problems with tone"
m/burning-palms, Evinces enough hatred of mankind to make Todd Solondz look like a dedicated humanist.
m/burning_2018," The result is a strict realistic and prosaic narrative's disquieting tale, but whose inner nature is allowed to infect the abyss of the fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/burning_annie," For all the shallowly witty banter, Max and company are even less interesting than Annie and Alvy."
m/burning_blue, Top guns in love struggle against institutional homophobia in a tone deaf melodrama well past its sell-by date.
m/burning_dog," Trey Batchelor's directorial debut tmixes a wide array of genres such as action, comedy, buddy cop movies, criminal heist and double crossing scenarios with their matching tropes, resulting in quite a particular and unorthodox blend on screen."
m/burning_man, A film that will shock you with its honesty and its bravery. I can't wait to see it again.
m/burning_plain," Despite an OK-to-good cast led by Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger, + a handsome tech package, this remains an elaborate writing exercise with few emotional hooks."
m/burning_sands_2017, A workmanlike but unavoidably predictable yarn about the perils of college fraternity hazing.
m/burnt," Cooper is compelling, but [character] Adam makes you want to punch him in the face ... Great chefs may be horrible, arrogant, violent, self-centred, pretentious, egomaniacal dickheads, but that doesn't mean we want to spend an hour and a half with one."
m/burnt_by_the_sun," Though my foreign Oscar pick would still have been Eat Drink Man Woman, Sun is such a personal close second that I can go with the academy novelty of novelties."
m/burnt_offerings, One of those comfortable relics that doesn't scare so much as mildly chill.
m/burton_and_taylor, Burton and Taylor succeeds thanks to its truncated timeline and intimate feel.
m/burts_buzz, Burt's not your typical entrepreneur. He's not your typical anything.
m/burying_the_ex_2015," What we get here is not a reinvention, it's the wholesale reanimation of something that had been buried for a long while. Like the shambling zombie corpse it is, initially we're glad to see it come back to life, but pretty soon it starts to decompose."
m/busco_novio_para_mi_mujer," By the time the movie's third act roles around, the movie runs out of steam and reaches an abrupt end. Sadly, Busco Novio Para Mi Mujer finds no seducer of its own."
m/bushwick_2017, The Purge sequels do this kind of thing with a lot less fuss.
m/business_of_being_born, A wonderful piece of filmmaking and a top viewing priority for those even entertaining the idea of bringing a new life into the world.
m/business_of_strangers," Stettner seems to understand perfectly that all you really need for making a fine movie is a sleek script, alert performers and a damn good eye."
m/busters_mal_heart," Doom and disorientation are omnipresent, but like Jonah/Buster, you'll want-nay, need-to press onward and discover the final revelation."
m/bustin_loose, Richard Pryor in his prime but the movie is mediocre.
m/but_im_a_cheerleader," But I'm a Cheerleader is funny, but it's not only funny."
m/butcher_boy," This potentially disturbing film is handled as a crazy, unstoppable black comedy."
m/butchers_son, Even a breaking glass is filmed in slow motion and accompanied by ominous soundtrack pounding -- unless that thud is the movie hammering the same point home again and again.
m/butt_boy," Butt Boy is a surprisingly effective slow burn that warms the audience up, like a frog in a pot of boiling water, before taking a hard left to full-on bizarro land as the end draws near."
m/butter_2011," Pleasant despite being awfully slight and rather mean-spiritedproof that this material might have made a far better picture with a smarter, more controlled voice."
m/butterfield_8," Though it's generally true that nothing dates faster than Hollywood's idea of what's daring, Butterfield 8 can be viewed as a fascinating artifact from the days when movie stars' offscreen myths were carefully woven into their on-screen roles."
m/butterflies_are_free, Watch this one if you've ever wondered how Goldie Hawn became a star.
m/butterfly_effect," Full of interesting ideas but suffers from an unevenness of tone and from a smothering, unpleasant atmosphere that often makes watching it a chore."
m/butterfly_kiss," There is a world of possible interpretation lurking beneath the surface of Frank Cottrell Boyce's script, which is as disorientating as the scenario the characters find themselves in."
m/bwoy," Mr. Young, who also wrote the script, teases out the story in bits of coy hints and half-truths about a tragic accident, leaving too many questions unanswered."
m/by_the_grace_of_god_2019," This is a social justice film made with purposeful conviction and a quiet, never strident, sense of indignation."
m/by_the_gun," Certain scenes in By the Gun pack a powerful punch, but it doesn't coalesce into a satisfying whole."
m/by_the_sea_2015," In its own way, it is as loving an homage as something like House of the Devil, Super 8, or Hobo With A Shotgun in terms of painstakingly crafting a seemingly original film that mostly lives to remind audiences of a different movie from long ago."
m/byzantium_2012," Finally, a full-blooded and truly original vampire movie, offering an antidote to the Sweet Valley-style sudsiness of the Twilight franchise."
m/c_word_2016," Equally insightful, enraging and poignant. The most powerful, life-altering documentary since Food, Inc."
m/cabaret," Much-lauded, Fosse's look at pre-Nazi Germany is pretty uneven and uninspired -- his work is far better when we're inside the Kit Kat Club where there's singing and dancing to be had."
m/cabin_boy, Strange little comedy that's a lot more intriguing than you might think.
m/cabin_fever_2016," Travis Zariwny predictably scrubs all the edges and eccentricities down, however, fashioning another impersonally polished cover jam."
m/cabin_fever_3_patient_zero," Not a great film and it isn't supposed to be, but Cabin Fever 3: Patient Zero more or less does its job of delivering equal parts laughter and fright."
m/cabin_in_the_sky," The gorgeous dreamlike sets and consummate control of the fantastic atmosphere that imbues the story (an idle, poverty-stricken farmer dreams of being sent to Hell upon dying) are already well developed."
m/cabiria," This stunning silent epic was a huge influence on D.W Griffiths when he came to make Intolerance, and matches that film for scope, vision and spectacle."
m/cable_guy," Those who take Carrey's side will be turned off by his cruel behavior, and those that love to hate him will end up hating the movie's final softshoe. That problem aside, however, the rest of the film is refreshingly funny."
m/cache_2005," The tight pacing of Michael Hudecek and Nadine Muse's editing keeps the story fluid and focused but very concise, commanding audience attention from start to finish."
m/caddyshack," Does it hold together as a quality comedy? No, not really."
m/caddyshack_2," The original was no great shakes, but this is beyond bad."
m/cadence, A fine look at the racial differences of the armed forces of that era.
m/cadillac_records," It's good to see the gifted but underused Darnell Martin (I Like It Like That) working, and her showbiz biopic displays good acting (especially Jeffrey Wright) and music, even if the story and the telling are not always exciting to watch."
m/caesar_must_die_2012," The movie's predominant black-and-white palette pares the action to its starkest outlines, and a few color sequences reconnect the prison, and the prisoners, to the surrounding world."
m/cafe_de_flore," Caf de flore leaves you wrestling with your emotions, not sure of how to react."
m/cafe_society_2016," A polished, amber-coloured sonnet to the Hollywood Golden Age of the 1930s."
m/caffeine," While I realize that the sophomoric angst served up here is some people's cup of java, it's artificially sweetened enough to drive me to herbal tea."
m/caine_mutiny," Top-notch courtroom drama, with Bogie etching another unforgettable character."
m/cairo_time," The setting and star Clarkson were enough to bring me on board, but the real surprise is dashing character actor Siddig, who makes for a seriously sexy leading man."
m/cake_2015," At the last minute, ""Cake"" becomes a film not about chronic pain, but a different subject entirely, and one about which it doesn't have all that much new to say."
m/calendar_girls, Not the one-joke affair you might have expected from the trailer but a warmhearted look at women who are fine with 1950's-type coyness.
m/calibre," Feels simultaneously familiar and fresh, just like a good, solid bout of genre-tweaking should do."
m/california_dreamin," ... part goofy village comedy, part geopolitical allegory, part satire."
m/california_solo," The star is vibrant and touching in every scene, often providing character revelations where none appear in the script."
m/california_split, What Altman comes up with is sometimes almost a documentary feel; at the end of California Split we know something about organized gambling in this country we didn't know before.
m/california_suite, All-star Neil Simon adaptation houses enough laughs to warrant a visit.
m/california_typewriter_2017, The overlong but charming documentary California Typewriter is an ode to the iconic writing instrument.
m/call_me_by_your_name, Love and intimacy between two male characters has never truly felt this real or emotionally heartbreaking.
m/call_me_kuchu_2011," Call Me Kuchu, a documentary about homophobia in Uganda, lifts a rock in that country and discovers the insect life ruling it."
m/call_me_lucky," The kind of documentary that only results from a singular combination of subject and storyteller. Funny, touching, and emotionally raw in the best, ballsiest way."
m/call_northside_777, James Stewart's brusque characterization provides Call Northside 777 with its edge.
m/callas_forever, The result is not only one of Zeffirelli's sumptuous productions but also a film that celebrates the sacredness of artistic integrity that to Zeffirelli Callas embodied fully.
m/calle_54," The moving moments in Calle 54 are isolated, mainly because Trueba's approach, while ensuring a killer soundtrack, is too scattershot to satisfy."
m/calling_all_earthlings, Berman's failure to fully explore his colorful cast would be forgivable if that main narrative were clearer. But Earthlings is rather scattered.
m/calvary_2013," A superbly written, darkly funny and powerfully moving mystery with a terrific supporting cast and a magnificent central performance from Brendan Gleeson."
m/calvin_marshall," A rare and invigorating spotlight on the back to basics collective spirit among salt of the earth workingclass enthusiasts of any game played among them, simply for the love of sports beyond money and fame. And just the way it was always meant to be."
m/cam, There's a good short film here trapped in the body of this feature.
m/cam2cam," If Cam2Cam was a Chatroulette user, you'd pass by this cyber snoozer without hesitation. Next!"
m/cameraman_the_life_and_work_of_jack_cardiff," Watching and listening to Cardiff, it is impossible not to be entranced by his knowledge, his excitement and his enthusiasm."
m/cameraperson, It is a remarkable document about the creative process in the service of a specific goal. It may even tap into a richer vein: what it's like to live on planet Earth.
m/camille_claudel, An ambitious film about an overlooked artist and a self-reliant woman whose story is worth pondering.
m/camille_claudel_1915_2013, A worthy film of such glacial pacing that it unfortunately borders on the soporific.
m/camino_2016, ... jettisons any provocative exploration of its multicultural subject matter and devolves into a mindless ultraviolent bloodbath.
m/camp," Graff ... at least has his heart in the right place, and those expressive, talented kids are the real deal."
m/camp_nowhere, Innocent fun and should appeal to the pre-teen audience.
m/camp_rock," Demi Lovato has all the requirements for Disney stardom, but she doesn't really act so much as walk through this movie, stopping occasionally to flash a larger than life smile."
m/camp_x_ray," If nothing else, it suggests that Kristen Stewart may escape the prison of Twilight"
m/campfire_2004," The half-baked, curiously optimistic ending is frustrating, but otherwise this is a moving, beautifully acted picture."
m/can_we_take_a_joke_2016," Whilst it's impressively produced, it focuses so hard on making its point that it overlooks the nuances that make the subject interesting."
m/can_you_keep_a_secret, Daddario doesn't nearly get the material that can match her abundant energy.
m/canadian_bacon," A funny, underrated little gem that doesn't say much for Michael Moore as a fictional director, but does showcase his talents as a writer. The last decent John Candy film."
m/canary_2018," [A] rich, poignant and finely observed musical-drama."
m/candidate," Much like Network, this satire on an American institution continues to gain relevance instead of lose it."
m/candy," Even as they spiral inevitably downward from ecstasy to hell -- she turns tricks, he steals -- they somehow still look really attractive, which is a ridiculous thing."
m/candy_corn, Candy Corn is a love letter to Halloween and classic slashers of the 70's and 80's that is sure to be a holiday favorite for horror fans.
m/candy_jar," 'Candy' turns out to be the most apropos way to describe Candy Jar. It's reliably sweet and empty, a fine choice for anyone looking for a light option."
m/candyman," I was never a big fan of this film. It has its moments, but it isn't worth sitting through 90 minutes to see them."
m/candyman_farewell_to_the_flesh," If the film had anything more substantial on its mind than fake blood or honey, it might set race relations back a century."
m/cane_river," Cane River offers American indie cinema a hero worth remembering, and a romantic with a vision beyond his years."
m/caniba, [A] frequently uncomfortable but always fascinating work ...
m/cannery_row, Cannery Row falls a long way short of being a great movie -- but it does just fine as a pretty good one.
m/cannes_man," Richard Martini really knows Hollywood - if you're a fan of The Player, you'll love this. You'll see more stars in this than you will outside the window of a space ship!"
m/cannibal_2014," A meticulous lead performance by Antonio de la Torre is the one saving grace of this dumb, arty horror movie from Spain."
m/cannibal_ferox, The most shocking thing about Cannibal Ferox is that it remains a somewhat popular entry in the largely worthless Italian cannibal genre.
m/cannibal_holocaust," Whether or not it was his intention, it is also possible to discern a message amid the cruelty: read this as a savage indictment of the power of the media in general, and exploitative documentary filmmaking in particular."
m/cannibal_the_musical," It's all pretty stupid, but at times, there are refreshingly ludicrous notes that even people old enough to see this movie without a guardian can appreciate."
m/cannonball_run_2, Cannonball Run II is one of the laziest insults to the intelligence of moviegoers that I can remember. Sheer arrogance made this picture.
m/canopy, Canopy is writer/director Aaron Wilson's first-person take on the sensory experience of being lost at war.
m/cant_buy_me_love," As written by Michael Swerdlick and guided by Rash, the theme dissolves into a bland parody of pubescent pain."
m/cant_hardly_wait," There's nothing new here, and no great moral insights."
m/cant_stand_losing_you, Of interest to Police fans but hardly a rock-doc for the ages.
m/cant_stop_the_music," Pretty poor, but the enjoyable level of kitsch places it above the other musical turkeys of the era, all of which are far more painful to endure (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Xanadu, The Apple)."
m/cant_stop_wont_stop_a_bad_boy_story, The fact that the filmmakers didn't really have much to work with beyond archival and current documentary footage makes their accomplishment all the more impressive.
m/cant_think_straight," Homophobia in Muslim families and communities is a topic ripe for exploration, but as its eye-rollingly lame titular pun makes clear, I Can't Think Straight isn't the film to do it."
m/cantinflas," To the uninitiated, such as myself, apart from the familiar landmarks of a career's trajectory, a lot of what is going on is too lightly sketched."
m/capernaum," While this is unquestionably an issue film, it tackles its subject with intelligence and heart."
m/capital_2013," Costa-Gavras is on message, but off his game in this rambling, occasionally tone-deaf high finance drama."
m/capital_in_the_twenty_first_century," Pinketty's argument, that the feudalism and exploitation that Marx was decrying 150 years ago has returned, is worth hearing out in this lively, information-packed and damning documentary."
m/capitalism_a_love_story," This is a typical Moore oeuvre: funny, often over the top and of dubious documentation, but with strongly made points that leave viewers much to ponder and debate after they walk out of the theater."
m/capone_2020, Josh Trank does a tremendous job in crafting an effective tale with great filmmaking attributes. The direction is consistently proficient and cinematography is positively superb.
m/capricorn_one," Pretty soon the project gets bogged down in innumerable difficulties, not helped by the awfulness of most of the dialogue."
m/captain_abu_raed, 'Captain Abu Raed' could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship between new filmmaker Amin Matalqa and discerning moviegoers everywhere.
m/captain_america_1990," Salinger has some good moments dealing with the cultural shock of his Rip Van Winkle reawakening, but film never takes flight under Albert Pyun's leaden direction."
m/captain_america_civil_war, Civil War isn't great despite being the third Captain America and thirteenth overall Marvel movie - it's great because of those things.
m/captain_america_the_first_avenger," A fun origin story in the Spider-Man model. It's got the heart of an underdog really experiencing the wonder of his new powers. I'm not saying it's as good as Sam Raimi's film, but I'll take a solid copy of that over the likes of Thor."
m/captain_america_the_winter_soldier_2014," You can't help but feel disappointment that a film with a relatively spicy premise becomes, in the end, so risk-averse."
m/captain_corellis_mandolin," An acceptable translation of written material into visual material, but it's not much more."
m/captain_fantastic, The movie's an amusing and useful cautionary table. I hope they teach it on college campuses.
m/captain_horatio_hornblower," ...holds its own against Russell Crowe's CGI expeditions from topsail to yardarm, and this one has more plot."
m/captain_january," A feel-good hokum musical-comedy cashing in on the popularity of cinema's wonder-child, Miss Curly Top, Shirley Temple."
m/captain_kidd, Sails the high seas on Charles Laughton's sea legs.
m/captain_marvel," It's meant to show the lighter, more family-friendly side of the MCU, and to that extent, younger viewers should be pleased. But there are no lump-in-your throat moments in ""Captain Marvel."""
m/captain_phillips, Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks team up for a pulsating account of the kidnapping of the captain of an American cargo ship by Somali pirates.
m/captain_ron, Kurt Russell is the only thing that makes this movie tolerable - and just barely at that.
m/captain_underpants_the_first_epic_movie," When you get beyond the toilet humor (fart jokes, nods to Uranus) there's a lovely story of true-blue friendship."
m/captive_2015," What matters is two people who think they have lost everything and how just one of them chooses life, hope, and purpose."
m/captive_state," Captive State is imperfectly constructed, at times frustratingly so, but it's trying, doggedly, to do something different and given the bland efficiency of so many wide-releasing sci-fi movies, that's hard to fault."
m/captivity," It flunks because it's one of the daftest, dullest films I've seen in an absolute age."
m/capture_the_flag_2016," For some Capture the Flag will just about scrape by on its honourable intentions and brisk delivery; however, what seems on paper like a vaguely educational distraction, is merely another exercise in colourful chaos."
m/capturing_the_friedmans," An oddly riveting chronicle of one family's devastating demise and, less successfully, an attempt to shed light on the validity of pedophile witch-hunts."
m/car_wash, Norman Whitfield's great musical score is integrated into the movement of the scenes to give the film a funky rhythm.
m/caramel, Caramel is as sweet as its name suggests and it marks Nadine Labaki out as a definite talent to watch.
m/carbon_nation, Will the grandchildren of our grandchildren cherish our memory because we rose as one and did the right thing?
m/cardinal, he end is a great letdown from what Mr. Preminger might have accomplished with the 1950 novel of Henry Morton Robinson. There is no strong flow of spirit through it. Even the melodrama is perfunctory and weak.
m/care_bears_movie, This endearing movie's mottoes are: never stop caring. And: the best way to make friends is to be a friend yourself.
m/career_opportunities, Career Opportunities plays like a hodgepodge of Hughes' greatest hits.
m/careful, There's something wonderfully unique about the project but the reasons for doing it remain buried.
m/careful_what_you_wish_for, It's easy to get lost in the bloody-mindedness of it all.
m/cargo_2018," In Cargo, love knows no bounds, and that's a pretty powerful message no matter how you spin it."
m/carlitos_way, A competent and solidly unsurprising urban-underworld thriller: De Palma's imitation of a middle-drawer Sidney Lumet movie.
m/carlitos_way_rise_to_power, ...a legitimate piece of work (and not just a sleazy attempt to milk the popularity of the original).
m/carlos_2010," Ambitious, persuasive account of ""Carlos"" Snchez, whose use of terrorism changed the world, with a breakthrough performance by Edgar Ramrez."
m/carmen_and_lola, This energetic first feature from Arantxa Echevarria combines a vibrantly realised sense of place and Spain's gypsy community with assured work with a cast of non-professional actors.
m/carmen_jones," While the embarrassment of talent onscreen is a joy to watch, I can't help be overwhelmed and a little saddened thinking how much of that talent went ignored by Hollywood most of the time."
m/carnage," It's well-acted and giddily enjoyable, if slightly less so once the characters start to analyse their descent into barbarism."
m/carnage_park," To enhance the grindhouse vibe, the color scheme mimics that of a fading film print that has ""gone pink,"" which presumes a staying power that ""Carnage Park"" is unlikely to have."
m/carnal_knowledge," Carnal Knowledge's central performances are all strong, but Nicholson and Garfunkel are worthy of special note."
m/carol," An exquisitely drawn, deeply felt love story that teases out every shadow and nuance of its characters' inner lives with supreme intelligence, breathtaking poise and filmmaking craft of the most sophisticated yet accessible order."
m/carol_channing_larger_than_life, Dori Berinstein's tender but sharp portrait finds a lot of depths in the woman whom many see as a camp figure.
m/carpetbaggers," The one bit of life in the film, the wife (Elizabeth Ashley) is played with a Broadway flippancy that spares us the feeling that something good may be getting hurt."
m/carpool_1996," Loud, silly and choc-a-block with madcap slapstick, Hiller's film may have an alarming plot premise but it's innocent enough for all but the youngest kids to enjoy."
m/carrie," As for Carrie virgins, they get both an entertaining and socially relevant take on the King classic."
m/carrie_1952, Well-crafted but dry and sentimental adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's controversial novel Sister Carrie.
m/carrie_pilby," And while Carrie's comic misadventures in trying to have some fun aren't as comical as they could be, we don't mind tagging along as the smartest girl in town learns something new."
m/carrington, We feel a tingle of anticipation that this picture is going to be handled intelligently. And it is.
m/carry_on_camping," While sticking to its well tried, profitable formula, latest Carry on suffers somewhat in comparison to some of its predecessors in that it lacks a storyline, however slim."
m/cars," What ultimately redeems Cars from turning out a total lemon is its soul. Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame."
m/cars_2, Lightning and Mater mix it up with Formula 1 and spies in yet another Pixar winner.
m/cars_3," It's not a great movie but Cars 3 gets the franchise off the scrap heap and has its moments, like a pleasant, diverting drive that leaves you back right where you started."
m/cartel_land," ""Cartel Land"" offers up no easy answers or clear calls to action, but just a first-person account of these situations that rule the news and the hand of policy-makers, providing a deeply humanizing element to this incredibly difficult situation."
m/cas_and_dylan, The story ends up being one wrong turn after another. A GPS hasn't been invented that could get this plot-hole-riddled script back on track.
m/casa_de_los_babys, A comical & penetrating look at a diverse group of American women who want to adopt South American bebes.
m/casa_de_mi_padre, It makes sense that this Spanish-lingo farce plays very much like an SNL sketch. The only problem is that it packs about as many laughs into its 85 minutes as a good skit does in eight or 10.
m/casanova_variations, An unclassifiable and at times fascinating approach to the figure of the famous Giacomo Cassanova. [Full review in Spanish]
m/case_39," A deftly made horror thriller with plenty of scares, Case 39 may be predictable and somewhat heavy handed, but it ticks all the boxes for the genre."
m/caseys_shadow, Walter Matthau bites into his juicy role like a cowpoke chewing on some tobacco and it comes out just right.
m/cash," Although visually striking, Cash gives value for money on stunts but will leave you short-changed on story."
m/cashback," note to next short-turn-feature film director: please, please, pretty please, don't stretch the hell out of your beautiful short when you don't have enough stuff to make it to full length, no matter how pretty you can make it look"
m/casino-jack, ...a sporadically compelling yet lamentably uneven endeavor...
m/casino_jack_and_the_united_state_of_money, Gibney is as good as it gets at making complicated political material come alive on screen.
m/casino_royale, A Bond reboot that explores the fascinating early career of 007.
m/casper," By all standards of logic and reason, this film should be crap... and yet somehow, it succeeds in its modest goals."
m/cassadaga," ...cribs equally from ""Ghost Whisperer""-like spiritual melodrama, ghostly mystery, and grisly torture porn."
m/cassandras_dream," Strong performances, especially from the never-better Farrell. This might be the first time I've watched him and not been completely distracted by that big black caterpillar above his eyes."
m/cast_away," Zemeckis pulls off his best directorial effort yet, and that's quite a statement considering the films he already has under his belt."
m/casting_about," There's no insight here, only voyeurism, and one blisteringly fine German performer reading from [director] Hershey's appalling script."
m/casting_by," The movie business is becoming more corporate and less personal... Recognizing and appreciating the work of casting directors may be one way to stem that tide, however briefly."
m/castle_in_the_ground," An earnest, sometimes skillful effort that nonetheless often feels slack and underwritten, as well as ultimately less-than-rewarding."
m/castle_in_the_sky_1989, Try to picture Terry Gilliam doing an animated Star Wars by way of Jules Verne.
m/castle_keep, Apparent efforts to insert a fresh side of war by concentrating on some of its grim humor act more as a deterrent than a booster to interest.
m/casual_sex," Casual Sex?, the movie, is exactly like the real thing -- kinda empty, kinda unfulfilling, and you feel just awful afterward."
m/casualties_of_war," An underrated film with perhaps the greatest performance that Michael J. Fox ever gave. DePalma looks at Vietnam through a different persepective than an audience is used to, making this far from your typical war movie. Penn, as always, is riveting to wat"
m/cat_ballou, Mainly remembered for Marvin's Oscar-winning comedic performance
m/cat_in_the_hat, The Addams Family-Beetlejuice-Monkey Bone loving lot of you should RUN to this spectacular outrageously brave kaleidoscopic colorburst of a mindtripilous film. Not for kids...
m/cat_run," Made for today it just is more chaotic, has more nudity, and had more violence including some slightly nauseating scenes of torture. Otherwise the film is funny and fun, a fast, entertaining ride."
m/catch_22," Quite simply, the best American film I've seen this year."
m/catch_a_fire, Impending history and potent music energize this Apartheid-era suspense film.
m/catch_and_release," If it was Brad Pitt carrying the coffee and Halle Berry saying she's not serious about him to a buddy, this movie would make over $100 million."
m/catch_hell, Catch Hell suffers from both a drowsy start and a dragging ending.
m/catch_me_if_you_can," The most memorable element of this not-that-memorable film, however, is not Hanks or Walken, or any of the other irreproachable component parts. It is the roguish lead actor, Leonardo DiCaprio."
m/catch_that_kid," Not witty enough to be a comedy and not well-plotted enough to be taken seriously, with flat performances and lackluster direction, it's a serious yawner"
m/catching_feelings," Viewers looking for a weighty, topical film about a man grappling with racial tension-and a turbulent marriage-will enjoy Catching Feelings."
m/catching_out," Ultimately, the film is as numbingly boring as, well, a lengthy train ride during which there's nothing to do but look out the window."
m/caterina_in_the_big_city," [Teghil's] sensitive work goes a long way toward overcoming the unfocused script, which, despite its incisive characterizations, never quite settles into a cohesive tone."
m/caterpillar, Legendary Japanese softcore auteur Kji Wakamatsu channels Samuel Fuller for a twisted domestic-drama-cum-psychosexual-evisceration of Japan's fascist past.
m/catfight_2017," It has a certain outlandish purity of purpose which Heche and Oh follow through on with demonic intensity, making for a film that's just as hard to embrace as it is to dismiss."
m/catfish," This is a film of warmth, humor, suspense and surprising grace, a crowd-pleaser for fans of personal docs, as well as anyone fascinated by the social and psychological ramifications of our increasingly virtual world, ensuring healthy box office numbers."
m/cats_2019," It's a confusing mess, but one that holds a strange fascination."
m/cats_and_dogs," Kids, I suspect, will love the movie and most adults will find it moderately entertaining."
m/cats_and_dogs_the_revenge_of_kitty_galore, None of the satirical touches are ever allowed to impede the pic's madcap pace from one raucous setpiece to the next.
m/cats_dont_dance," For you fuddy duddies out there who think cartoons are for kids, I don't know when the last time you saw a cartoon was, but movie cartoons have never been for kids."
m/cats_eye," Even though the mix contains lumps, Cat's Eye is the best screen adaptation of any King work since Brian De Palma's Carrie."
m/cats_meow, A better-than-competent period evocation that allows the director to flaunt his knowledge (and perhaps vent some of his own bitterness) regarding Hollywood.
m/catwalk_tales_from_the_cat_show_circuit," Catwalk isn't exactly meant to be too informative, but the result is less a charming bit of fluff than another example of filmmaker condescension."
m/catwoman, So bad that I actually recommend you see it. It's the movie you and your friends will rip on all summer long.
m/caught_inside_2010, Caught in the web of its own making and delivers what is strictly formulaic cinema
m/cautiva," The debut feature of Gastn Biraben, Cautiva is most potent in its first hour, as it bears witness to the disorientation and distrust experienced by a young girl whose life is suddenly turned upside down."
m/cavalcade, A creaky tearjerker filled with shrill messages about patriotism and anti-war feelings...
m/cave," it isn't just tedious, it isn't just silly, no, it goes the distance until it actually becomes a personal affront to the sensibilities of everyone concerned"
m/cave_of_forgotten_dreams, Werner Herzog's 3D film brings the newest technology to the world's oldest artwork.
m/cave_of_the_yellow_dog, The friction between her real-life protagonist clan's traditional customs and the outlying modern world remains the backbone of Davaa's ethnographic cinema.
m/caveman," Dismiss Caveman as low-minded stupidity if you like, but I may be giggling too loudly to hear your complaints."
m/cavemen_2013," A 21st Century update of the Little Rascals' He-Man Woman Hater's Club episode where Alfalfa wises up and woos Darla, his Neanderthal pals' protestations notwithstanding."
m/cb4, A fast-paced and frequently hilarious spoof of the old-school rap world.
m/cbgb," [VIDEO ESSAY] If you're a punk fan then you're - at best - on the dark side of your '40s. Nonetheless, you will be drawn to see ""CBGB"" for yourself regardless of how disappointed you will be."
m/cecil_b_demented," Those of us who crave some relief from multiplex conformity and studio imperialism can laugh at some of the jibes in this silly film, but we know that Waters is not an alternative, just an ancillary attraction."
m/cedar_rapids_2010," Ed Helms seeks post-Hangover glory as a meek Midwest insurance peddler out of his depth, but John C. Reilly steals this patchy wild-weekend farce as Mr. Bad Example."
m/celeste_and_jesse_forever," Celeste & Jesse Forever earns points for bucking formula, but its fusion of snark and sincerity has a calculated slickness that rings increasingly hollow."
m/celine_through_the_eyes_of_the_world, Less a conventional concert pic than a hagiographic homemovie.
m/cell_2016," Eli Roth was once slated to direct, and would have been better."
m/cellmates_2012, The real fun here comes from Stacy Keach as a warden who tries (and fails) to instill a mania for potato farming on his highly skeptical prisoners.
m/cellular," A fun film, Cellular is a comedic thriller with good energy and good laughs."
m/celluloid_closet, The filmmakers have gathered together a staggering array of the moving images that the book could only show in still form or verbal description.
m/cemetery_junction," A major disappointment, but not an entirely surprising one."
m/center_of_the_world," We in the audience don't lose interest, not if we have normal libidos at any rate and not if we have the capacity to care about two people who could ... be any of us!"
m/center_stage, Nicholas Hytner's movie might be subtitled Beverly Hills 90210 Goes to Juilliard.
m/centigrade_2020, Convincingly claustrophobic but overextended...an exercise in confined cinema more interesting in theory than in realization.
m/central-do-brasil-central-station," Takes viewers on an insightful tour of modern, working-class Brazil."
m/central_intelligence," Even if the material's not always up to the title's ironic reference to wit, the cast and their director carry the day with a good stock of laughs."
m/centurion," Without any real character development, by the time the closing credits draw in, you won't care less about any of the characters, which for a film with a plot so linear, is a fatal flaw."
m/ceremony_2010," Ceremony is a callow movie: Winkler exhibits no comprehension of the class anxieties he addresses, and extends precocity into adulthood. That callowness is Ceremony's subject scarcely makes it funnier."
m/certain_women_2016," Certain Women is not always thrilling, but it's certainly faithful."
m/certified_copy," Broadly a two-hander, Kiarostami's film touches on love, marriage and art, feeling at times like a dry seminar."
m/cesar_chavez_an_american_hero," [VIDEO ESSAY] The movie reaches its goal of reminding audiences how far migrant workers have come in America since the '60s, and how far they have yet to go toward better working conditions and higher pay."
m/chain_letter_2010," A severely muddled, amateur offering, the film is a complete waste of time. There's almost pride in the manner the feature highlights Taylor as arguably the most inept director of 2010."
m/chained_2012," Jennifer Lynch, daughter of David, does the filmmaking equivalent of drunkenly totalling dad's prized Ferrari."
m/chak_de_india, A patriotic heartwarmer that scores some old-fashioned entertainment goals despite its flaws.
m/chalet_girl, Chalet Girl feels engagingly old-fashioned in the great comedy traditions of the Ealing comedy.
m/chalk, Squirm-inducing but very funny mock documentary shows real empathy for its subjects.
m/chamber," Lacking the surface glitz, attention-grabbing plot and star power of John Grisham's previous adaptations, Folley's film will also suffer due to comparisons with the similarly-themed and better Tim Robbins' Dead Man Walking, released last year."
m/champs," Less about what it takes to win a title belt, Champs examines what it means to be a man in a sport that often views the competitors as animals."
m/chan_is_missing," Director Wayne Wang has a lot to learn about cutting, pacing, composition and telling a story. What saves him, and his movie, is his ability to tell good anecdotes."
m/chances_are, Among the best of the body-switch films that cluttered movie screens in the late 1980s.
m/chandni_chowk_to_china, There simply isn't enough Indian spice to make this ancient Chinese recipe fresh.
m/change_in_the_air_2018," Change in the Air proves frustrating and dull for most of its running time, displaying unwarranted confidence in its ability to cast a spell."
m/changeland," Seth Green pulls off something tricky. He mixes the deadpan yet heartwarming tone of ""Garden State"" with the broken hearted getaway vibe of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."""
m/changeling," For the most part it's imaginative, understated and effectively creepy."
m/changing_lanes," A thought-provoking, sophisticated drama that explores the motivations behind our split second decision-making and the consequences that result."
m/changing_the_game_2012," Suspenseful, intriguing, wise and genuinely heartfelt."
m/chaos_theory," As long as you don't tie your giggle bib on too tight, there's an exquisite depth and unpredictability to Chaos Theory that's wonderful to observe."
m/chaplin, It's easy to pick out the single major flaw of Chaplin. The narrative is too ambitious.
m/chappaquiddick, The push and pull of this movie is really between the lead character and the audience. One moment we feel compassionate: he wants to do the right thing. The next moment he's gone down the cover-up rabbit hole and is an irredeemable swine.
m/chappie," With its stunning urban landscapes, trash-talking titanium hero and mulleted, God-bothering bad guy (Hugh Jackman, never better), this is hugely entertaining."
m/charge_of_the_light_brigade_1936," ...what a grand piece of filmmaking it is, and as a pure adventure yarn, it's hard to beat."
m/chariots_of_fire," Appreciation of this picture doesn't demand a love of sports, merely an understanding of human nature."
m/charley_varrick, Don Siegel's excellent heist/escape movie makes an interesting juxtaposition to his Clint Eastwood films.
m/charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory, Kids may get nightmares from this stuff. You get the feeling that's the way Dahl would have liked it.
m/charlie_bartlett," Cast and crew maintain an engagingly snarky tone throughout the film, with raucous dialog and a gleeful willingness to crush teen movie stereotypes."
m/charlie_brown_thanksgiving," Witnessing the principle in action last night inspired some ready-made nostalgia and some ritualized pleasure. It affirmed the conviction that Charlie Brown is not just a good man, but a beautiful loser."
m/charlie_casanova, In this low-budget Irish tale Charlie Barnham (Emmett Scanlan) is a loathsome psychopath who regards the rest of humanity with sneering contempt.
m/charlie_countryman, This is a movie that looks considerably better than it actually is.
m/charlie_says_2019, What makes Charlie Says so original is its perspective and its willingness to depict the banality and absurdity of life with Manson rather than simply to portray him as the quintessence of evil.
m/charlie_st_cloud, Only marginally suited for a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV episode.
m/charlie_wilsons_war," In Mike Nichols' smart satire of US engagement with the Middle East, history is shown to repeat itself as both tragedy and farce."
m/charlies_angels," I guess I'm just supposed to sit back and enjoy it, but somehow I feel exploited."
m/charlies_angels_2019," Nobody really asked for another Charlie's Angels reboot, but this one will leave you eager for more."
m/charlies_angels_full_throttle, Watching Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is like being trapped inside a pinball machine operated by a 6-year-old having a sugar rush.
m/charlotte_gray, Brock's script deepens the purples of Faulks's prose while airbrushing out the grays.
m/charlotte_rampling_the_look," For a film about one person that reveals so little about the subject, 94 minutes is longer than it sounds."
m/charlottes_web," This highly polished picture is superficially faithful, even reverential to its source, but evinces neither imagination nor a personality of its own."
m/charm_city_2018," It's a powerful movie ... because it raises a myriad of issues, asks a lot of questions, offers some contrasting opinions, and then lets the viewer decide."
m/charulata," A singularly accomplished song to love, idealism, heartbreak and disillusionment."
m/chasing_amy," The premise is unusual, the impact is overwhelming."
m/chasing_coral," The beauty of Chasing Coral is matched only by its urgency, as director Jeff Orlowski encapsulates the issue of global climate change by showing where it's doing real, measurable damage in real time: The world's coral reefs."
m/chasing_ice_2012," Balog has created time-lapse images of the receding glaciers, providing a beautiful but terrifying example of the effects of climate change."
m/chasing_liberty, Chases romance and comedy across Europe for nearly two hours without ever quite catching either.
m/chasing_madoff," Ponzi master Madoff muted whistleblower Harry Makopolis' blasts for decades, as shown in this dark documentary intrigue that filmmaker Jeff Prosserman cloaks in film noir style."
m/chasing_mavericks," ""Chasing Mavericks"" moves as fast as a runner in waist-high water and wears out its welcome."
m/chasing_papi, Watching Telemundo or Univision with the sound off is way more enjoyable than this.
m/chasing_trane_the_john_coltrane_documentary," Director John Scheinfeld's doc is a comprehensive, engrossing and, it's tempting to say, worshipful account of the life of the music titan."
m/chatroom_2010," Based on a play, and adapted by the original playwright, sadly the narrative hasn't translated at all well and the structure feels out of place."
m/chavela, The Mexican music legend and LGBTI icon gets her due in this in-depth documentary.
m/che_part_two, This isn't a biography -- it's a nature show where Guevara is the lion.
m/cheap_detective, You don't have to be familiar with Casablanca or The Maltese Falcon to appreciate the humor but it helps. Writer Neil Simon has thoroughly spoofed both classics.
m/cheap_thrills_2013, Exceptionally entertaining and effective thanks to quality characters and a well-calculated build that justify the gore.
m/cheaper_by_the_dozen, The only thing more outdated than Cheaper by the Dozen's soundtrack is its hokey life lessons concerning the importance of family over career.
m/cheaper_by_the_dozen_1950, There's a lot to be said about a family with 12 kids but this film doesn't do any of them justice.
m/cheaper_by_the_dozen_2," Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is simply a case of plastic characters jumbled together with a contrived script, shoved in a Hollywood comedy oven with the timer bell ignored."
m/checking_out," Only Laura San Giacomo, as Morris's lonely daughter, Flo, transcends the staginess of the premise and the creakiness of Richard Marcus's screenplay to deliver a performance that feels remotely natural."
m/cheerful_weather_for_the_wedding," A welcome addition to the wedding comedy sub genre, light on its feet and brimming with vivid character portraits."
m/cheetah," It's an exceedingly simple story using the lure of golden African locations, animal observation, and teen histrionics to coax viewers in, directed by a guy who used to craft Circle-Vision films for Epcot."
m/cheetah_girls," ...Tom Hanks himself would be hard-pressed to inject life into this cliched, formulaic storyline."
m/chef_2014," Chef's delicious nature has left me starving for more - more of Favreau's beautiful, heartfelt storytelling and free creative reign. A true, gourmet treat."
m/chef_flynn, An undercurrent of familial tension... adds a considerable amount of spice to an already admirably constructed dish.
m/chelsea_on_the_rocks, You want rough-and-tumble? Can you handle rough-and-tumble?
m/chelsea_peretti_one_of_the_greats," Is Peretti indeed one of the greats?... Short answer-yeah, she's pretty friggin' great."
m/chelsea_walls, An intellectually stimulating structural experiment.
m/chely_wright_wish_me_away," The unshakable support of her religious sister, the raw and heartfelt stories of her childhood: These are the moments most likely to provide the inspiration she hopes to share."
m/chennai_express_2013," Jump aboard the Chennai Express for a full-on, SRK-fueled joyride."
m/cheri, It is all beautifully costumed and set --items that should not be taken for granted.
m/cherish," Tweaking genre convention at every turn, Taylor has created a shimmering entertainment that leaves you, well, humming 'Cherish.'"
m/chernobyl_diaries," The result is akin to pretty much any horror flick (or a group version of ""I Am Legend"") where young people enter spooky places and are picked off one by one. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
m/cherry-2010, The film heaps on events and obstacles far too liberally for its skimpy frame.
m/cherry_2000, A tongue-in-cheek sci-fi action pic which owes a considerable debt to the Mad Max movies.
m/cherry_tree," Brendan McCarthy's script is a cliché stack, the heroine's a blank and the villains are paper tigers."
m/cherry_tree_lane, The grim comedy keeps coming and the laughter keeps dying in our throats.
m/cheyenne_autumn," Ford's compositions (he was 69 at the time) are as noble as ever, but a feeling of fatigue hangs over the whole enterprise."
m/chi_raq, The film itself is frustratingly inconsistent and never finds a rhythm to carry it from scene to scene.
m/chicago," If you love the play, or if you've never seen it, this is an outstanding and entertaining adaptation that I would highly recommend seeing in theaters."
m/chicken_little, Another in a new breed of mass-market comedy that substitutes self-reference for original wit and pop songs for emotional content.
m/chicken_people, A delightful documentary about three show chicken breeders whose enthusiasm is wonderful to behold.
m/chicken_run," Many will appreciate the genial, good-natured goofiness."
m/chicken_with_plums, Sit in the front - and don't peer too hard - and Chicken With Plums casts an undeniable spell.
m/chico_and_rita," The great names of both Cuban and American jazz are invoked, and Chico and Rita's tragicomic love story meshes very pleasingly with this musical backdrop."
m/child_44," Despite gritty atmosphere and a sometimes smart script by the estimable Richard Price, whose credits include ""The Wire,"" ""Child 44"" can't sort out the basics."
m/child_of_god_2013," While remaining pretty faithful to the story, Franco somehow manages to inject a note of humour into the story of a man who comes across more as maladroit misfit than evil sociopath."
m/children_of_a_lesser_god," This is romance the way Hollywood used to make it, with both conflict and tenderness, at times capturing the texture of the day-to-day, at times finding the lyrical moments when two lovers find that time stops."
m/children_of_heaven, Children of Heaven serves as a heart warming meditation about real goodness in humanity
m/children_of_huang_shi," Like an eager frequent flyer, Western paternalism changes destinations but not its baggage."
m/children_of_invention," A more than welcome addition, in a film world where mothers more often than not, get a bad rap for everything that ails US society when it comes to shortchanging children."
m/children_of_love," The acting ... is strong, and there are several moments of painful truth -- the wordless weekend hand-overs are well done and difficult to watch."
m/children_of_men," A visually stunning Swiftian satire, Children Of Men may appear clumsy, but its message is simple, heartfelt and ultimately rather moving."
m/children_of_paradise," Even Truffaut conceded in the end: 'I have made 23 films, well, I would swap them all for the chance to have made Les enfants du paradis'."
m/children_of_the_sea_2020," A lonely 14-year-old connects with two boys raised at sea in a gorgeous, sensitive anime movie that takes a wild out-of-this-world turn."
m/children_shouldnt_play_with_dead_things," On any absolute scale of movie ratings, it should score pretty low. However, there is no accounting for the amount of fun one can have with it."
m/children_underground," Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants of the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate."
m/childs_play," For what it is and the era in which it was forged, Child's Play is a solid scary movie."
m/childs_play_2, Entirely standard sequel fare. Fans of the first one will be entertained on an infrequent basis.
m/childs_play_2019," Being an AI with faulty circuitry, Chucky 2.0 doesn't have the hilarious vulgarity or the single-minded murderous glee - the soul, if you will - that made Dourif's Chucky such an unnervingly human abomination."
m/childs_play_3," Running out of steam by this second sequel, but will still please fans"
m/childs_pose," Gheorghiu, a truly great actress, is here playing the part of a woman who is herself a great actress, and we can't catch either out, and the film goes into its end credits having perfectly preserved this ambivalence."
m/chill_factor," With so much time wasted on bad jokes and frivolous plot forwarding, there is not enough bang to raise the temperature of Chill Factor above lukewarm."
m/chimera_strain_2019," Haeems' involuted narrative engineers haunting domestic tragedy from hard science, revealing that the path to immortality is paved with immorality."
m/chimes_at_midnight_1965, The one Welles film that deserves to be called lovely.
m/china_heavyweight_2012, It stands as a fascinating look at a changing China and the courage it takes for those living there to punch above their weight.
m/china_moon, The film's saving grace is in the emotionally impactful performance by Ed Harris.
m/china_seas," A typical MGM star vehicle of the Depression era, benefiting from strong chemistry between Gable and Harlow."
m/china_syndrome," The three stars are splendid, but maybe Miss Fonda is just a bit more than that. Her performance is not that of an actress in a star's role, but that of an actress creating a character that happens to be major within the film."
m/chinatown, Amounts to an amazing achievement of cinematic storytelling.
m/chinese_connection," He [Lee] is decidedly an eye-catching figure as he takes on all comers, singly or in whimpering groups, in stylized, Karate-like bouts with swift, balletic moves, baleful stares, deadly flying fists and legs and, of course, all the necessary eerie shouts."
m/chinese_puzzle_2014," As with the previous films, Klapisch keeps the tone buoyant, livening Xavier's voiceover musings with plenty of visual whimsy."
m/chinese_zodiac, What a pity this workout doesn't deliver a stronger kick.
m/chipmunk_adventure, Chipmunk Adventure is worth one toked-out viewing for Dody Goodman's gratingly senile Miss Miller and her description of the trio's daily breakfast menu.
m/chips, A buddy movie for people that have no friends and don't like laughing.
m/chitty_chitty_bang_bang," It's some fresh circle of hell to revisit childhood favourites only to inevitably discover that, as a child, one is almost indubitably an idiot."
m/chloe_in_the_afternoon, An elegant and moral study of yearning in the life of a married man who's attracted another woman.
m/chocolat," A richly textured comic fable that blends Old World wisdom with a winking, timely commentary on the assumed moral superiority of the political right."
m/choke," The film is hardly a waste of your time and it is an interesting tale to see unfold before you, whether you're reading or watching it."
m/choking_man," If there is finally a point to the film it is that we're all human piatas and that putting sprinkles in your fish soup may not be tasty, but it makes one's upchuck look pretty. I think."
m/chooch," It's an earnest affair that looks like a neighborhood project on film (16-mm, in fact, blown up to 35) for someone's anniversary or birthday party."
m/choose_connor, The ending is also note-perfect. However...it could have used perhaps a bit more restraint in some areas.
m/chopper, There's not nearly enough actual intrigue or suspense to maintain a feature film.
m/chopping_mall, Goofball horror flick is salvaged by a quick pace and diverting sense of humor.
m/chorus_les_choristes, Those of us who prefer our cup of drama without a sweetness filter will be loutish enough to give it a pass.
m/chorus_line," Richard Attenborough's direction achieves that balance of impersonality and brisk pacing we've come to recognize as ""professionalism,"" and he doesn't clog up the dancing with too many stylistic gimmicks."
m/chris-rock-kill-the-messenger-london-new-york-johannesburg, Undeniably funny. But you might find the way that Rock's outfit constantly changes mid-sentence as his act is tacked together from around the globe distracting -- not to mention unnecessary.
m/chris_and_don," Primed as we are by a culture rich in both homophobia and dirty old men, we can be forgiven for anticipating a sordid cautionary tale. It's a shock -- a happy shock -- when Chris & Don recounts a love that approaches the transcendental."
m/chris_rock_bigger_and_blacker," [Chris] Rock seethes with a refreshing blend of irreverence and anger, setting forth on everything from gender and fidelity to taxes and modern medicine."
m/chris_rock_tamborine," Tamborine is rife with political humor and pointed observations on race in Rock's usual style, but the special is mostly about Rock himself, a self-reflective piece in which he owns up to his mistakes."
m/christine," Off the page, a 1958 Plymouth is no more scary than the St Bernard which romped through Cujo."
m/christine_2016," Hall has largely languished with supporting roles in films that in no way prepare you for the breadth she displays in director Antonio Campos's tragic character study, Christine."
m/christmas_eve_2015," If it's trying in some way to promote focusing on What Really Matters this holiday season, it certainly taught me that I'd rather not waste time on vapid homilies."
m/christmas_evil, There are a nice few slasher elements present in Christmas Evil while it also contains great psychological horror. A truly disturbing holiday movie.
m/christmas_inheritance, Nothing the movie shows us about Ellie indicates that this is news to her.
m/christmas_with_the_kranks, The movie waffles between competing ideologies while struggling to find humor in characters who overreact to minutia.
m/christopher_robin," Movies like Christopher Robin don't come around that often any more, and they're good for the soul."
m/chronic," Chronic is a bleak but rewarding drama. Unfortunately, though, it stumbles in the final reel."
m/chronically_metropolitan, Entertaining and original low-key family drama with comic elements.
m/chronicle, Like an addicting YouTube prank video that also intertwines out-of-this-world action with some very real and troubling issues.
m/chronicles_of_narnia_lion_witch_wardrobe," One of the most magical effects… isn't rippling computer-generated fur, ice castles, or battle scenes. It's the wide-eyed wonder and delight on the face of little Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley) as she passes beyond the wardrobe…"
m/chronicles_of_narnia_prince_caspian," lives up to expectations, although it doesn't quite scale the heights set by the original film."
m/chronicles_of_narnia_the_voyage_of_the_dawn_treader," Over the interminable 112 minute running time of Michael Apted's (film), not a single discernable artistic reason emerges as to why 20th Century Fox would have wanted to adopt the third instalment of Disney's jettisoned franchise."
m/chronicles_of_riddick," Eschewing the claustrophobic minimalism of its predecessor Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick is an extravagant orgy of used sci-fi parts."
m/chroniques_sexuelles_dune_famille_daujourdhui, A smutty display of wall-to-wall couplings (and triplings) with a patina of class as thin as a see-through negligee.
m/chrystal," If the as well-performed, better directed star-filled Levity is worth only 50 screens in its widest release, you'd have to think that Chrystal is headed for similar territory."
m/chuck_and_buck," As the film stands, it sheds some light on what happens between young boys, but very little about what happens between men after they have grown up ... whatever that means."
m/chuck_berry_hail_hail_rock_n_roll, Does just what the title says--and with great spunk.
m/chuck_close_a_portrait_in_progress, The result is a portrait that should interest art-savvy viewers and neophytes alike.
m/chumscrubber, A failed satirical circus created by people trying to appear hip to the youth of America.
m/church_ball," Despite the presence of funnyman Fred Willard, stays mostly on the pre-teen comedy level, obscuring an underlying moral about unity and reaching out to the disregarded"
m/churchill_2017, An off-putting hybrid of Great-Man biopic and crisis-of-will psychodrama. It's a movie that wants the patriotic sweep of nostalgic iconography while also pulling back the curtain on a legendary statesman's darkest thoughts.
m/chutney_popcorn," Part portrait of merging cultures, part investigation of the parameters of family loyalty, ""Chutney Popcorn"" is many things, the most important of which is a very good comedy."
m/ciao_2008," In Yen Tan's glacially paced movie (every shot is relentlessly symmetrical), the actors are squares in graph-paper compositions."
m/ciao_manhattan," You'll hate yourself in the morning, but you'll sit through it."
m/cidade_dos_homens, A lighter but also more emotionally satisfying take on the lives of favela gangstas.
m/cider_house_rules," Admirable and enjoyable, highlighted by superb performances."
m/cincinnati_kid," One of Norman Jewison's core themes of his career is the singular figure and how his or her's goals, desires, and actions affect the people around them."
m/cinderella," When those little mice bust a gut trying to drag that key up hundreds of stairs in order to free Cinderella, I don't care how many Kubrick pictures you've seen, it's still exciting."
m/cinderella_2013," ""Cinderella"" does not try to be transgressive, or even progressive, and unashamedly sells itself as the old-fashioned wish-fulfillment little-girl fantasy that 'Fifty Shades' tries to whip its way out of."
m/cinderella_iii_a_twist_in_time," Sharp direction, a healthy attention to sillyheart detail, and warm voicework lift this sequel away from mediocrity at every turn."
m/cinderella_liberty," Cinderella Liberty, a movie of enormous good intentions. doesn't work for me because I simply can't believe it."
m/cinderella_man," Cinderella Man takes the almost impossibly perfect elements of the saga of underdog boxer James J. Braddock and fills it with emotional gravitas, wrenching danger and a panoramic sense of American life during the Great Depression."
m/cinderella_story," A bibbidy- bobbidy- bomb... more pumpkin than gilded coach, more smelly sneaker than glass slipper."
m/cinema_paradiso," Cinema Paradiso does not cover unfamiliar territory, but it manages to find its own romantic voice and, like the classic films it celebrates, becomes an enchanting fantasy that should happily spirit away even the toughest cynics."
m/cinema_verite_2011, Watching the film is like watching a living wax museum: the glossy appearance functions merely to disguise philosophical hollowness.
m/cinemania," As a documentary, Cinemania succeeds in making the familiar strange and the unfamiliar everyday."
m/circle_of_iron," Five years after his untimely death, Lee's vision project was finally made. Whether or not it's truly his vision, the world will never know. One thing is for sure though - this is one confusing, self indulgent and often tedious film."
m/circo_2011, The film engages sporadically but mostly fails to take advantage of its under-documented milieu.
m/circumstance," With much of the content already distant culturally, the lack of clarity in dialogue and staging causes all subtlety to be lost in translation."
m/circus_of_books," For those wishing to understand a slice of LGBTQ culture and history, Mason's poignant film is a high-priority watch."
m/cirque_du_soleil_worlds_away, Succeeds as a 3D showcase for Cirque performances far more than it does as a narrative feature film.
m/citadel_2012," U.K.-set monster movie has few scares, plenty of noxious overtones."
m/citizen_jane_battle_for_the_city," The film takes us through not just Jacobs's opposition to untrammelled, car-centric construction - starting with a plan to push streets through Washington Square - but also the kind of thinking that drove her activism."
m/citizen_kane, Charles Foster Kane se torna assustadoramente real à medida em que o filme tenta desvendar sua personalidade.
m/citizen_koch_2013," Snaking through a tangle of interlocking ideas, threads and events, it never quite finds a unified focus."
m/citizen_ruth, Payne's biting social satire about the abortion issue is shrewd and raucously entertaining. A smart and subversive comedy
m/citizen_x, A film like Citizen X works to make the killing and the gruesome details of serial murder the least entertaining element of its story and plot.
m/citizenfour, Citizenfour does an excellent job of balancing what we already know with behind-the-scenes discussions of how the information should be released.
m/city_by_the_sea, The film's sluggish pace diminishes its level of suspense.
m/city_heat, ... the movie's never as good as it might have been.
m/city_island," Everybody's got their secrets in City Island, something we're reminded of early and often by writer-director Raymond De Felitta."
m/city_lights, The movie contains some of Chaplin's great comic sequences.
m/city_of_angels," An unusually resonant romantic drama; as a remake that doesn't insult the original, it's borderline miraculous."
m/city_of_ember, A gorgeously imagined and visually sumptuous but still bleak and dystopic vision.
m/city_of_ghosts, In the end the images of Cambodia are what you'll hold onto as you walk out of the theater. They're almost as memorable as the sight of the shockingly enlarged Depardieu.
m/city_of_god, Harsh and extremely shocking. And also one of the most moving and forceful films of the year.
m/city_of_gold_2016," For some, City of Gold might just seem like an interesting and intimate distraction, but for others, it will appear as a powerful love letter to the art of discovery."
m/city_of_industry," The movie plays more like an exercise in noir atmosphere and violence than like a story; the pieces are sometimes nice, but they don't fit."
m/city_of_joy," The unpleasant surprise is Ennio Morricone's score, his worst ever. The final chorus sounds like 10,000 Pekinese puppies stuck in a cave."
m/city_of_joy_2018, Grim yet inspiring docu of rape survivors in war-torn Africa
m/city_of_life_and_death, In shocking but masterly black-and-white images Chuan suggests a smouldering unreal city unhinged by horror.
m/city_of_lost_children," For those with a taste for the unique or who just want to be weirded out by the creatively bizarre, this is an amazing film."
m/city_of_the_living_dead," Drink less [than six beers], you'll be bored with the nonsensical plot. Drink more, you'll probably vomit when you see a girl in the movie literally puke her guts out."
m/city_of_women," It is no longer enough that Fellini deal with the ways women tantalize, dominate, and possess his male heroes. Now he must also deal with the women themselves. For Fellini, this is probably not nearly so much fun."
m/city_of_your_final_destination, The Remains of the Day director has considerable trouble disentangling this latest in his long line of demure chamber pieces.
m/city_slickers, One of the flattest cowboy spoofs to mosey on down the trail in a long while.
m/civic_duty," It's a gloomy, intense and effective little picture, without being the least bit original."
m/civil_action," Schlichtmann may have gone through this conversion in real life, but I just didn't buy it the way Zaillian presents it."
m/civil_brand," Women behind bars! While that's the perfect set-up for a late-night, soft-core cable movie, this flick is guilty of being nothing more than a jailhouse crock."
m/cj7, The tragic events and their oddly cavalier presentation make CJ7 one of the most emotionally-scarring kid flicks since 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
m/claim," It suffers from a slim and fractured narrative, unengaging mode of storytelling and yet another irritating performance from Milla Jovovich."
m/claire_in_motion," It'll come as no surprise then that the performances dazzle, and the script does an expert job of balancing the mystery of the missing person story with the intimacy of Claire's emotional struggle, the latter of which steals the show."
m/claires_camera," There's far worse ways to spend 69 minutes than in the company of his characters as they amble through sunny Cannes idly chatting about love and life, disappointment and fulfillment."
m/clambake," The premise is a fun riff on Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper.... but there's enough here to make the formula different and entertaining enough, even for contemporary families."
m/clara_2019," With a more creative approach to science fiction, Clara would have benefited from a closer look at how women can be people, too."
m/claras_ghost," In the end, there's not enough of distinction or substance to make this absurdist family comedy with a haunted-house angle feel like more than a short's worth of ideas stretched too thin."
m/clash_by_night," There's much to admire here, not least Stanwyck's complex character and the dark, brooding feeling."
m/clash_of_the_titans, Silly togas and hammy performances still can't derail this fitting swan song for effects legend Ray Harryhausen; the sequence in the Medusa's lair is his finest moment.
m/clash_of_the_titans_2," Perhaps Liebesman, whose previous movie was the grim ""Battle: Los Angeles,"" is too drawn to the spectacle of battle to find the balance of camp and seriousness a patently ludicrous film such as ""Wrath of Titans"" seeks."
m/clash_of_the_titans_2010, Give it a break for the sake of a cast that imparts more than comic strip cardboard and you may well find entertainment in this romp with mythical immortality.
m/class," Director Laurent Cantet has pulled together a story that feels startlingly authentic, using Mike Leigh-like methods of extensive improvisation with a cast of real inner-city kids and a real teacher. To paraphrase the Buck Owens/Beatles hit, all they had"
m/class_of_1984, An allegory in which the subtext out-bullhorns the text itself.
m/class_of_1999," Class of 1999 gets a D for dumb, dull and derivative."
m/class_of_nuke_em_high," ""Better"" than much of Troma's output -- but it's all relative."
m/class_rank," ""Class Rank"" is a late bloomer that takes time to find its footing, but once it does, it proves to be as stealthily likable as its characters."
m/clay_pigeons," If serial killers and dead bodies are your idea of laughs, you might get a kick out of Clay Pigeons. Otherwise, you'd be better off skipping this awful black comedy."
m/clean_and_sober," An intense drama about substance abuse that turns out all too predictable, but is nevertheless powerful."
m/cleaner," Beyond the contributions from Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris, however, there's very little worth talking."
m/cleanskin," As if we don't have enough gullible folk believing 7/7 and 9/11 conspiracy theories already, this poor thriller comes along to popularise the paranoia."
m/clear_and_present_danger," Clear and Present Danger isn't quite up to the very high standard set by The Hunt for Red October, but it's a genuine cut above Patriot Games."
m/clear_history," The movie also feels at time like an extended all-star jam episode of Curb. Those are, perhaps not coincidentally, the best, and funniest parts of Clear History."
m/clearing, What is essentially a fairly standard kidnap drama takes on extra interest due to its superb performances and an intriguing structure.
m/clemency_2019, A mature star-driven vehicle elevated by a brilliant performance that deserves all the awards it can get.
m/cleopatras-second-husband," Brutality, poison, torture and other rainy-day fun rules the day and makes this somewhat derivative film an unhinged, sicko treat to watch."
m/clerks, Kevin Smith is a good writer with a great sense of humor. Good jokes and dialogue are cheap and are most of what this film has to offer.
m/clerks_2," The most hilarious, emotionally honest and poetic (yes, poetic) film Kevin Smith has ever made."
m/click," Based on a cute if simplistic idea, Sandler's special-effects comedy is a cross between Back to the Future and Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, with elements of ""Truman Show"" thrown into the uninspired flick."
m/client, Strong performances buoy standard Grisham potboiler.
m/clifford," Grodin's a fine foil and Steenburgen has some lovely, loopy bits, but their characters are handled mildly, almost naturalistically, and that spills onto Clifford, too. Which is deadly here."
m/cliffords_really_big_movie," Unlike television cartoons that sell their souls to make the leap to the big screen, this animated G-rated film is faithful to Norman Bridwell's beloved book series about the big red dog."
m/clip, Clip is certainly competently made and bravely acted by its young cast. But I never felt like I took anything with me after I finished watching the screening
m/cloak_and_dagger," For a movie so obsessed with the line between reality and make-believe, it never knows which side it wants to be on."
m/clock, A nice little wartime romance. Garland and Walker are sweet at the young couple in love.
m/clockers," A superb drama that is part murder-mystery, part portrait of harsh inner-city life."
m/clockstoppers," This is escapist, science-fiction fun, with a little relativity theory thrown in. And it should work just fine for the pre-teen crowd."
m/clockwork_orange, It may not make for escapist viewing but cannot be missed by serious filmgoers.
m/clone_wars, This isn't the Star Wars we've always known and at least sometimes loved.
m/close_2019," Vicky Jewson doesn't try to reinvent the action genre, but instead opts to deliver a fun, entertaining film and pulls it off for the most part."
m/close_encounters_of_the_fifth_kind_contact_has_begun," The pic's claims grow wilder by the minute, and its power to persuade is undercut by narration scripted like a YouTube conspiracy film."
m/close_encounters_of_the_third_kind," [A] great movie, and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema."
m/close_enemies_2018," At best, it's a consummately well-crafted and committed version of a story we've seen play out dozens of times before."
m/close_range," Makes use of every room in the country house and every rock in the country mountains. Adkins gets more acrobatic as the movie progresses, like he's building up to the big jumps, but he still does plenty of fancy footwork and fistwork."
m/close_up_1999," Abbas Kiarostami's brilliantly perceptive film is based on a true story, but is done in mock-documentary style."
m/closed_circuit_2013," It's a story that means to shock us with a tale of wrongdoings and cover-ups at the highest levels, but in this post-Edward Snowden/Chelsea Manning era, does any government-sanctioned chicanery come as a real surprise anymore?"
m/closely-watched-trains," Filmed in minimalist style, it's far more interesting visually than most cluttered and clunky modern Hollywood fare"
m/closer, One of the most viciously insightful relationship films this side of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
m/closer_to_the_moon_2013," Caranfil, who's made several previous features in Romanian, struggles throughout to find the right tone, mostly in vain."
m/closet," It isn't earth-shattering, but, like Veber's film, it disturbs our complacency."
m/closet_monster, Newfoundland filmmaker Stephen Dunn employs fantasy and bizarre flourishes in his imaginative debut drama about a teen's (Blackbird's Connor Jessup) conflicts about his sexuality.
m/cloud_atlas_2012," At 163 minutes Cloud Atlas carries all the marks of a giant folly, and those unfamiliar with the book will be baffled."
m/cloudburst_2012, Dukakis and Fricker are as wonderful in the film as you would expect two veteran and experienced actresses to be. You believe that these two women were a lesbian couple in a committed relationship.
m/clouds_of_sils_maria," Slyly, Assayas stages the film with an intentional staginess: even natural conversations have the ring of written dialogue, and he ends every scene with a theatrical fade to black. This is a complex, bewitching and melancholy drama ..."
m/cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs_2_2013," Pretty to look at, but inferior in every other important way."
m/clover_2020," Abrahams has the right idea for screen energy, keeping things on the move before the whole endeavor tries to aim for cleverness instead of directness."
m/cloverfield, A time capsule of our current fears displaced onto our nightmares.
m/clown_2016, Horror fans will have no problem appreciating this unexpectedly novel exploration into why we hate those damn clowns so much.
m/clowntown_2016," ""ClownTown"" isn't fresh or ghoulishly inviting, easily making it the second best option for those in need of a homicidal clown extravaganza this spooky season."
m/club-dread," We realize it's a spoof of bad movies. But does a satire of bad movies need to be bad, too?"
m/club_paradise," Feels like it was inspired by a People Magazine article, and stretched out into feature length through the dubious overuse of sketch-type comedy droppings."
m/clue, Like a stage farce brought (laboriously) to the screen. An inexhaustible ensemble helps a whole lot.
m/clueless," The movie is aimed at teenagers, but like all good comedies, it will appeal to anyone who has a sense of humor and an ear for the ironic."
m/coach_carter," It's ultimately Jackson, with a winning combination of no-nonsense authority and quirky charisma, not to mention a love of flashy neckties, who breathes life into the film bearing his character's real name."
m/coachella," Captures the fun, beauty and excitement of the annual summertime rock festival of the same name."
m/coal_miners_daughter," The movie isn't great art, but it has been made with great taste and style; it's more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be."
m/cobb," Of all the good and great movies that have slipped through the cracks in recent years, none has been treated as appallingly as Cobb."
m/cobra," Dated and unintentionally laughable, Cobra will always be best known for the catchphrase ""You're a disease and I'm the cure."" Ironically, any audience foolhardy enough to brave this ugly movie is liable to stagger out feeling mighty sick. [Blu-ray]"
m/cobra_verde," Though less apocalyptical than usual, the imagery is as lavish as ever, but the film is wrecked by an underwritten narrative."
m/cockettes," Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit, but for the rest of us -- especially San Francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see."
m/cockneys_vs_zombies, A film far better than it has any right to be by title alone.
m/cocktail," The more you think about what really happens in Cocktail, the more you realize how empty and fabricated it really is."
m/cocktail_2012," A heady blend of terse dialogue, slick cinematography, an electric soundtrack and engaging characters, Cocktail will appeal in particular to the margarita-swilling members of the audience."
m/coco_2017, The animation juggernaut has once more shown how its storytelling acumen and visual splendors are still the surest dance partners in movies today.
m/coco_before_chanel, It doesn't quite fulfil the promise of the subject.
m/coco_chanel_and_igor_stravinsky, A fascinating film whose seduction goes far beyond the affair between Coco and Igor
m/cocoon_the_return," The central weakness of Cocoon: the Return is that the film lacks any compelling reason to exist. Yes, it is a heartwarming film. Yes, the performances are wonderful, and, yes, it's great to see these characters back again. But that's about it."
m/code," sloppy, lazy, and unable to keep up with its own con."
m/code_46, ...wavers between annoying pretentiousness and sheer brilliance.
m/code_8," The ideas outpace the action in a movie that's clearly been made with passion and intelligence, but without the kind of zip that this kind of story demands."
m/code_black_2014," While tracing their journey through this ER, Code Black manages to encapsulate so much of what is wrong with our health care system, but also to point out what's right..."
m/code_name_the_cleaner, Cedric might just want to clean this one right off his resume.
m/code_of_silence," A slick, energetic movie with good performances and a lot of genuine human interest."
m/code_unknown," Too self-consciously obtuse, enigmatic and 'meaningful' for its own good, it demands far more than it gives back in return."
m/coffee_and_cigarettes," Most of the shorts, despite the star power on tap, are negligible."
m/coffee_and_kareem, A cobbled-together hodgepodge of cutting room floor jokes from early 2000s Judd Apatow rip-offs .... and the racial and sexual politics of a Cops rerun.
m/coffin_rock, Hold us on the edge of our seats in a tightly made genre film that boasts outstanding performances and dynamic direction
m/coffy," If only for Grier's performance, Coffy is a must see."
m/cog," The ace in the hole is Groff, who fluidly slides between lip-curled sarcasm and teary-eyed vulnerability-he's the embodiment of the thrill and terror of being a not-so-little boy lost."
m/coherence_2013, An unsatisfactory conclusion ruins an engaging and promising idea.
m/cold_brook, A lovely small-scale story about two men reconnecting with themselves and their families.
m/cold_comes_the_night_2013," Seldom come the thrills in this dogged bag-of-loot B-movie, which chases its tail in scurrying circles around a downscale motel in upstate New York."
m/cold_creek_manor, ...attempts to evoke the essence of Cape Fear -- if Cape Fear had been written by a room full of monkeys.
m/cold_fish," Purportedly based on fact, this is knowingly played with respective manic glee, anguished regret and slinky sexuality by Denden, Fukikoshi and Kurosawa."
m/cold_in_july_2014, Feels like a lost eighties John Carpenter movie- and I mean that in the best way. Don Johnson is stunningly good.
m/cold_moon, Cold Moon is a dark little tale that takes you into the heart of paranoia and speaks to the real and latent violence of a strange transitional period in the American South.
m/cold_mountain," Minghella has meticulously crafted an intimate epic that, while it does have a somewhat cerebral tone, is clearly determined to translate Frazier's vision of human hope amid great brutality to the screen."
m/cold_pursuit, You've never seen an action movie so obsessed with the particulars of dead body movement and disposal.
m/cold_skin, ... a fun but failed film... [Full review in Spanish]
m/cold_souls," An engrossing surreal comedy that takes an inventive look at soul, dreams, emotions, and the emptiness of a life devoid of meaning."
m/cold_turkey," If time has rendered it more a telling social artifact than a comedy classic, the ending remains powerful and thoughtful as a postscript to pandemonium."
m/cold_turkey_2013," Cold Turkey is well-acted, and at times even well-observed, but about 20 minutes of the material actually matters, and the rest is mere putter."
m/cold_war_2," Cold War 2 is competently plotted, tautly edited and superbly acted across the board. This is a political thriller that deserves the billing."
m/cold_weather," Though the film doesn't always deliver on its ambitions, this clever mash-up of genres ripples with an ingratiating confidence."
m/coldwater, Teens trapped at the wilderness camp from hell act out in violent ways in a well-intentioned expose that steps on its message.
m/colette_2018," As a story of a woman who eventually asserts her creative independence and fights for the artistic credit she deserves, Colette is more satisfying intellectually than sensually."
m/collaborator, What takes shape is a character piece that makes a literary job of deconstructing the hostage thriller.
m/collateral," A master of grand operatic gestures, Mann's broad-sided portrayals of machismo don't work when confined to a chamber piece."
m/collateral_beauty, A strenuously uplifting Christmas awards-bait tearjerker.
m/college_road_trip, So wholesome it makes Hannah Montana look like Amy Winehouse.
m/collide_2017," [Hoult] has an easy-on-the-eye physicality and he makes all the running, dodging and high-octane sequences believable and exciting."
m/colliding_dreams," In fact, there is little emphasis on the ""Arab dream"" and considerably more on the dream of a Jewish homeland."
m/colma_the_musical," Colma: The Musical is a great big surprise, a riotous, effervescent and even gritty treat"
m/colombiana," After opening weekend, 'Colombiana' will more than likely be buried in the shallow grave of other femme fatale action duds like 'Aeon Flux,' 'Catwoman' and 'Elektra.'"
m/colonia, This questionable historical thriller is a dictatorship of poor filmmaking.
m/color-of-lies, More thoughtful than taut but a fine addition to the Chabrol canon.
m/color_of_freedom, Full marks to director Bille August for achieving the near-impossible: crafting a film about Nelson Mandela that threatens to send you to sleep and reduces the great man himself to mere background noise.
m/color_of_friendship," Transcendent moments, with resonance for contemporary racial divides, are infused with heart and charm, anchored by a top-notch cast."
m/color_of_money," The Color of Money is a good movie, but perhaps not a good sequel."
m/color_of_night," With so much scenery chewing going on, they must have been able to save a fortune on catering."
m/color_out_of_space, A conceptual melange that is heavy on flavour but light on cohesiveness.
m/color_purple," Spielberg's strategy was to broaden Walker's cunning simplifications, and in blowing up her plot, Spielberg not only makes its flaws more visible, he also uncovers, beneath the feminist rhetoric, the melodrama at its heart."
m/colossal," For all its originality, the film fails to leave much of an impression."
m/colour-me-kubrick," It's a truffle of a movie that may leave you feeling like you ate one too many purple chocolates, but secondary performances by Honor Blackman (remember the original ""Avengers"") and the ever-kooky Ken Russell add texture to the comic motif."
m/comancheros," Lively and cheerful, but too banal to be a top-rate Curtiz or Wayne film; nevertheless it's a pleasingly entertaining film."
m/combat_shock, Giovinazzo's sleazy slice of gonzo filmmaking is a gritty riposte to Reagan's yuppified American Dream.
m/come_and_find_me, Zack Whedon's missing person thriller starts out slow but showcases fine acting by Aaron Paul and his irresistible chemistry with Annabelle Wallis.
m/come_as_you_are_2020, Come As You Are will make you pause for the cause when you consider how frustrating it must be to do something that able bodied people take for granted. It accomplishes this task with Laugh out loud wicked humor with the characters not at them.
m/come_back_to_me," A film in which every character states her motivation out loud, and even so-called ""shocking"" revelations are underlined with a hand-holding voice-over."
m/come_out_and_play, Demands a little patience but also delivers some nasty chills in return.
m/come_sunday," Like the true-life evangelist that inspired it, ""Come Sunday"" preaches a message of tolerance and inclusivity that couldn't be more relevant in a country grappling with its newfound conservatism."
m/come_to_daddy," Led by a solid performance from Elijah Wood, Come to Daddy is a thriller from start to finish with a nice mix of comedy thrown into the mix."
m/come_undone_2000, A delicately managed piece that is by turns intimately detailed and elliptical.
m/come_what_may_2016," A quietly moving, breathtaking and captivating war film that's grounded in humanism and trusts the audience's patience and emotions."
m/comebacks, An exceptionally lame genre parody that plumbs depths of ineptitude heretofore charted only by the marginally less abysmal Date Movie.
m/comedian, A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic.
m/comedians," The movie tries to be serious and politically significant, and succeeds only in being tedious and pompous."
m/comedians_of_comedy_live_at_the_el_rey," When the Kings and Queens have come and gone, it's all about the Comedians"
m/comes_a_bright_day_2012," Props to director Simon Aboud for trying something a little different, even if things didn't quite come together."
m/comes_a_horseman," Moves in fits and starts, and the ending, while a stark reminder of the resilience of the American west, comes out of left field"
m/comet," There's no way to sell this sort of garbage, but everyone involved tries valiantly."
m/comic_book_confidential, The comics themselves are the least interesting part of the movie.
m/comic_con_episode_iv_a_fans_hope, Unquestionably Morgan Spurlock's most entertaining effort since his debut...
m/coming_through_the_rye, Coming Through the Rye comes across as a cute conceit incapable of sustaining a substantial feature.
m/coming_to_america, The main pleasure in America comes in the romancing of prince and pauper. But the comedy is a mere handmaiden.
m/coming_up_roses_2012, This first feature from Ms. Albright does not augur a brilliant future.
m/commandments," Tries to go both ways with the material, mining the plot for laughs and profound existential drama, but nothing gels on either level."
m/commitment_2013," The filmmakers are committed to tragic romanticism. If they muster few thrills and no surprises, at least they don't stoop to a happy ending."
m/commune, A keen vet docu-maker's eye and a chronicler's compassion lends pic real resonance.
m/compadres_2016," A well manufactured piece of comercial cinema that will draw audiences in, especially fans of Omar Chaparro. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/company_man," Not since O.C. and Stiggs has a film strained so hard and so unsuccessfully to get laughs, even bungling the script's few witty lines."
m/complete_history_of_my_sexual_failures," It's a display of gross bad faith both as documentarist and lover, and its subject probably deserves never to get laid again."
m/complete_unknown, A smart and skillfully conceived look at the fluidity of identity and the challenges and rewards of reconfiguring one's life.
m/compliance_2012," I can't say I liked sitting through Compliance, but I can say that I think it's significant, and that it cements Zobel's place as a serious filmmaker with an important voice."
m/computer_chess_2013," It won't be to everyone's taste, for sure - this is no War Games-style pop comedy. But as an act of cultural archaeology I can think of few better."
m/comradeship_1931," benefits substantially from Pabst's intense focus on realism, both physically and psychologically"
m/con_air, It's only all these A-list and almost-A-list actors that makes this anything other than a made-for-USA Networks movie.
m/conan_obrien_cant_stop_2011, The biggest laughs and most intriguing revelations are provided offstage in this slickly produced documentary
m/conan_the_barbarian, No comic book stuff here: the film is dark and gloomy with excessive violence.
m/conan_the_barbarian_2011," Violent, primitive, gut-level cinema aiming to please young male viewers"
m/conan_the_destroyer," There's a goofy MST-3K quality about Conan the Destroyer that aims for family friendly but tries to be sexy as well, something we saw a lot of in the 80s."
m/concerning_violence," A pulsing, echoing trumpet blast-repeated throughout-and some in-your-face political carnage identify Concerning Violence for what it is: a prickly, passionate call to arms."
m/concussion_2013, This is a smart film with a provocative and captivating script.
m/concussion_2015," At its core, Concussion is about the disillusionment of an uncommonly idealistic American immigrant."
m/condemned, Lovers of B-movie fare of Rodriguez and Tarantino will enjoy the gore and violence of this one.
m/condorman," Sincere events surround a moronic lead character who must fumblingly defeat foes and accidentally elude disaster, never truly realizing the dangerousness of his undertakings."
m/coneheads," A respectably funny -- but small -- effort, a reunion party best watched in your living room, while you consume mass quantities of pizza with extra molten lactate extract of hooved mammals."
m/confessions_of_a_burning_man, It's refreshing to see people who willingly and eagerly forego commerce to use their time making art and seeking spiritual meaning.
m/confessions_of_a_dangerous_mind," Brilliantly stylized to suggest its time period and the hero's questionable, if dangerous, state of mind and fever-dreamlike recollections, Confessions never fails to entertain and intrigue."
m/confessions_of_a_shopaholic," Confessions of a Shopaholic plays like both a supremely outmoded chick-lit adaptation and an outrageously obscene gesture as the economy continues to swallow up livelihoods, homes, and hope."
m/confessions_of_a_superhero, Confessions doesn't condescend or mock its subjects because they're such natural entertainers that no audience pandering is necessary.
m/confessions_of_a_teenage_drama_queen," Lindsay Lohan stars in this modest, mildly engaging film as a proudly bohemian resident of Greenwich Village who is transplanted to a prosperous suburb in New Jersey."
m/confetti," Worth a one-night stand, but certainly not a trip down the aisle."
m/confidence," Doug Jung supplies a slick and clever screenplay that maps out all the moves like a chess master teaching a class, while veteran director James Foley casts the movie oh so sweetly."
m/confirmation," Confirmation goes for something more dispassionate and even with the fine acting and a great built-in story, delivers something less enlightening and less enjoyable."
m/confucius_2008," The ancient Chinese philosopher, he say Chow Yun-Fat no good at playing him, no good at all, in this painfully dreary epic biopic."
m/congo," In stupidity, this movie ranks up there among the greats."
m/congo_white_king_red_rubber_black_death, King Leopold and his Congo genocide. Disturbing documentary.
m/connected_an_autoblogography_about_love_death_and_technology, Ambitious but irritating documentary about the Global Village.
m/conor_mcgregor_notorious," ""Though it doesn't dig deep, Notorious: Conor McGregor is exciting, energetic and occasionally revealing..."""
m/conquest_of_the_planet_of_the_apes," The message is that passing power from one to another does not change the essential nature of power. Rather, power contaminates the person (or ape) who wields it."
m/conspiracy_theory," Donner is slick and shallow, but somewhat off his game here."
m/constant_gardener," A rarity this summer, a smart, gripping thriller that takes politics seriously and is also effective as a personal love story, with top notch Fiennes and Weisz in the leads"
m/constantine," Constantine is a pretentiously muddled, emotionally hollow, nonsensical film about Catholic angst, and a cancer-ridden hero who's been to hell and back."
m/constantines_sword, At once enthralling and troubling...does about as good a job as you could hope of distilling a 750-page historical examination of religious zealotry and power into 95 swift minutes.
m/contagion_2011," A masterpiece bound by the genre it lives in, but a masterpiece all the same."
m/contamination," Sometimes boring, sometimes gory, but what a great soundtrack."
m/conte_dhiver_1992," A Rohmer film is a flavor that, once tasted, cannot be mistaken."
m/contempt, A profoundly sad yet beautiful fable about the cinema.
m/continental_divide, Continental Divide charts a love relationship that is hobbed by work.
m/contraband_2012," ""Contraband"" is basically a B-programmer enhanced by a strong cast and a solid storyline."
m/contract_to_kill, Seagal doesn't even look good when he breaks arms or chucks heavies down flights of stairs.
m/contracted," Our inability to identify with [Townshend] means we can't identify with the film's central horror, and thus ""Contracted"" isn't all that unsettling."
m/contracted_phase_ii," Impressively light on its feet given that it's slogging through the twists and turns of a plot heavy on maggots, gore and rotting flesh."
m/control," Corbijn's movie is shot in a stunning high-contrast monochrome, perversely turning Macclesfield's grimness into grandeur. It effortlessly revives a British cinematic style that you might call beautiful realism."
m/conventioneers," One for the time capsule -- not just as an irrefutable visual record of the size, diversity, and vitriolic fervor of the anti-Bush protest movement, but also as a demonstration of how unbridgeable the red-blue divide seemed in those dark autumn months."
m/conversation," The Conversation (1974) is the slowly-gripping, bleak study of electronic surveillance and threat of new technologies examined through"
m/conviction_2010, Swank's unsubtle performance is often an extension of the bluntly dumb lines she and other cast members must deliver.
m/cook_the_thief_his_wife_and_her_lover, It doesn't simply make a show of being uncompromising -- it is uncompromised in every single shot from beginning to end.
m/cookie, A slight but amiable mob comedy. Emily Lloyd is very appealing as the title character.
m/cookies_fortune," The problem with a story that relies almost exclusively on small talk is that they don't call it ""small"" talk for nothing."
m/cookout," Jerryrigged out of painful stereotypes...so offensive, crude, and dumb that the occasional legitimate satire and good-natured family-values message are effectively negated."
m/cool_as_ice," Having established that he can't rap or dance, Vanilla Ice now adds acting to his resume -- call it the tri-imperfecta of pop."
m/cool_dry_place, Could have been much better with slightly tighter pacing and with less drowning in sentimentalism.
m/cool_hand_luke, Cool Hand Luke is the most engaging allegory of Christ.
m/cool_it," It cogently and persuasively lays out its obvious, and yet far-from-embraced, thesis."
m/cooler, Wayne Kramer's misogynistic The Cooler is not for the Mamet faint-of-heart.
m/cooley_high," The film's resistance of pathos starts to feel not just counterintuitive, but also a little ghoulish"
m/cooties, COOTIES is blithely bonkers in a way that feels new and unexpected.
m/cop," Far and away the best thing about it is Mr. Woods, who served as co-producer and demonstrates a clear understanding of what makes great movie detectives great."
m/cop_and_12," It was made either by people who were never children, or who have forgotten what it was like to be one."
m/cop_car," Watching the kids play with guns is always uncomfortable. It's honest though. If kids did this, it would feel fake if they didn't play with the dangerous toys. I feel the film is responsible about it, but rightfully pushes our buttons."
m/cop_land, Stallone's much ballyhooed performance is adequate for what he is. So he decided to drink a bunch of milkshakes and get fat--so what? Millions of Americans do that daily.
m/cop_out," Straining to give limp quotation the luster of homage, Kevin Smith's Cop Out pays tribute mostly to the director's rich heritage of self-amusement."
m/copperhead_2013," ""Copperhead"" crams far too much of its action into its last 30 minutes after a rambling, drawn-out set up."
m/cops_and_robbersons," Chase, as I've already noted, is stuck with a character who goes nowhere, dooming him from the start."
m/copying_beethoven, There's a lot of Romantic hokum here that probably won't play well with many postmodernist sensibilities.
m/coral_reef_adventure," [Fiji diver Rusi Vulakoro and the married couple Howard and Michelle Hall] show us the world they love and make us love it, too."
m/coraline," What Coraline has is a plucky and sassy little girl who's a gas to spend time with. After 100 minutes, you'll follow her anywhere."
m/core," Glorifies real nose-to-the-grindstone smart people, who are our only hope. And makes science fun to boot!"
m/coriolanus_2010," There is a narrative arc to Coriolanus, but it moves along at a snail's pace and the main theme of the film (the pride of Gaius vs. the people he's sworn to protect) isn't a grabber."
m/corky_romano," Ads for Corky Romano feature Corky's face in a pained, possibly post-dental grimace. You'll wear the same horrified expression if you see this spectacularly unfunny movie."
m/cormans_world_exploits_of_a_hollywood_rebel, Only in Corman's World will you bewilderingly witness Jack Nicholson choking back tears on camera for the love of the man who gave him his start in the business.
m/corpo_celeste," Alice Rohrwacher's debut feature exhibits the sort of mannerisms a certain stripe of cinephile tends to dread, on or off the festival circuit."
m/corporate_animals, The cast is full of comedians who deliver but they all orbit around Moore. She has never been this funny. I hope Corporate Animals is the beginning of a Demi Moore comedy renaissance.
m/corporation," Both exhausting and exhaustive, this epic investigation looks at the trans-national behemoths that dominate the globe in ways the old robber barons never dreamed of and the impact of their rapacious appetites on the way we live."
m/corpse_bride," Like so many of Burton's films, Corpse Bride is too much style, not enough substance."
m/correspondence_2016," Even if Tornatore were deliberately aiming for the artificiality that clings to nearly every frame, the pic would still feel needlessly airless, hampered by an Italian-to-English script translation that may be precise but lacks naturalism."
m/corrina_corrina, Actually fairly entertaining in a boring sort of way.
m/corruptor," It surprises by taking us inside Chinatown, where we discover just how sinister and elaborate the relationships between the police and the businessmen can be."
m/cosmopolis," Hinky, kinky, defiantly unlovable ""Cosmopolis"" lands in our laps with bristly self-assurance. ""You asked for this,"" it seems to be saying, one of the few things unspoken amid its torrent of thematically pointed verbiage. ""Let's see if you really want it."""
m/cost_of_a_soul, An impressive debut for film school grad Sean Kirkpatrick is marred by an excessively high body count.
m/cottage_country," The premise is promising, but this Canadian effort squanders it like the spoilsport who spends his time up north watching old VHS tapes."
m/cotton_club," There're always something and someone interesting just around the corner; and, if Coppola seems to have difficulty with the story's narrative line, he does manage to help the audience keep straight the huge cast of characters."
m/count_yorga_vampire, Quarry's commanding performance and some offbeat touches make this a worthy fang flick.
m/countdown_2019," [Countdown] also doesn't seem to care about its characters, its premise or any sense of coherence, so there's no reason viewers should, either."
m/countdown_to_zero, ...the slick packaging ... and obvious attempt to capitalize on the critical and financial success of An Inconvenient Truth is disheartening.
m/counterfeiters, Counterfeiters is distinctive enough in its characterization of Bridger and so efficient and engaging in its world-building that its mishandled climax shouldn't weigh so heavily against it.
m/country_bears, All of the bears are engaging characters and the cameo singing voices fit well into the film.
m/country_strong," A country music drama with a big heart but not enough focus, Country Strong tackles fame, artistic expression, addiction and love, although none of them deeply enough."
m/couple," A few genuinely tense scenes are not enough to overcome a thin script, weak direction and an unceasingly high-strung score."
m/couples_retreat, This intermittently funny tale of four couples undergoing relationship therapy struggles hard for its occasional laughs.
m/courage_under_fire, Courage Under Fire packs its share of emotional punches while it's unfolding. It's just that the blows don't leave any bruises to dwell on once the final credits begin rolling.
m/courageous," Profound without being preachy, ""Courageous"" never forgets to entertain"
m/court, Court is another reminder that we need drastic changes in the way our judiciary functions; it raises relevant questions but doesn't provide answers.
m/court_jester," A flawlessly executed, beautifully designed genre parody."
m/cousin_jules," For 91 minutes, the pleasure of the Guiteauxes' company is ours. We are ultimately the richer for it."
m/covenant," No one has bothered to develop a coherent story or remotely likable characters to sustain the CGI effects, ear-splitting music, and hyperactive editing."
m/cover," Fo shizzle, if it doesn't attain the well-deserved status of a camp classic, only the straight-to-video aesthetic will be to blame."
m/cowboys," Even with a closing that breaks with tradition, The Cowboys is not as eventful as one would have hoped for in a John Wayne movie."
m/cowboys-for-christ," With The Wicker Tree, Hardy may have sired a long-awaited second film - but it only leaves the impression that The Wicker Man had better remained a single child whose brilliance could be untainted by the presence of inferior siblings."
m/cowboys_and_aliens," Two movies (and two genres) for the price of one, this ultimate popcorn movie of the summer is a mishmash by design, in which Bond meets Han Solo/Indiana Jones, though more effective as Western than sci-fi thriller."
m/coyote_ugly, It looks like a big-budget version of a Miller's Genuine Draft commercial.
m/cq, A maddening mishmash of styles and genres with absolutely no dramatic resonance.
m/cracks," An auspicious debut for Scott, but one whose ingredients are too familiar to really fizz. Green is great, though, in a dark-tinged role that plays to her strengths."
m/cradle_2_the_grave," Yes, Cradle 2 the Grave is predictable. Yes, it's admittedly dumb. But if you don't walk away from this one with a smile, you probably don't like action movies."
m/cradle_of_champions," The result is both a stirring sports doc and a rich nonfiction drama, populated by characters who could have stepped out of a Damon Runyon story."
m/cradle_will_rock," You'll marvel at it .. simply marvel. But you may not ""feel"" until the climax."
m/craft," The players are game, performing earnestly... But soon there are more holes than ideas in the plot, characters are poorly developed and it becomes apparent that the filmmakers are more interested in wild visual imagery than telling a story."
m/craigslist_joe_2012," A generally agreeable but perhaps hopelessly meandering nonfiction snapshot of one guy's attempt to hit the road for 31 days and live off the alms of America's new, digital age thrift store."
m/crank," Ridiculously, incomprehensibly, undeniably cool, brilliantly, passionately and hysterically original; pure cinema heaven."
m/crank_high_voltage," Crank: High Voltage promises something outrageous and then over-delivers, permanently deflowering and deforming the mind of anyone lucky enough to be in the audience."
m/crash_pad," Crash Pad is a perfectly fine way to pass ninety minutes, but you'll soon forget you ever saw it."
m/crawl," There's little originality but a decent amount of suspense, a great deal of blood and some promise."
m/crawl_2019, You want big alligators attacking people? You'll definitely get big alligators attacking the sh-t out of people.
m/crazies," The movies Romero produced during his heyday were as ferocious, uncompromising and provocative as those of Peckinpah, Altman and Scorsese..."
m/crazy-beautiful, Has the feel of a slightly elevated Afterschool Special.
m/crazy_about_tiffanys," An infomercial that qualifies as the worst kind of ""chick picture."""
m/crazy_as_hell," A morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-TV look, rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense."
m/crazy_eyes_2012, Crazy Eyes feels a bit like a more light-hearted Leaving Las Vegas or a more energetic Somewhere -- comparisons that are meant as compliments.
m/crazy_heart," Crazy Heart is quiet, gentle, heart-bruised more than heart-broken, and it lingers in the memory after you've seen it, like a song you can't get out of your head."
m/crazy_horse_2010," Revealing, impressionistic peek at the creation of a new show at Paris's famed erotic dancing club."
m/crazy_in_alabama," Crazy in Alabama manages to be both sweeping and small, quirky and sincere, and offers Melanie Griffith her best role in years."
m/crazy_love_2007," Way before the recently reunited womanizer pubophile Joey Buttafuoco and teen spouse-shooter Amy Fisher, both of whom walked out on their marriages to get it on all over again, there was Burton Pugach and Linda Riss. Don't ask."
m/crazy_on_the_outside," Tim Allen's directorial debut, a strained comedy drama about an ex-con trying to go straight, isn't nearly crazy enough."
m/crazy_people, ...never becomes anything more than an inoffensive time-waster...
m/crazy_rich_asians, The only excuse you have not to see Crazy Rich Asians is because you hate love.
m/crazy_stupid_love_2011, The movie suffers perhaps from too many characters and subplots but all the actors appear to have fun with their characters.
m/creative_control, More stylishly compelling and seamlessly produced than it is imaginative.
m/creature_2011, Production designer Fred Andrews makes his directorial debut here and can't even manage coherency.
m/creed_2015," Rousing in spirit, surprisingly emotional and visually dynamic, filmmaker Ryan Coogler's first studio movie is a worthy successor to the 'Rocky' movies."
m/creed_ii," For Creed II to do a Creed style dramatic exploration of the aftermath of pure '80s cheese is a bold move, and a successful one."
m/creep_2014," Creep isn't particularly gory -- certainly not for a horror film. Rather, Josef's eccentricities surface in surprising ways that, while not bloody, are certainly horrifying and strangely funny."
m/creep_2_2017," A blackly hilarious, increasingly intense showdown between two very engaging and unusual characters."
m/creeping_flesh, Peter Cushing in a hand-wringing performance is Professor Emmanuel Hildern.
m/creepshow," A darn good horror anthology, which is pretty darn rare."
m/creepshow_2," The episodes are marginally interesting, but each is a little too long. And each could be fully explained in a one-sentence synopsis."
m/creepy," A film that not only amply merits its name, but would make Norman Bates scratch his head at the sheer weirdness of what goes on here behind closed doors."
m/cries_and_whispers," The most haunting death story in the movies, exquisitely photographed, like a reverie just before the afterlife."
m/crime_after_crime_2011," While most people would do anything to get out of prison, this filmmaker fought his way in. Going undercover embedded in a legal defense team to expose legal improprieties. As art intertwines with struggle, in a strategy of creative cinematic espionage."
m/crime_and_punishment_in_suburbia, Every single thing about Crime and Punishment in Suburbia is stolen and tired.
m/crime_of_padre_amaro," A melodrama, a film that doesn't say priests are bad but observes that priests are human and some humans are bad."
m/crime_spree," Mirman seems lost in the uncomplicated, formulaic material of Crime Spree. It's as if he wasn't really sure where he wanted the film to go."
m/crimes_of_the_heart," There are moments when the movie doesn't seem to know where it's going, but for once that's a good thing because the uncertainty almost always ends with some kind of a delightful, weird surprise."
m/criminal_2016, An awkward memory-transplant thriller which could have done with its own intelligence graft ...
m/criminal_activities, It owes as much to Quentin Tarantino as the four bunglers owe to Eddie. Yet it doesn't feel like a mere imitation; it has too much wit and too many striking performances for that.
m/crimson_peak," Crimson Peak will make you believe in ghosts, but it will also make you believe in the magic of the movies yet again."
m/crimson_tide, There is so much excellent about this picture it is hard to know where to begin.
m/crip_camp_a_disability_revolution," ""Crip Camp"" proves some success stories only grow more powerful with age, and their ability to inspire action is timeless."
m/critical_care," The film is a stimulating mix of a medical drama and a courtroom showdown, with broad comedy from Brooks, a little sexual blackmail, and a touching subplot involving another terminally ill patient who thinks he is being visited by the devil."
m/critical_thinking," ""Critical Thinking"" is an inspiringly uplifting film reminding us of the potential of each and every student out there."
m/critters, The script's infectious sense of humor and a highly appealing performance by Grimes as the teenage hero help disguise the familiarity of it all.
m/critters_3, Is this the one in the apartment or the one in space? Does it matter?
m/critters_attack_2019, Quite boring and defeats the whole idea of a sequel by dodging everything that makes these movies so fun.
m/crocodile_dundee," The definition of a cheesy 1980s movie. Charming, though."
m/crocodile_dundee_2," The violence is still pleasantly paddling-pool stuff, but the disarming G'day factor has been pasteurised away."
m/crocodile_dundee_in_los_angeles," As thin and ephemeral as a TV variety show from the 1960s, and just about as au courant."
m/cronicas," Writer-director Sebastian Cordero keeps the moral conundrums on low boil while allowing the ominous, sweltering atmosphere to seep beneath your skin."
m/cronos, There were no unnerving images in Cronos. There's a lot of blood and gore -- but that's rather routine.
m/crooked_arrows," While 'Crooked Arrows' certainly isn't a good film by any objective standard, it has a good heart, and proves far more tolerable than many blockbuster sports movies."
m/crooked_house," Crooked House plunges us into an unexpected sense of mayhem and destruction, and what else can we do but give it the respect it so richly deserves?"
m/crooklyn, As a director...Lee's standard bag of gimmicks reaches a most unpleasant zenith here.
m/cropsey," Cropsey continues what's been a welcome trend this year toward documentaries with strong, surprising narratives."
m/cross_creek," The script may take some liberties with the facts, but when the resulting movie is this likeable you soon cease to care."
m/cross_of_iron," Peckinpah indulges in endless combat scenes (this was his only war movie), which try the patience of viewers who came for the real story."
m/crossfire_1989, a drawn-out hour of investigation that looks like a schoolyard game of C.S.I.
m/crossfire_trail, The hero's mission is clear -- to protect and serve -- and Selleck conveys that with a silent strength.
m/crossing_delancey, A well directed and sensitive portrayal of match-making in the 20th century
m/crossing_guard," though Penn doesn't always seem to know where he's going, his movie doesn't altogether miss its destination."
m/crossing_over, The only debate that Crossing Over will inspire is whether or not it's supreme awfulness is enough to qualify it for so-bad-its-good status.
m/crossing_the_line_2007," One commendable but far too brief section of the documentary, presents through horrific images and testimony, the gruesome atrocities visited upon the DPRK civilians which exceeded even the US mass carnage against the Vietnamese in that invasion."
m/crossover," Crossover skimps on court-level pyrotechnics (we get a game in the beginning and, of course, a big game at the end, and that's about it) in favor of dry urban melodrama."
m/crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon, Just might be one of the best kung fu movies ever made.
m/crow," [Proyas] employed a lot of talent in order to make this film heavy with the dark atmosphere of gritty, rainy megalopolis without hope for its inhabitans."
m/crow_salvation," Although I wouldn't quite go so far as to recommend it, the movie does have a terrific look and some intriguing, albeit overly dramatic, acting."
m/crow_the_city_of_angels, Little more than a subpar remake of the first outing.
m/crown_and_anchor," Even with its nagging, lumbering elements, Crown and Anchor succeeds in taking a hard look on the how our childhoods turn us into the misfit adults we are, and not to find answers, but to simply (and starkly) observe the effects."
m/crown_heights_2017," The tragic story of Colin Warner doesn't so much come to life on the screen as it is responsibly recalled in Crown Heights, aided by effective performances and some streamlined storytelling."
m/crown_vic," Set over the course of one difficult night shift, Joel Souza presents a down-and-dirty look at the often thankless career of a beat cop in his gritty thriller."
m/crshd, It's a rare movie to acknowledge that technology is not just a feature of young people's lives but often the very thing providing the fodder that drives all discussions.
m/cruel_intentions," It works only sporadically, and more as a comic outing than as a vicious battle of sexual predation."
m/cruel_intentions_2," if he intended to produce a straightforward two-hour original prequel, the writer-director would have made certain that the script was less meandering."
m/cruising," The most shocking thing about Cruising (shown in 2007 Cannes Fest), which occupies a unique place in film history, is its thematic and visual audacity, the fact that it was made by a mainstream director (Friedkin) and studio; it will never happen again."
m/crumb, an absolutely disarming documentary and one of the very best of its kind
m/crush_the_skull, A sharp offering that should send savvy horror fans home happy.
m/crusoe, Crusoe is a film with a few important things to say and a magnificent way of saying them.
m/cry-baby, Better than Grease. Overlooked but fabulous John Waters' musical.
m/cry_freedom, One of the best films of 1987 with its searing condemnation of racism and violence in South Africa.
m/cry_in_the_dark," Streep -- yes, with another perfect accent -- brings her customary skillfulness to the part. It's not a showy performance, but the heroine's internal struggle seems to come from the actress' pores."
m/cry_of_the_owl-2009," Overall, it's the kind of technically proficient, deliberately paced, grim sleepwalk that leaves one cold rather than cracked open."
m/cry_wolf_2005," The current state of the American horror genre is, sadly, in a current state of horror."
m/crying_game," If you're waiting for something explosive to happen, that may be the case, but if you're absorbing the meticulous and subtle character interaction, the pacing is perfect."
m/crypto, The characters all feel like they've been copied and pasted from hundreds of other movies that end with armed standoffs in some featureless field or warehouse.
m/crystal_fairy, Uneven- but often hilarious. Gaby Hoffman is terrific.
m/csa_the_confederate_states_of_america," Ingenious and disturbing, it's not really about the past but the present -- a witty successor to 'Fahrenheit 9/11.'"
m/csny_deja_vu," CSNY fires up this rousing rockumentary, the camera's rough cut tendencies not withstanding. In other words, call me stuff like geriatric and bloated - as malice-minded talking head reporters do - but whatever you do, don't diss my peace activism."
m/cthulhu," A trippy, unsettling experience with a clear eye for mesmerizing visuals. Genre fans grown weary by today's mainstream spate owe it to themselves to seek out this grim, creatively sumptuous, unapologetically chilling indie effort."
m/cub," This backwoods camping adventure and folk-legend fusion flies off the rails, unleashing a grotesque and vile nature in every character. ""Cub"" will leave you wanting to pack up your things and head home early."
m/cuba_and_the_cameraman, ... Cuba and the Cameraman is sustained by the strong bonds of trust which the gregarious [director Jon] Alpert has evidently been able to maintain with Cubans from various echelons of this theoretically classless society.
m/cuban_fury_2013," You can dress it up all you want, but there's no hiding the fact that Cuban Fury is as bland as they come."
m/cubby," The character of Mark Nabel wouldn't seem out of a place in a Will Ferrell slacker comedy, or one of Tim Robinson's more outlandish sketches - a familiar comic character, but one that feels thrillingly alien within a film aimed at queer audiences."
m/cube," Vincenzo Natali directs this science fiction thriller with an intriguing premise. Unfortunately, there's little to Cube besides that premise and some creative filmmaking techniques."
m/cube_2_hypercube, A sleek continuation of an unexpectedly good franchise.
m/cuck, Cuck is a hard watch but [Rob] Lambert's willingness to look directly at a social phenomenon frequently trivialised or abstracted from the human does him credit.
m/cujo," The movie is as nasty and single-minded as Cujo himself: It's simple, and it works."
m/cult_of_chucky," May be the best Chucky movie ever. It's at least the best since Bride of Chucky... It'll surprise even the biggest Chucky fans. And that's me. I'm the biggest Chucky fan and it surprised me. Certainly, this is the most ambitious Chucky."
m/cunningham," A must for dancers and fans of the art-form, ""Cunningham"" is a meditative and often beautiful portrait of dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham."
m/cupcakes_2015," With a big handful of Almodvar thrown into Cupcake's mixing bowl, and input from the Scissor Sisters' Babydaddy, it will surely find its natural audience."
m/curious_case_of_benjamin_button, A wildly ambitious fantasy which contains many intriguing elements and superb production values but ultimately fails to cohere as the epic tragedy it wants to be.
m/curly_sue, Any similarity between Curly Sue and Shirley Temple is practically intentional.
m/curse_of_chucky, 'Curse of Chucky' [is] alarmingly good...Chucky fans should rejoice as [it] is clearly going to re-ignite the franchise for years to come. Chucky has never looked better...
m/curse_of_frankenstein," [A] routine horror picture, which makes no particular attempt to do anything more important than scare you with corpses and blood ..."
m/curse_of_the_cat_people, It makes a rare departure from the ordinary run of horror films and emerges as an oddly touching study of the working of a sensitive child's mind.
m/curse_of_the_demon," This was a first-rate classic horror story, whose richness is enhanced because the shock scenes are understated and left mostly to one's imagination."
m/curse_of_the_golden_flower," Pardon the momentary lapse into geek-speak, but Zhang Yimou's latest wu xia spectacle Curse of the Golden Flower is ten kinds of awesome."
m/curse_of_the_jade_scorpion," The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is, flat out, the funniest comedy Woody Allen has made in years."
m/curse_of_the_pink_panther," Yes, because we all know that the American equivalent to Peter Sellers is ... Ted Wass."
m/curtiz," You don't have to be a film buff to dislike Curtiz, but it doesn't hurt."
m/curvature," The story is not really new, but it has enough science fiction to satisfy viewers tired of superheroes."
m/curve, Rare that you'll see this many moronic plot twists in just one movie.
m/custer_of_the_west, A lumbering biopic on the misunderstood courageous Civil War and Indian fighter General George Armstrong Custer.
m/cut_bank," If it be fated that every state eventually gets a Fargo knockoff to call its own, Montana will be disappointed that there's turned out to be as bloodless as Cut Bank."
m/cut_shoot_kill," In a summer plagued by a lack of originality, Cut Shoot Kill slashes the competition."
m/cut_snake," It's a minor story with minor ambitions, yet it manages to deliver a fully satisfying and moving experience."
m/cutie_and_the_boxer, A finely textured and beautifully told story of two Japanese artists in New York and their challenging 40-year marriage.
m/cutters_way," The result is nothing less than a modern masterpiece, and a film ripe for rediscovery."
m/cutthroat_island, It takes a two-hour act of will to keep facing the screen during this moribund movie.
m/cyber_seniors," If there's a film that will make you want to finally accept that friend request from your grandparents, this one is it."
m/cypher," A bit too clever and precious for it's own good, it's a fairly decent yet predictable near-future thriller."
m/cyrano_de_bergerac_1950," ...good acting, eloquent dialogue, high adventure, and, most of all, heartbreaking romance."
m/cyrus," All the improvised dialogue, herky-jerk camerawork and social discomfort of previous Duplass films is here, along with name actors playing damaged but ultimately human characters."
m/d2_the_mighty_ducks, Ducks return to ice in sequel that focuses on sportsmanship.
m/d3_the_mighty_ducks, Rousing conclusion of the trilogy following through on several character arcs.
m/d_tox, It's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions.
m/d_train," A very different movie than you think, this is a warm, generous, kindhearted film that dares to go places other such comedies fear to tread."
m/da_sweet_blood_of_jesus," Given free rein by his fans' money, Lee has made a movie that's both uncompromising and often inexplicable."
m/da_vinci_code, ... more entertaining and satisfying than the novel.
m/dad, A multidimensional family drama that deals squarely with the challenges and difficulties of old age and a long marriage.
m/daddy_day_camp," The screenplay is attributed to three writers. That means if the film's funny parts were divided evenly among them, they each wrote zero."
m/daddy_day_care, A failed third-rate sitcom is exactly what Daddy Day Care looks and sounds like.
m/daddy_issues_2020," A feeble comedy with a duller-than-dull script, colorless characters and a posh-accented ""star"" who seems like a born bit player"
m/daddys_home_2," Daddy's Home 2 makes me feel sorry for disparaging A Bad Moms Christmas. That movie is still lacking, but at least the filmmakers managed to get the most out of the actors who played the bad grandmas."
m/daddys_home_2014, It's by-numbers filmmaking that rarely adds up to anything worth the price of admission.
m/daddys_little_girls," ...this is easily Perry's best film, which is to say it's serviceably mediocre rather than godawful."
m/dads-army," It's a time-honored style of comedy, accessible to a broad audience, and it works on its own terms, without too many ill-advised attempts at modernization."
m/dagon," For our money, Dagon is very possibly the best Lovecraft movie produced so far (we're overlooking Carpenter's underrated In The Mouth of Madness because that was only tentatively inspired by Lovecraft's mythos)."
m/daguerrotype," ... Daguerrotype is certainly a mess, though it's easy to surmise why he was attracted to bring his interest in ghosts, phantoms, and psychological displacement to cinema's birthplace."
m/dahmer," Renner's performance as Dahmer is unimpeachable, fascinating without being charismatic."
m/dai_nipponjin," As in life, the nonmonster stuff goes on too long. But wait until the giant baby shows up."
m/daisy_kenyon, The women's pic is given a far better treatment than it deserved.
m/daisy_miller, The first and perhaps the final question to be asked about Peter Bogdanovich's adaptation of Henry James' novella is just why he chose to embark on it.
m/daleks_invasion_earth_2150_ad," Very tame but marginally better than the first, with the Daleks unsurprisingly coming to grief after invading a ruined London of the future and robotising the inhabitants. Very variable special effects and often excruciatingly cheapo sets."
m/dalida_2017," Despite running just over two hours, there is almost no sense of who Dalida was beyond the private lover and the public performer."
m/dallas_buyers_club_2013," ...while the film might not drop the cumulative emotional anchor you may expect...it's a smartly entertaining tale, delivered with respect for its subject matter, but also wisely knows you can be fun and funny even in the arena of an AIDS drama."
m/damage," Stephen and Anna are wrong to do what they do in Damage, but they cannot help themselves. We know they are careening toward disaster. We cannot look away."
m/damascus_cover, Overstuffed with groaningly familiar espionage tropes.
m/dames," The movie belongs to Berkeley and his wondrous production numbers, which are all erotic fantasies."
m/damien_omen_ii, Damien is really just more of the same as The Omen.
m/damned_united," Smarter than Escape To Victory, more fun than Bend It like Beckham, but not quite the title-winning charge we were hoping for. Might challenge for a Champions League spot though."
m/damsel," Throughout its twisty path, Damsel unfolds against a polished backdrop of the lush outdoors."
m/damsels_in_distress," If Easy A was Mean Girls's copycat little sister, then Damsels is her impossibly cool older cousin."
m/dan_in_real_life," Steve Carell's pursed-lipped awkwardness and sweet buffoonery are both in fine form, but those endearing qualities aren't nearly enough to salvage Peter Hedges's incorrigibly hackneyed film."
m/dana_carvey_squatting_monkeys_tell_no_lies," A Carvey comedy special comes with special problems -- for one, a star with minimal skills for stand-up comedy. He's wildly repetitious, punishing to hear in his gnawing on the same mirth-free shtick."
m/dance_academy_the_comeback," What it lacks in surprises, it makes up for in poise, a standard coat of glossy-imaged polish, and an affable teen melodrama air."
m/dance_flick," Not a perfect 10, but the Wayans crew hit their mark more than they miss."
m/dance_girl_dance," Dorothy Arzner's best film, Dance, Girl, Dance, spotlights women's inner worlds."
m/dance_me_outside," [Dance Me Outside] packs a lot of punch into an offbeat drama that at first appears to be headed nowhere. Ultimately, though, you feel involved in lives that end up touching home."
m/dance_with_me," The movie is largely gimmicky melodrama lathered with cheap, feel-good sentimentality."
m/dancer_2016," There have been at least half a dozen good ballet documentaries in the last few years, but none with as riveting a subject as Sergei Polunin."
m/dancer_in_the_dark," Von Trier is poking at subconscious safety nets we turn to for reassurance in ways both pretentious and provocative, depending on the predisposition of the beholder."
m/dancer_upstairs, Director John Malkovich does a slow-motion Costa-Gavras.
m/dances_with_wolves," [A] beautiful and soft-headed frontier epic, which looks at Native Americans through New Age-colored glasses."
m/dancing_across_borders," An illuminating profile but a sloppy snapshot of the immigrant experience, Anne Bass(TM)s documentary charts the rise of Cambodian Sokvannara Sar on America(TM)s ballet stages."
m/dancing_at_lughnasa, so beautifully captures the details of its time and place and its characters' lives that it's difficult to resist being drawn in.
m/dancing_at_the_blue_iguana," The strippers each fit into nice clearly delineated archetypes (a function of most strippers' personas, but one you don't expect to be as well defined in their real lives)."
m/dancing_in_jaffa_2013, This heartwarming doc illustrates the power of dance to bring people together.
m/danger_close_2017," By focusing on Quade's absolute respect for military service and authority, Salzberg and Tureaud miss an opportunity to explore her pragmatic conservatism, lyrically expressed in her profiles of unquestioning heroism."
m/danger_close_2019," While the brutal and unflinching battle scenes are superbly crafted with an intensity that's truly unsettling, the film is let down by its overreliance on tired clichés and generic war movie tropes."
m/danger_diabolik," Although it's too long and eventually loses track of Itself, Danger: Diabolik is very nearly the movie Barbarella should have been."
m/dangerous_beauty," Only McCormack manages to breathe any urgency into a tale that takes far too long to escape the fate of too many films set in Venice, in which San Marco and the Grand Canal's gondola fleet overwhelm story and characters."
m/dangerous_ishhq, What at first appears to be a conventional thriller about a woman's desperate efforts to rescue her kidnapped fianc takes a mystical turn.
m/dangerous_liaisons_2012," Revenge may be a dish best served cold, as the novel suggested, but steamy adaptations simply can't be doled out lukewarm."
m/dangerous_lies_2020," Uninspired woman-in-jeopardy story has violence, swearing."
m/dangerous_lives_of_altar_boys," Though certainly original in form, Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation, doubled with a deafening score."
m/dangerous_minds," There's not enough backstory for or insight into any of the characters, which keeps them at an emotional distance."
m/dangerous_woman," It's acting of an order that deserves better than the film's cheap, final grope for melodrama."
m/daniel_and_ana," The director effusively fixates on the siblings' post-traumatic stress, conveyed throughout fancily composed and classically scored scenes that suggest parodies of Michelangelo Antoninoi's ennui-clogged style."
m/daniel_isnt_real, Echoes of... Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant-era Polanski run throughout the film but Daniel Isn't Real is very much its own distinct fever dream of chimerical unease. Highly recommended.
m/danika, Upsetting that it had to go for the easy genre closer instead of exploring the universal parental mentality that Danika had going for it until the final half-hour.
m/danny_collins," A familiar late-in-life redemption narrative, made surprisingly palatable by Pacino's winning comic bravado, a superb supporting cast, and currents of real feeling that cut through the expected bromides about the emptiness of fortune and fame."
m/danny_deckchair," A highly original and delightfully funny romantic comedy, Danny Deckchair just goes to show that dreams do have wings and love can sometimes fall out of the sky."
m/danny_says, It ends on a muted whimper of a note that one doesn't expect given that the film's subject is such an immensely entertaining raconteur.
m/danny_the_dog, Jet Li lets fly with his fists and feet of fury. Which is all to the good. It's the sentimental story that screenwriter Luc Besson sandwiches in between fights that induces a gag reflex.
m/dantes_peak," Leslie Bohem's script is almost self-parody, but director Roger Donaldson keeps a straight face throughout."
m/darby_ogill_and_the_little_people, This excellent fantasy romps through the folklore world of Ireland.
m/dare," The actors, all great camera subjects, help give director Adam Salky's overly pat movie a trace of confessional conviction."
m/daredevil," Spectacular set-piece shunts spectacular set-piece, without a strong narrative arc to hook the viewer."
m/darjeeling_limited," The ingredients that have increasingly defined Wes Anderson's films seem, with The Darjeeling Limited, to have become something like limitations."
m/dark-shadows-2010," The clownish vampire with a Napoleonic hairdo and blood dripping from his chin is a great vehicle for the chameleon Johnny Depp, but the sort of fun we had with the Addams Family is also missing"
m/dark_blue," Refreshingly devoid of flashiness or artificially pumped-up action, this gripping, well-constructed police thriller ... showcases a tightly controlled performance from Kurt Russell."
m/dark_blue_world, The filmmakers give us a bitter taste of both the Nazi and Red regimes and take pains to remind us that one form of totalitarianism is no less cruel than another.
m/dark_city," ...what counts here is the show, the creation of a strange world by a filmmaker who clearly knows science fiction and fantasy, past and present, and wants to share his love for it."
m/dark_crimes," Glum, degrading and dull exploitation film featuring Jim Carrey as ""the last honest cop in Poland."""
m/dark_crystal, One of Henson's shining moments in modern-day cinema
m/dark_days," These are not mole-men, these are people who once had lives like everyone else. In the cold, in the dark, it's all too easy to forget that. Singer makes sure that we don't."
m/dark_encounter," [Carl] Strathie succeeds in demonstrating his skill, but the result is rather overcooked."
m/dark_habits, It's hard to imagine how it could be any more Almodovar-esque than it is.
m/dark_half, The film's biggest disappointment is that it doesn't develop its preternatural opening theme.
m/dark_horse_2011," Solondz's most waywardly endearing film, his gentlest triumph."
m/dark_matter, A middling academic drama that passes pleasantly enough for roughly an hour before detouring into a tacked-on tragic climax.
m/dark_of_the_sun," Iron-fisted Rod Taylor actioner, also starring Jim Brown."
m/dark_passage, The film is almost stolen by bizarre performances by both Agnes Moorhead and Clifton Young.
m/dark_phoenix, A lazy treadmill of a sci-fi morality play that wastes a terrific cast. A numbingly dull game of mutant checkers that has no idea how to tell a woman's story except filtered through the eyes of men.
m/dark_places_2015, The direction is key in this film. Mystery shows itself little by little and guides you step by step. This simple decision creates a trust-fear relationship between the characters and the audience. [full review in Spanish]
m/dark_river_2018," Once again, Barnard delivers an intimate take on a difficult subject, raising anticipation for her future work should she decide to scale up."
m/dark_skies_2013," It is by no means a great movie. But it's well made, well acted, and reasonably tense and involving. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
m/dark_summer_2015," The cacophony of visions, broken mirrors, and mutilations only points to the ghost in the machine respecting The Craft as its spirit animal."
m/dark_tide_2011," An eternal morass of dreary conversations, paper-thin character development, and plot convolutions that were old hat by the time Jaws 2 showed up."
m/dark_touch_2013, De Van appears to think that throwing every horror cliche in the book at something will make for atmosphere.
m/dark_victory," One of Bette Davis' best acted, most enjoyable melodrama, in which she gloriously plays a dying blind woman."
m/dark_was_the_night," As generic as its title, Jack Heller's monster-in-the-woods horror film aspires to be the stuff of nightmares but instead merely lulls the viewer into an untroubled sleep."
m/dark_water," Salles realizes the rotten dank desperation of her life so vividly that he has made, in effect, the first collapse-of-the- middle-class horror movie."
m/dark_waters_2019," A movie with a story as urgent as this needn't look lovely, and yet Dark Waters often does, finding beautiful patterns and motifs in the quotidian stuff of folders and desk lamps and stacks of paper."
m/darkest_hour_2017," Balances the great orator's public triumphs with more vulnerable private moments of self-doubt, elevating the inner workings of British government into a compelling piece of populist entertainment."
m/darkman," It comes on exceptionally strong, sure of itself and its basic, primitive hold on the audience."
m/darkman_ii_the_return_of_durant," Horrible sequel, even for straight-to-video fare. Why would Durant be a big villain? He was a henchman. Darkman III was a tad better, but both sequels lack the Raimi touch."
m/darkness, One can only imagine how much scarier some of Balaguer's images would be without the abrasive soundtrack.
m/darkness_falls, Darkness Falls is a no-brainer that aims to entertain even if it doesn't enlighten.
m/darkon," A documentary that peers casually into the inner workings of a game and lets us laugh at -- er, with? -- the participants."
m/darlin," Every few minutes, I feel yanked out of its world and reminded that I'm watching an erratic albeit ambitious film. It's hard to be completely, emotionally invested in the story."
m/darling_2016," Using the simplest of settings - and familiar genre devices - Mickey Keating's horror outing ""Darling"" manages to conjure an effectively unsettling miasma."
m/darling_companion, Diane Keaton's frequent bouts of hysteria are numbing in this otherwise amiable shaggy dog story.
m/darling_lili, [Julie Andrews] is doing what she does best and what her fans expect her to do.
m/daryl," To be sure, we`re not talking about a bad movie, just one that could have been so much better."
m/date_and_switch," A largely enjoyable and credible coming-of-age romp, despite some forced broadness and uneven pacing."
m/date_night, The old mistaken identity device (brilliantly handled in Hitchcock's North by North West) that leads innocent characters into deadly danger provides the pivot for a comedy about the pitfalls of marriage as a vehicle for long term relationships
m/daughter_from_danang, The obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc.
m/daughter_of_the_wolf, A subpar vehicle for an action star who deserves better.
m/daughters_of_the_dust," It is an astonishing, vivid portrait not only of a time and place, but of an era's spirit."
m/dave, Nothing but entertaining - a sheer delight from beginning to end. Kline is a marvel.
m/dave_chappelle_sticks_and_stones," Sticks and Stones is designed to generate inflammatory coverage... It's a symbiotic cycle with no end in sight, and it's become the last thing a beloved provocateur should ever want to be: predictable."
m/david_and_bathsheba, Entertaining less as a Bibilical epic than as an epic exercise in extreme camp.
m/david_and_layla," This is more suffering than should be asked of anyone to endure, but with admirable perversity, Jonroy decided to make a romantic comedy based on the love between an American Jew and a Kurdish Muslim woman whom the writer-director met in Paris."
m/david_cross_making_america_great_again," Are many of these jokes in horrible taste? Absolutely. Can Cross's comedy be difficult to watch? Yes, and not least because, you, like me, may find yourself guiltily chuckling at the punch lines."
m/davy_crockett_king_of_the_wild_frontier," Feature version of three TV Disney episodes still fun, exciting"
m/dawn_of_the_dead," Doesn't stop to take its breath, and it remains frequently scary in the moment without leaving much to chew on afterwards."
m/dawn_of_the_planet_of_the_apes," This vivid, violent extension of humanoid ape Caesar's troubled quest for independence bests its predecessor in nearly every technical and conceptual department ..."
m/dawn_patrol_2015," The opposite of enlightenment, the film hides its anxieties behind a mlange of third-rate grit and playful xenophobia."
m/day_after_tomorrow," Mother Nature is a *****, but another Ice Age would at least put sermonizing blockbuster filmmaking like this on deep freeze."
m/day_at_the_races," The Marx Brothers' second MGM movie (1937) has its moments, but the anarchy of the Paramount period was obviously gone forever."
m/day_for_night," A poem in praise of making movies. Not good movies, not bad movies -- movies."
m/day_night_day_night," This is a movie that's better left unexplained, since part of what is so breathtaking is Loktev's strength as a storyteller and Williams's expressiveness as an actor."
m/day_of_the_dead_bloodline_2018," If you're hungry for a good zombie homage to Romero's work, look no further than Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead. Bloodline is just plain rotten."
m/day_of_the_falcon," Ambitious but very tedious and talkatively hackneyed, redeemed just a smidge by the money shots of a swarm of extras on horseback sweeping across the sands."
m/day_of_the_flowers_2012," It's a likeable film, if not a particularly riveting one, easily enjoyed and just as easily forgotten."
m/day_of_the_jackal, Zinnemann's tale of an extremist faction's plot to kill the celebrated French leader and the authorities' efforts to capture the mercenary assassin hired for the job achieves a dignified tone and compelling pace seldom seen in latter-day thrillers.
m/day_of_the_locust, Accurately captures the intent of West's dark masterpiece.
m/day_of_the_outlaw," Harlan, best known for working with Howard Hawks and his work on To Kill a Mockingbird, magnificently captures what may very well be one of the best scenes from the 1950s."
m/day_the_earth_stood_still," The original 1951 film carried a timely anti-nuclear message, but this film wouldn't dare offend anyone by even mentioning the phrase ""global warming."""
m/day_watch," Bekmambetov mostly keeps his story moving forward on the back of his immensely likable protagonist, played by Konstantin Khabensky."
m/day_zero," This is not a watered-down take on what would happen if the men we know got drafted--it aims for the jugular. And hits it, hard."
m/daybreakers," Even if the premise turns out to be juicier than the payoff, this sci-fi/horror thriller suggests the Spierig brothers' future might be bright."
m/daydream_nation," To a large degree, the film is a platform for Dennings, with her young-but-wise blend of vulnerability and take-charge brashness that make her an utterly plausible magnet for sensitive dudes."
m/daylight," Though the explosion that seals off New York and New Jersey will have even curious theater concession stand crews bolting their posts, the characterizations are strictly low-cal."
m/daylight_2011," Barker leaves the histrionics to other thrill-makers, opting for the excruciating slow boil."
m/daylight_robbery," Tonally askew, comedically misjudged and drearily thuggish, this can be filed with any number of post-Lock, Stock caper comedies where psychopaths are portrayed as lovable geezers."
m/days_and_clouds, Elsa (Margherita Buy) and Michele (Antonio Albanese) have a problem: They're a married couple in a middlebrow arthouse movie.
m/days_and_nights_2013," The cast, so packed with talent that Jean Reno and Cherry Jones barely register, is stuck with stagey dialogue. Juliet Rylance, in the Nina part, has a particularly hard time."
m/days_of_glory_2007," Big budgeted ($16 million) multi-national production downplays its epic scale with a nicely-tuned ensemble that concentrates on personalities rather than battles, highlighting the contribution these men made despite treatment as second-class soldiers."
m/days_of_grace," This is genre filmmaking taken to its pulpiest extreme, an example of style over substance to be sure, but what style."
m/days_of_heaven," One thing that certainly can be said about Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven: it's not sentimental or manipulative. Unfortunately, it's also not particularly involving."
m/days_of_thunder, Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer have raised formula films to a science.
m/daytrippers," Unfortunately, to reveal that this funny family movie is bisexual actually will ruin the film for anyone who wants to see it."
m/dazed_and_confused," For a film like this, casting is everything, and the players are quite appealing."
m/dcu_justice_league_the_flashpoint_paradox," It's the butterfly effect as comic book apocalypse and it's a dark, brutal animated film."
m/ddongpari, Impressive first effort by the writer/director/producer/star this downbeat drama is sincere and authentic.
m/de_rouille_et_dos_2012," The entire picture feels like a poetic-grunge generality, with a penchant for jacked-up tension that feels applied to the situation, not pulled from within the people on screen."
m/de_sade," This awful attempt to do a movie biography of the Marquis de Sade falls flat, with embarrassing performances from all of the actors."
m/de_zaak_alzheimer, Van Looy has created a fast-paced and stylish thriller.
m/dead-man-running," It has a quality cast, but we've run round this track too many times, while the script jogs from scene to scene without any surprises."
m/dead-of-night-2009," a lazily-assembled greatest-hits collection of horror iconography stitched together with little depth, less purpose, and almost no entertainment value."
m/dead-or-alive," The tamest image in the movie is of a terrified man, about to be blown full of holes in a restaurant kitchen, who accidentally breads and deep-fries one of his hands."
m/dead_again," A film that is filled to the brim with energy, bravaura, and unbridled passion, a film that speaks only in broad strokes and leaves one feeling completely satisfied by its wild conclusion."
m/dead_alive," A gore classic featuring an ***-kicking priest, a grandmother swallowing a cat whole, a house full of zombies, and a lawnmower."
m/dead_and_buried," Dead and Buried isn't awful, but it's not good either."
m/dead_ant," An often insipid, mostly meandering horror/comedy hybrid that's too dumb to really recommend, but oddly endearing enough in the end to render it somewhat dopily palatable."
m/dead_awake_2017, This one-trick pony only paralyzes its victims for so long before succumbing to ghoulish paranormal norms.
m/dead_bang, Entirely standard cop fare. And Don Johson is the cop.
m/dead_calm, Edgy cinematography keeps the tension coming like waves.
m/dead_dicks," It's an uncommonly smart, engrossing and dramatically ambitious independent horror/drama."
m/dead_hooker_in_a_trunk," I think the Soska Sisters will ultimately prove to be better than this material. Not that the material isn't fun. But I note an artistic sensibility that will, with the proper financial nurturing, expand beyond the grindhouse."
m/dead_kids, This often compelling window into the boys' culture is muddied by overly slick stylization.
m/dead_man," A visual, poetic journey not unlike Coppola's Apocalypse Now."
m/dead_man_down_2013," Dead Man Down is unexpectedly good, smart and compelling even through its rougher patches"
m/dead_man_on_campus," This film is unendurable, but aside from that, it's also troubling."
m/dead_mans_burden_2013, A refreshing respite from filmmakers who believe the only low-budget option is to stay firmly ensconced in their own milieu.
m/dead_mans_shoes, The ending feels like a desperate attempt to inject some emotion into the film. And it just doesn't work.
m/dead_men_dont_wear_plaid, Mainly for the noir geeks and the Steve Martin fans -- and I'm both.
m/dead_night," While Baruh isn't strong with introductions, he's reasonably good with payoffs, generating a whirlwind of strangeness that saves the viewing experience."
m/dead_of_night_1974," Like the best genre films, Deathdream offers an interesting glimpse of the American psyche during the time it was made."
m/dead_of_winter," The movie itself is finally just an exercise in silliness -- great effort to little avail -- but the actors have fun with it, the sets work and there are one or two moments with perfect surprises."
m/dead_or_alive_final," Alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama, this smart-aleck movie ... tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life."
m/dead_poets_society," If you've done some living, every cockle of your heart will be touched"
m/dead_pool, A fine Dirty Harry film that features one of the best car chases of all time. And keep your eyes peeled for Jim Carrey's imitation of Axl Rose.
m/dead_ringers, Watching Ringers is not unlike watching a critical operation -- unnerving but also enthralling.
m/dead_silence," For those who like the little hairs to stand at fright attention on the back of the neck while gulping popcorn down the front, though, there's a new three-foot-tall creep in town."
m/dead_snow," It's all good in the name of grue, and there are some real doozies of death scenes which are equally horrifying, complex and comical."
m/dead_snow_2_red_vs_dead, Unabashed homage to Evil Dead 2 and movies like it. Sounds pretty awesome to me.
m/dead_water, A promising menage-a-trois at sea thriller that sinks more often than it swims
m/dead_zone," On the surface, THE DEAD ZONE looks like a very good film..."
m/deadfall_2012," The experience of watching the movie is not unlike a couple hours of channel surfing. That said, you're flipping between some pretty good shows."
m/deadline_2012," Although helmer Curt Hahn champions the causes of racial justice and crusading journalism, he can't seem to find a tone that's consistent or that befits the gravity of his subject matter."
m/deadpool," Ryan Reynolds, who played a misbegotten faux-Deadpool in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and has nobly spent the subsequent six years trying to atone by doing it right, may finally have found his defining role"
m/deadpool_2," True to form, Deadpool 2 doesn't skimp on one-liners and visual gags, many of them referencing signature moments in other movies... In a way, Deadpool 2 doesn't try to speak to the audience; it is the audience."
m/dealing_with_idiots," There's not much point in making a film about how different and dumb people are without giving the judgmental, one-man Greek chorus his own legitimate comeuppance."
m/dealt, Richard Turner's story is inspirational and makes you think about your life and shortcomings. This is the type of documentary that will make you feel alive while reminding the viewer to always live each day to the fullest.
m/dear-lemon-lima," Dear Lemon Lima is a quirky beauty of a film with its cotton-candy colors, Miranda July-esque sensibility, and its embracing of alienation as a source of creativity."
m/dear_diary," An ideal introduction to Moretti's work, this 1993 pseudo-documentary is weightier than it appears, a symbolic autobiography rather than a literal one."
m/dear_dictator_2018," A fun, breezy 90-minute sit starring actors who certainly aren't looking down on the material as they so easily could have."
m/dear_ex," The problems at the heart of Dear Ex takes moments to explain, but the film is more about the people than their problems. All of them are imperfect, biased human beings, but each contains resoundingly sympathetic and believable traits."
m/dear_frankie, Dear Frankie is a tender and touching family drama set in Glasgow.
m/dear_god," God, this thing is a total piece of junk. Even I'm embarrassed for You, and I'm an atheist."
m/dear_john," Nicholas Sparks writes the equivalent of comfort food, high-carb, low-nutrition, but sometimes it hits the spot."
m/dear_mr_watterson," Most people hold dearly to the memory of certain things they loved as kids, but those much-fingered scraps of security blanket aren't always enough to hold a documentary together."
m/dear_wendy," The film's highlight is the young cast's plausible turns, with the playful interactions among them proving particularly appealing. Their ensemble performances, however, can't even begin to approach remedying the nonsensical shortcomings."
m/dear_white_people," Simien's script is at its funniest when at its most confrontational, touching on a number of keen, pointed observations on the subtleties of racism."
m/death_and_the_maiden," The material is well served by director Roman Polanski, who knows well how to instill a subtle, claustrophobic sense of dread in an audience and has put together a rather elegant potboiler."
m/death_at_a_funeral," A crisp and clever hour and a half that, like the best screwball comedies, barely pauses for laughs."
m/death_at_a_funeral_2010," Isn't quite a success, although the cast does put forward their best effort."
m/death_becomes_her," In the self-obsessed world of Death Becomes Her, a world not too far removed from the real one, living well is not the best revenge, but a nip and a tuck may be."
m/death_by_china, Further confirmation that agitprop documentaries have become wedded to a template that undermines their very arguments.
m/death_defying_acts," As a slight and visually arresting little ""what if?"" tale, one that centers on a pop culture icon who still fascinates us today, Death Defying Acts is a perfectly passable period piece."
m/death_house," This strange, ambitious genre movie is notable for its huge cast of horror icons from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, but it's more horrifying than scary and not always good, though certainly interesting."
m/death_line, The first (or only?) ethnographic urban legend horror film.
m/death_note_2017," Dafoe absolutely devours the role and chews the surrounding scenery, but he is so entertaining that he only enhances the film."
m/death_of_a_cyclist, [Transposes] the ugliness of power relations in a repressive society to the spheres of sex and gossip.
m/death_of_a_president," It's a stunt more than a movie, and if this is what's passing for intelligent liberal thought in this (or any other) country, we're really in trouble."
m/death_proof," Tarantino has literally lost the plot, foregoing narrative drive for loquacious idling."
m/death_race," The movie makes no demands on its audience, except to cheer in all the right places."
m/death_race_2," Hey, action films like Inception only come around every once in a while. We have to watch something!"
m/death_race_2000," Corman didn't direct the drive-in hit Death Race 2000, but it bears his imprint of economic utilitarianism."
m/death_sentence, ...ultimately undone by a ridiculous final half hour in which Bacon turns into the Terminator.
m/death_to_smoochy, Impishly inventive little send-up of fear and loathing in kid-vid land.
m/death_wish," A compulsively watchable bit of '70s nostalgia, a curious counterpart to Dirty Harry and an icon of New York-brand justice."
m/death_wish_2018," This movie, a remake of the 1974 Charles Bronson film of the same name, is bad. But it's not the type of bad that's enjoyable or comedic - it takes itself too seriously for that."
m/death_wish_3," In short, this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical Charles Bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia."
m/death_wish_4_the_crackdown, more like a overtly violent after-school special rather than a cathartic vigilante movie
m/death_wish_ii," And now, the latest in our continuing series, 'Why The Hell Was This Sequel Made?'"
m/deathgasm," A star is born in Milo Cawthorne as headbangin' loner Brodie, who exhibits great comic timing and an every-dude charm, especially in his efforts to woo the wonderful Kimberley Crossman."
m/deathstroke_knights_and_dragons," An ungainly script brings Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons down, but its near-constant bloody action and focus on underserved characters help it to be a solid outing for Deathstroke and a nice change of pace for DC's animated line."
m/deathtrap, Offbeat parlor mystery that still holds up pretty well.
m/debs," The characters are two-dimensional parodies, trapped in a movie that doesn't know how to do parody. It's a good idea for a short, dragged out into a feature-length film."
m/debt_collectors," Action movies used to be all about this, the gritty scuffles and foot chases between characters who had opposing desires. It still works now although nobody had moves like Adkins in the '80s so it still feels bigger."
m/decasia," Bill Morrison's Decasia is uncompromising, difficult and unbearably beautiful."
m/deceiver, Explores some of the varied faces of lying and deception in our society from the inconsequential to the deeply harmful.
m/december_boys," Based on a novel by Michael Noonan, this sentimental tale of Australian orphans coming of age by the seaside has little to distinguish it except for the presence of Daniel Radcliffe."
m/deception_2008," Wolverines and Cougars aside, there are more than one strokes responsible for violating their own rules and putting a name on the film that is only an introduction to what's wrong with it."
m/deceptive_practice_the_mysteries_and_mentors_of_ricky_jay," Aside from some references to misdirection, Jay offers no clue as to how he pulls off illusions with sleight of hand, but he performs them with such panache that you have little choice but to suspend disbelief."
m/decision_before_dawn, The film manages to be suitably hard on the Nazi regime while providing one of the first sympathetic treatments of the German people.
m/deck_the_halls, The quintessential Hollywood Christmas movie. It's Grumpy Old Christmas.
m/declaration_of_war," [VIDEO] A new twist on the docudrama genre, ""Declaration of War"" is an affecting autobiographical story about a young French couple faced with caring for their 18-month son Adam after he's diagnosed with a brain tumor."
m/decoding_annie_parker," Tears are shed in ""Decoding Annie Parker,"" but they aren't accompanied by the kind of sad, misty soundtrack music that can leave you feeling used and abused. Instead of jerking tears, the movie edifies."
m/decoding_deepak_2012," A documentary following Deepak Chopra, a fireball of energy, creativity and spiritual vision, on the road for a year, filmed by his son."
m/deddo_sushi, The presence of Noboru Iguchi as director is enough to make it a must-see or avoid - by the standards of Japanese splatter it's a entertaining 90 mins of unrestrained insanity
m/dedication, Check it out and enjoy the hijinks of this messed up children's book writer but don't look that far into it because you will be disappointed.
m/deep, The Deep is an interesting action movie that manages to keep us at the edge of our seats for an hour and a half. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/deep_blue_sea_2," Deep Blue Sea 2 is a wet, coarse fin slap to the face of its far superior, and infinitely more fun original shark thriller."
m/deep_blue_sea_3," As opposed to other ""so-bad-they're-good"" shark films, this sequel draws viewers in with its genuineness and pays off with some truly jaw-dropping carnage."
m/deep_end, The gimmick that might have worked on serialized radio in the 1930's but not on the big screen today
m/deep_end_of_the_ocean, Michelle Pfeiffer turns in an impassioned performance of often gut-wrenching intensity in a film that deserves far less.
m/deep_impact," In Deep Impact, the impending disaster is a grabber: A colossal comet ""the size of New York City"" races toward Earth, and an E.L.E. -- an extinction-level event -- seems likely. So everybody might as well get their houses in order."
m/deep_red_1975," I don't think that Dario Argento, the director, meant to distance us from the action in this way. He's simply a director of incomparable incompetence."
m/deep_rising," The South China Sea's answer to the Bermuda Triangle, but off-the-shelf acting and a hackneyed plot won't keep this oversized barge afloat."
m/deep_sea_3d, Imax 3D underwater cinematography is so spectacular that it doesn't matter how well the films are assembled.
m/deep_web," Although it's a fascinating subject, the director doesn't bring much rigour or insight to the complexity of the case."
m/deepstar-six, A completely intolerable rip-off of THE ABYSS and about ten other movies.
m/deepwater_horizon," Nail-bitingly tense, even if it's frustratingly superficial."
m/deerskin, [A] hardly justifiable presence in a festival. [Full review in Spanish]
m/defamation, Shamir's propensity for scatterbrained journalism muddles the film's first half to the point of irritation.
m/defending_your_life," With Defending Your Life, Brooks has made his best, most fully realized film, a hysterical look at the afterlife."
m/defendor," Saving the day is Harrelson's low-key, rooted performance, adding an unexpected layer of poignancy when things take a decidedly darker turn."
m/defense_of_the_realm," There are marvelous performances by several British character actors, especially Denholm Elliott and Ian Bannen, and feelings of nerve-racking paranoia are evoked as a reporter, played by Gabriel Byrne, uncovers unexpected motives while investigating a Ca"
m/defiance_2008," A respectable shot at a Holocaust story with uplifting qualities and plump moral questioning, Defiance is a handsome production, just not an especially inspiring one."
m/defiant_ones," The Defiant Ones (1958) is a swift and exciting dramatic action-crime film, known for its symbolic and memorable image of two escaped convicts (Joker and Cullen), one white and one black. The two were tied together by 29 inch long shackles..."
m/deidra_and_laney_rob_a_train," Freeland's effort features some fun elements, a premise with potential and a pair of appealing performances from its leads."
m/deja_vu, A thoroughly intriguing mindblower of a techno-thriller.
m/delgo," Anything good that can be said about this movie tends to be hindered by the ugly animation, which pales in comparison to anything else being done in the field right now."
m/delhi-6," Maybe the runaway success of Slumdog Millionaire will inspire western audiences to sample more authentic Bollywood fare; with its first-rate music, world-class stars, and postcard-ready views of India, Delhi 6 presents an especially welcomin"
m/delhi_belly_2011, The most enjoyably subversive element is Poorna Jagannathan as the self-sufficient bachelorette who waylays Tashi on his way to the altar.
m/delhi_safari_2012, It shamelessly rips off much better animated movies. What kind of lesson is that for our young people?
m/deli_man," You will see better documentaries this year, but none more mouth-watering"
m/delicatessen," An amazing film, filled with amazing style, a wonderful off-beat tone, and some bits of satire which work with the film instead of being apart from it."
m/deliver_us_from_eva," As for Eva getting her groove back, well, aside from some ill-advised horseback riding, James Todd Smith proves a worthy match."
m/deliver_us_from_evil," The great tragedy underlying the story of Father O'Grady is how many children might not have been victims, had Cardinal Roger Mahoney ... been more interested in protecting the children residing in his diocese rather than furthering his own ascendancy wit"
m/deliver_us_from_evil_2014," A grisly thriller composed of talent on both sides of the camera, but the material rarely rises above lukewarm."
m/deliverance," There's real substance in themes, performances and John Boorman's superb direction."
m/delivery_man, Delivery Man is the worst kind of Hollywood garbage: a movie that sacrifices its star's greatest skills in order to score a middle-of-the-road hit that neither successfully explores its premise nor makes him look good.
m/delovely," Winkler and Cocks almost convince us that, despite his secrets, success and tortured later life, Porter is not interesting enough to warrant big-screen treatment."
m/delta_farce," By the time Larry wonders if they've ""mixed up our longitudes and our latitudes, our stalactites and our stalagmites,"" I think I could hear my brain cells screaming in agony."
m/delta_force, One has to question the excessive carnage of the finale and its celebration of the eye-for-an-eye ethic.
m/delta_force_2," This world, geographically located anywhere between Miami and Bogota, is full of lots of rotting cheese."
m/delta_of_venus, You need a decent script and quality actors to create something other than a series of soft-core fantasy vignettes.
m/dementia_13," Has some rep due to the director, but it's really pretty lame"
m/demolition_2016," This sort of storyline could go wrong very quickly, but thanks to some fortuitously funny moments, Vallee's assured direction and Gyllenhaal's spectacular performance it's surprisingly compelling"
m/demolition_man," Stallone is surprisingly good in this fast, funny and violent futuristic action film."
m/demon_2016," Demon is a smarter, more elegant brand of horror, one that wrestles with complicated, festering cultural conflicts that, in turn, advance the matters at hand."
m/demon_house_2018," Every time you think that things cannot get any stranger, the story keeps building and the tension keeps mounting... one of the single most compelling documentaries on the existence of the supernatural that I've ever witnessed."
m/demon_seed, Demon Seed builds to a lackluster third act that ensures it ends on as underwhelming a note that one could possibly envision...
m/demonlover," You might not like the succession of betrayals or the erotic diligence that is the backbone of the story, but there is command of the medium shown here."
m/demons_2_the_nightmare_returns," Doesn't even compare to the original, but the blood and guts make it passable entertainment."
m/den_of_thieves, Den of Thieves is a 90-minute thriller stretched out over a punishing two hours and twenty minutes.
m/denial_2016," A compelling, true courtroom drama touches on the lingering pain of the Holocaust."
m/denise_ho_becoming_the_song," I went into the film knowing nothing about the Cantopop star, and came away from it as an instant fan rejuvenated by my connection to every soul throughout the world currently fighting to preserve human rights against the rising tide of totalitarianism."
m/dennis_the_menace," Beyond the booby traps and plentiful pranks, Dennis the Menace is truly a treat for all ages."
m/departed," Uses a unique approach to expand on the original movie's clever double agent premise ... a really entertaining movie, but by no means a classic."
m/depraved," Depraved marks one of Fessenden's best films to date, showcasing the director's ability to craft a memorable, stylish and creatively astute narrative on a small budget."
m/der_kreis," The movie has the measured, dutiful quality of docudrama (and some on-the-nose dialogue). But it's a chapter in history well worth bringing to light."
m/der_samurai," A queer retelling of the werewolf myth, The Samurai reveals the dark side of a character who comes out in the light of the full moon wearing women's clothing rather than an animal's skin."
m/derailed," Despite a few plot holes, this is a well-acted, well-directed, well-written thriller that kept me interested throughout."
m/derailroaded," As with all great documentaries, Derailroaded challenges its audience to do some heavy soul-searching."
m/derrida," As an introduction to the man's theories and influence, Derrida is all but useless; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man, however, it's invaluable."
m/dersu_uzala, Every frame of Dersu Uzala is simply beautiful to look at. . . . Kurosawa's 140-minute masterpiece is a . . . quietly captivating experience.
m/descendants_2," Descendants 2 will not disappoint, and that means fans as well as Disney's number crunchers."
m/descent," Incrivelmente eficaz, este suspense mantém um clima de tensão e claustrofobia constante e ainda tem o mérito de investir em um elenco exclusivamente feminino."
m/desert_bayou," A fascinating and guardedly hopeful tale about race, class, religion and geography in American life."
m/desert_blue," A movie like this depends on tone more than anything else. Moviegoers who don't like the rhythm may grow impatient. It's not a romance, a drama or an adventure, but the evocation of a time and place. The characters are odd because they grew up that way."
m/desert_dancer," A little gem that sparkles brightly as it celebrates not just dance but unshackled, uncensored creative expression."
m/desert_hearts," Desert Hearts wasn't the first, but it's certainly one of the most significant and an important forebearer to Todd Haynes and Phyllis Nagy's sublime Carol."
m/desert_rats," Doesn't fare very well as a work of cinema, but if you take it as a fictionalised History channel documentary, you might find it compelling."
m/desierto_2016, Any perceptive dialogue or contemporary socio-political subtext is pummeled by Jonás Cuarón's preference for empty genre thrills.
m/designing_woman," This mildley entertaining comedy is a reworking of the superior Stevens' 1942 ""Woman of the Year,"" with Gregory Peck in the Spencer Tracy role and Lauren Bacall in Katharine Hepburn's."
m/desk_set," The least, perhaps, of the Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn collaborations...this 1957 comedy is nevertheless a bright and witty vehicle for its stars, directed well and anonymously by that fine old hack Walter Lang."
m/desperate_living," even by Waters' own admission, it is too grim and unsavory"
m/desperate_measures," The movie would rather jolly along an action audience than play fair with its material, and so we're treated to the standard obligatory bankrupt action dreck: kinetic energy on autopilot."
m/desperately_seeking_susan, Works despite Madonna and not really because of her.
m/despicable_me_2, A spot-on animated sequel that delivers the right balance of laughs and sentimentality ...
m/despicable_me_3," Have we seen better animated films? Without a doubt, yes. Have we seen a better film in the same franchise? Definitely. But that doesn't take away from the fact that this too is 1.5 hours of silly fun with a filling of marshmallowy niceness."
m/despite_the_falling_snow, There's not enough time to become the poignant love story it wants to be.
m/destination_wedding," A dark, bitter bonbon of an anti-romcom: so marvelously unromantic, so beautifully catty and witty. Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder were born to play these roles."
m/destiny_1924, It's hard to understand why this striking - and strikingly beautiful - silent epic isn't better known than it is.
m/destroy_all_monsters, That the special effects could have been more realistically concocted by a 12-year-old with a Super 8 camera only adds to the fun.
m/destroyer," Kidman herself, clearly one of the finest actors of her generation, or anyone else's. Kidman has fully absorbed Erin inside her, as there doesn't seem to be a point where the character ends and the actress begins."
m/destry_rides_again," Starring James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich, both in top form, this comedic-erotic Western was one of the most commercially popular films of 1939."
m/detachment," As odd as it may seem, monologues about progressive social issues serve the narrative well."
m/detective," Some of the content involving homosexuality now seems dated, but as a police procedural, it's a compelling watch."
m/detective_dee_and_the_mystery_of_the_phantom_flame, (Tsui Hark's) romp plays exactly like the Sino-centric spin on an Indiana Jones adventure that its title suggests it should.
m/detective_story_1951, Sidney Kingsley's hard-hitting Broadway drama about life in a big-town police station has been expertly filmed by William Wyler. The result is muscular entertainment for adults.
m/detention_2011," An overstuffed but ridiculously fun and gleefully original concoction. ""Detention"" should earn major ""cult hit"" status if for no other reason than for its fierce, unflinching juggling of genres and conventions."
m/detention_of_the_dead_2012," Detention Of The Dead isn't the best zombie movie ever (or even this year) or the best teen movie ever, but we've all seen worse examples of both genres, and as combinations go, it serves as diversion for the audience."
m/deterrence," In order to get into this film, one must suspend a truckload of disbelief."
m/detour," Detour, for those who have not seen it, may be the greatest achievement in B-movie making in history."
m/detour_2017," Even with three of the big screen's most dynamic up-and-comers at its center, there's no flesh and blood beneath all the posturing."
m/detroit_2017, Detroit is such a gripping and ultimately shattering piece of cinema that it merits seeing-albeit with a skeptical eye.
m/detroit_rock_city, Surprisingly amiable for a film that claims to 'kiss the rules goodbye.'
m/detropia_2012, A simultaneously surrealistic and sobering warning that the Motor City's host of woes might be coming soon to a town near you!
m/deuce_bigalow_male_gigolo," The good news is Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, an insufferably insipid comedy with a cruel subtext, is only 84 minutes long."
m/deuce_bigelow_european_gigolo," European Gigolo is more slapdash than its predecessor, and its jokes, albeit blue, are more borrowed than new."
m/deuces_wild," More nostalgic than realistic, Deuces Wild paints an unimaginative portrait of macho bullshit."
m/devil," Ultimately, the fact it's all down to the, um, Devil, means all the other characters' dark secrets that come to light are a bit pointless."
m/devil_and_miss_jones, Delightful comedy about low paid employees trying to organize a labor union.
m/devil_came_on_horseback," If you don't already have a handle on the complicated conflict at the heart of Darfur's ongoing genocide, you probably won't come away from this harrowing documentary with any comprehensive understanding."
m/devil_in_a_blue_dress," While Devil in a Blue Dress never develops the taut momentum of Franklin's previous effort, One False Move, it maintains audience involvement."
m/devils_advocate," High art this may not be, and certainly no Paradise Lost, but fine filmic entertainment it most definitely is."
m/devils_backbone," No se trata slo de una cinta de fantasmas sino de una narracin de atmsferas, de inquietud, de miedos confesados y otros no confesados..."
m/devils_brigade, There was doubtless stupidity on both sides during the war; there's certainly no lack of it in The Devil's Brigade.
m/devils_due," The found-footage genre means anyone can now make a horror film. Whether anyone will want to watch it is another issue. This one, allowing for Rosemary's Baby borrowings, is medium-crafty and well crafted."
m/devils_gate_2018, A very weak high concept thriller that gets worse the further it goes into its god awful premise.
m/devils_knot," Devil's Knot is sadly a CliffsNotes version of this case...that completely misses the outrage, injustice and severe breadth of how much investigative and prosecutorial mistakes severely bungled this case from its very first moments."
m/devils_on_the_doorstep," In its dry and forceful way, it delivers the same message as Jiri Menzel's Closely Watched Trains and Danis Tanovic's No Man's Land."
m/devils_own," The film should make it clear whether it considers the Brad Pitt character to be a hero or villain. My best guess is, he's a villain given a moral touch-up because he's also a movie star."
m/devils_rejects," A wild, grittily authentic, nihilistic jaw-dropper of a film!"
m/dhamma_brothers, Examines the before and after mindsets of hardened cons converted to an Eastern spiritual path.
m/dheepan," Like scrambled eggs or sex, messy can also be good, and Audiard's audacity and bravura filmmaking skills mean that though Dheepan has to break a lot of eggs, Audiard has created a tasty dish."
m/dhobi_ghat," With its key settings in a crowded, largely decrepit, congested yet beguiling, picturesque older portion of this city of 14 million inhabitants, the film is like a rich tapestry in which are interwoven the intersecting lives of three people."
m/dhoom_2," The pleasure principle is palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood."
m/diablo_2016," Diablo is an under-90-minute movie that feels doubly long, bringing you face-to-face with the Devil, but taking its sweet time to get there (unfortunately)."
m/dial_a_prayer," A rather touching portrait of a young woman's human growth, laced with a salutary number of small yet piquant observations along the way."
m/dial_m_for_murder," Critics seem to prefer the more theatrical, psychological melodramas to the brainy whodunits. But pay no attention - this film is definitely a classic"
m/diamonds_are_forever," No matter how crazy it all gets, it never stops entertaining."
m/diana_2013," An excruciatingly well-intentioned, reverential and sentimental biopic about her troubled final years, laced with bizarre cardboard dialogue - a tabloid fantasy of how famous and important people speak in private."
m/diana_kennedy_nothing_fancy," The joy of Elizabeth Carroll's new documentary...is how it balances these two aspects of her personality, perfectly illustrating her life-long love affair with Mexican cooking while embracing instead of downplaying her truculent coarseness."
m/diana_vreeland_the_eye_has_to_travel_2012," A fashion world Who's Who offer accolades, while Vreeland's vulnerabilities are revealed in interviews telling how, ridiculed by her socialite mother as ugly, she invented herself on her own terms."
m/diane_2019," This intelligent, wonderfully textured film deserves a wide audience."
m/diane_ii_2018, PTSD allegory of the ills that can haunt veterans... offer[s] an unusual take on both the murder mystery and the haunted house.
m/diary-of-the-dead2007," So yeah, it's a zombie flick crossed with the visual approach of The Blair Witch Project. But it's also quite a bit more than that."
m/diary_of_a_chambermaid," The themes of obsessive desire, inhibitions imposed by society and ridicule of conventional bourgeois values dominate Buuel's work, and Diary of a Chambermaid is no exception to that."
m/diary_of_a_lost_girl_1981, The Hollywood ideal corrupted by the deleterious social effects of the Third Reich remains one of the most haunting synergies in silent film.
m/diary_of_a_mad_black_woman, An awful hybrid of Big Momma's House and The Burning Bed - two films that go together like peanut butter and pubic lice.
m/diary_of_a_wimpy_kid," No better than a run-of-the-mill made-for-cable movie on any network that caters to pre-teens...[but] boys of a certain age--six to ten, perhaps--may enjoy [it]."
m/diary_of_a_wimpy_kid_2_rodrick_rules, A somewhat witty kids movie falls victim to sequelitis.
m/diary_of_a_wimpy_kid_dog_days," With each movie, the franchise becomes better at milking the formula that causes 4th graders to cringe with delight."
m/diary_of_a_wimpy_kid_the_long_haul, The entire appeal of a Wimpy Kid movie is in seeing that kid play off against those who aren't so wimpy.
m/diary_of_anne_frank, Represents Stevens at the height of his pretentiousness and the depths of his accomplishment.
m/diary_of_ellen_rimbauer," ""Diary"" isn't really scary or even creepy. And what's the use of a horror movie that isn't horrifying?"
m/dickie_roberts_former_child_star," Generally succeeds -- in hit-and-miss fashion -- at bridging the gap between unlikable jerk and misunderstood good guy, though it's still something of a leap to leading-man territory."
m/die_another_day," Sexy, funny and spectacular, Bond's first mission of the new millennium is one of the best of the series."
m/die_die_my_darling," If you like this sort of picture, it's worth seeing for Tallulah alone. She's terrific."
m/die_falschung_1981," The dramatically reconstructed battles are an example of good cinema, that is, of informative seriousness and creative imagination. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/die_hard, An ingenious and ceaselessly self-renewing thriller that surpasses every seeming limitation.
m/die_hard_2_1990," It's rambunctiously entertaining, a loop-de-loopy bumper car ride through a firecracker sky, all bright lights, sonic booms and impossible heroics."
m/die_hard_with_a_vengeance," Basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance."
m/die_wand," Introspective but rarely cerebral, The Wall is too frustratingly obtuse despite boasting a solid central performance and lush visuals."
m/dig, It basically boils down to: This is your band - this is your band%u2026 on drugs.
m/dig_two_graves_2017," less than totally coherent, and the style of the film puts too many obstacles in the viewer's path"
m/diggers, Manages to be entertaining while still engaging in an awful lot of soul searching.
m/digging_for_fire," The Seinfeld of this year's Sundance, basically a movie with a lot of talking about nothing."
m/digging_up_the_marrow," The results, less 'found footage' than - as Green calls it - 'footage footage', are a very funny, self-reflexive mash-up of documentary and fiction which focuses precisely on issues of belief, make believe, and the biting nature of reality."
m/dil_bole_hadippa," Ms. Mukherjee's enthusiasm is catchy, and when Veera delivers a feminist speech at the end, she's moving, too."
m/dilili_in_paris," It's absolutely astonishing to look at, a lovely visit to the City of Lights that quite literally glows... but the [English language] voice actors are all so wooden, they sound like the result of a translation program."
m/dim_sum_funeral," There were plenty of opportunities for originality here, but other than toying with a layer of Asian exoticism, writer Donald Martin doesn't stray far from convention"
m/diminished_capacity," An affectionate buddy road movie about baseball, elder belligerence, and uneasy male bonding between two odd couple mentally challenged guys. And while one appears to have simply lost his mind, the other can't seem to keep track of his."
m/diner," Diner is a naturalistically acted movie, but Rourke is so fluent with streetwise gesture and cool grace that he makes his costars look like the Three Stooges."
m/dinner_for_schmucks, Steve Carell finds a character more clueless than Michael Scott in broad laffer redeemed by occasional quirks.
m/dinner_game," It must be that I just don't get French humor, or at least not of the sort that attracts French movie-goers to theaters like bugs to bright lights."
m/dinner_with_friends," Norman Jewison's beautifully acted film is a tour de force with verbal fireworks, emotional surprises, and substantive insights into friendship, marriage, and divorce."
m/dinosaur_13," Fascinating story of the discovery of some T-Rex bones, sale of those bones and the battle over who owns them"
m/dinosaurs-alive, Putting something in large-format raises expectation of a sense of awe and wonder beyond the solid and well-taught information that alone that you could get on PBS.
m/dinotasia," If they're never fully convincing as photo-realistic figures, they're certainly as much good gory fun to watch as any old-school monster kids had to stick with dreary first acts to see."
m/dior_and_i, [I]t's an accomplished documentary that probably deserves more attention than just from the very niche audience it will find from film-fancy fashionistas.
m/diplomatie," To be sure, we are in that authorial fantasy by which historical figures become shrewder, sharper and wittier than they surely were in life... But when the actors and the dialogue are this good, one scarcely objects."
m/dirt_music_2019," [T]he corny, eventually rather contrived result doesn't end up doing justice to either its cast's talents or the quality of Winton's acclaimed prose."
m/dirty_dancing, The film's saving grace is that fully a third of the film has the actors dancing rather than talking.
m/dirty_dancing_2016," Dirty Dancing never quite feels like a fully realized film. It's too much of a copy cat and, honestly, it's like getting a torn up hand-me-down in comparison to the original."
m/dirty_dancing_havana_nights," At this rate, I only hope we're spared Dirty Dancing 3: Bosnia Bop."
m/dirty_dozen," The Dirty Dozen has always been highly regarded by both war movie fans and action fans alike. The movie's deeper thematic material is left in the subtext, allowing those who prefer to ignore it to do so comfortably."
m/dirty_girl_2011," Rocks fun characters, hilarious dialogue and an appropriate dose of emotion all wrapped up in a tight presentation packing the power to even bring a little bag of flour life."
m/dirty_grandpa," The film progressively gets worse the lower it sinks, and yet despite its indefensible badness, Dirty Grandpa is still marginally entertaining, if only because De Niro makes it so."
m/dirty_harry," The Dirty Harry films declined over the years, but the original's one worth seeking out."
m/dirty_mary_crazy_larry," While this may sound simplistic, there's more to the film than simple American Heist and Chase thriller, of the Dukes of Hazzard style."
m/dirty_pretty_things," This is strong stuff, but Frears avoids the soapbox by concentrating on the personal drama."
m/dirty_rotten_scoundrels, A very funny and entertaining film that should be recommended as an example of something that is rather absent in Hollywood these days -- stylish and well-crafted comedy.
m/dirty_shame," This NC-17 freak show could just as easily have been called All That MPAA Allows, and here it's plenty."
m/dirty_wars_2013," Dirty Wars leaves some deeper questions unexplored, mainly the philosophical struggle between security and secrecy, but makes up grandly with raw data and one correspondent's passion."
m/disappearance_at_clifton_hill," The deeper the film goes, the more it loses its grip."
m/disappearance_of_alice_creed," The film's behind-the-scenes hero is its cinematographer, Philipp Blaubach. His command of space and close-ups sustains all the tension visually that's sometimes dribbling out of the script."
m/disappearances," A frontier spirit and a strong connection to the landscape inform the piece, which aims not to wow but to immerse the viewer in a mystical, hardscrabble, bygone world."
m/disappearing_acts," But, while Lathan and Snipes have decent chemistry, the film never quite gets us to root for these characters enough to keep the story from edging consistently toward the tiresome."
m/disaster_movie," Seldom has a pic been more appropriately titled than Disaster Movie, yet another frantically unfunny free-form farce from the unfortunately prolific writing-directing team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer."
m/disclosure," Disclosure, ostensibly about reverse sexual harassment, is really just a platform for Moore's true lack of acting ability to come through better than ever."
m/disco_godfather, Call it whatever you want; I call it a schlock masterpiece.
m/disconnect_2013, ...a consistently compelling and surprisingly moving drama that remains a cut above similarly themed fare...
m/discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie," But though Buuel himself is gone, his films remain to skewer [the bourgeoisie] whenever we feel the urge to see them humiliated."
m/disgrace," It departs from conventional story structure and refuses to play much of anything safe, and while those are admirable (and too-rare) qualities, it also makes it a tough picture to connect and engage with."
m/dish," Thin mush that it is, Sitch's movie does know how to capitalize on cosmic awe."
m/disneynature_bears," Another typically engaging, vividly shot entry in the successful Disney wildlife series."
m/disneynature_chimpanzee, Chimpanzee gives us a fully smoothed-out story -- about an orphan ape named Oscar -- populated with chimps so cute and Disney-fied that you half expect them to break out in an Alan Menken song.
m/disneynature_crimson_wing," This one's a corker: the cinematography is exquisite; it's admirably devoid of any overt anthropomorphism; the narration, while a little too mythical in context, is informative."
m/disneynature_earth_2009, Stars Mother Nature and the photography deserve standing applause.
m/disneynature_monkey_kingdom," With its sumptuous photography, razor-sharp editing, and a delightfully comic narration by Tin Fey, ""Monkey Kingdom"" shows us like no other film in recent memory how closely animals act like people."
m/disneynature_oceans," This year, ""Earth Day"" (a day to ""inspire awareness and appreciation for the Earth's environment"") is marked by the release of ""Oceans,"" a lush documentary about the magnificent waters that cover more than 70 percent of the earth's surface, and the vast n"
m/disneys_aladdin, The jokes appeal to all levels of humor but the merriment is so constant that no tastes feel slighted.
m/disobedience_2017," At first it seems like a typical push-pull between tradition and modernity, but once we dig in with the characters, it has the crackle and sympathy of real life."
m/disorder_2016," It's hard to find a more vulnerable, volatile, and sensitive actor working today than [Matthias] Schoenaerts ... Here [Diane Kruger] exudes an elegance and coolness, not unlike Grace Kelly."
m/distorted," While the premise is mildly intriguing, the film's reliance on visual gimmickry never serves to establish consistent suspense before the whole thing runs off the rails in the incoherent final act."
m/district_13_ultimatum, An entertaining sequel with a political subtext that doesn't get in the way of the wall-to-wall action.
m/district_9," Neill Blomkamp's visceral and thumping debut presents a fascinating and effective vision of the future, and of humanity itself."
m/district_b13, One of the best adrenaline rushes since we saw Lola running for 90 minutes.
m/disturbia," Ironically, Disturbia's a thriller that doesn't want to bother you."
m/disturbing_behavior," Unlike Scream 2, which kids the horror cliches, Disturbing Behavior pretends they still hold power. But the movie is light on shocks and not ever scary."
m/disturbing_the_peace_2016, These determined optimists have their work cut out for them to reach a plurality that can bring some version of the two-state solution back to negotiations.
m/disturbing_the_peace_2020, Somehow manages to come across as both incredibly absurd and incredibly dull.
m/disturbing_the_universe, Particularly effective in showcasing the good Kunstler did for so many people and that tends to overpower all the bad stuff for which the majority probably remember Kunstler for later in his life.
m/divergent," Burger has surrounded Woodley with a sharp cast, including her ""Spectacular Now"" co-star Miles Teller, but everyone appears hemmed in by the recycled, humorless material."
m/divide_and_conquer_the_story_of_roger_ailes," Ailes was a monster, but it's worth spending time in his creepy orbit in order to try and understand him."
m/divided_we_fall," Confronts an incendiary topic head-on with grace, style, compassion and exquisitely practical wit."
m/divine_secrets_of_the_yaya_sisterhood," Smith, after a lifetime of roles that required nothing more than an upper-class sneer out of her, is a revelation."
m/divines," Divines isn't feminist. But it's thrillingly, fiercely female."
m/divorcee," Mesmo que supostamente denuncie o machismo da poca, o prprio filme  machista, moralista e repleto de personagens desprezveis, sendo verdadeiramente repugnante."
m/dixie_chicks_shut_up_and_sing, A rousing documentary that salutes freedom of speech and the resiliency and creativity of the Dixie Chicks.
m/django," I found it to be a wonderful junk film to nosh on between more nutritious films, if you may."
m/django_2018," This loose, intermittently compelling biopic of jazz great Django Reinhardt offers a much-deserved spotlight role for French actor Reda Kateb."
m/django_unchained_2012," Campy, funny, shocking, and seeping with sardonic social commentary, ""Django Unchained"" is Quentin Tarantino's finest film to date."
m/do_i_sound_gay, Another link in an increasingly tiresome chain of naval-gazing think pieces posing as personal documentary.
m/do_knot_disturb," A silly, contrived and often nauseating comedy with mildly engaging, visual stylish musical numbers. It often drags while the desperate attempts at humor fall flat on their face."
m/do_not_resist," One thing this documentary hints at, is that the United States is slowly becoming a militarized police state and that citizens are powerless to do anything about it."
m/do_the_right_thing, Has the greatness necessary to embrace its contradictions
m/do_you_believe, For anyone who likes intense drama & great performances
m/do_you_trust_this_computer," There's a lot to cram into 78 minutes. Director Chris Paine doesn't waste any time, so you'll need to pay attention."
m/doa_dead_or_alive," If Corey Yuen believed in truth in advertising, ala Snakes on a Plane, this flick would have a name like Jiggly Babes Kick Butt. The stuff that post-pubescent dreams are made of."
m/doc_hollywood," Overall disappointment, despite some sporadic laughs."
m/doctor_dolittle," [It] almost bankrupted the studio when audiences stayed away in droves. In retrospect, it's not hard to see why."
m/doctor_strange_2016," The acting, the visual fireworks and Michael Giacchino's distinctive, Eastern-influenced score all go a long way toward disguising the fact that we are once again watching an origin story, and one that seems even a bit more perfunctory than usual."
m/dodgeball_a_true_underdog_story, I actually found myself laughing quite a bit during 'Dodgeball' - more than enough times to recommend it to anyone in a silly sort of mood.
m/dodsworth," The film version has done more than justice to Mr. Howard's play, converting a necessarily episodic tale, interrupted by fourteen curtains, into a smooth-flowing narrative of sustained interest, well-defined performance and good talk."
m/dog_day_afternoon, Lumet channels Pacino's relentless energy into a sustained and blackly comic study of hopeless desperation.
m/dog_days_2018," Marino keeps the feature as unthreatening as possible, with as many tongue-flapping canine close-ups as possible, and he's capable of so much more than this lethargic sameness."
m/dog_eat_dog_2016," Dog Eat Dog will not be for everybody, it's unforgiving in its commitment to violence and unconventional in its means of storytelling."
m/dog_pound_2010," Covers predictable ground with admirable sincerity and is notable for some eye-catching performances, not least that of Adam Butcher as an angry young man."
m/dog_soldiers," Sam Raimi may be done with the Evil Dead series, but there are plenty of acolytes around to pick up the slack, among them first-time helmer Neil Marshall."
m/doghouse," A grotesque misogynistic romp, Doghouse is too laddish and corny to even hold a candle to the witty Shaun Of The Dead. Perhaps Lesbian Vampire Killers wasn't so bad after all."
m/dogtooth," A black-comic poem of dysfunction, a veritable operetta of self-harm, this brilliant and bizarre film from the Greek director Giorgos Lanthimos is superbly acted and icily controlled -- it grips from the very first scenes."
m/dogtown_and_zboys," The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture, the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative (and sometimes illegal) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults."
m/dogville," Savage and compelling, even if von Trier's political ends (this being the first in a proposed trilogy about America) are too murky and caustic for the film to seem fully realized."
m/doin_it_in_the_park_pick_up_basketball_nyc_2012," Daunting though it may be for the aspiring pick-up entrant, this is a fun and worthwhile ode to one of New York's greatest summer pastimes."
m/dolce_vita," Fellini's best film, in which the fragility of the characters is not overwhelmed by the director's decadent indulgences."
m/dolemite," For whatever it lacks formally, Dolemite is a fun, fascinating piece of cultural history."
m/dolemite_is_my_name," Dolemite Is My Name is often quite fun, and it celebrates a spirit in which will-do perseveres even in an absence of can-do."
m/dolittle," Robert Downey Jr. turns in a bizarre, but entertaining performance in Dolittle, though it doesn't much elevate this generic family-friendly adventure."
m/dollars," Beatty and Hawn carry this fun little heist/comedy picture for the first hour, but then the whole affair gets a little tiring."
m/dolly_partons_coat_of_many_colors," To paraphrase something Parton once said about herself: It may look fake, but it's real where it counts. What counts most is the acting, which lends the story a naturalism that the script can't."
m/dolores_claiborne, The film ... lacks tension and suspense - or even enough compelling emotion to make for a satisfactory thriller or melodrama.
m/dolphin_tale," ""Dolphin Tale"" is a sweet children's movie. There are no big explosions, rude humor, or green-eyed monsters -- just a heartwarming true story about people who care for one very special dolphin."
m/dolphin_tale_2, This sequel should entertain the youngsters while not boring and certainly not annoying any parents or other adults accompanying them. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)
m/dolphins, Dolphins will undoubtedly send the little ones to the snack bar. Older children will feel as though they've seen this all before
m/dom_hemingway," Mixing two parts Irvine Welsh, one part Bronson, a few dashes of perversity, all wrapped in a blanket of excess, Jude Law takes that bundle, bites heartily into the role of Dom, chews it up, swallows and pisses it right back out with glee."
m/domain_2018, Atcheson has found a clever way to tell a lot of story without many resources - although the end result is still more exhausting than enticing.
m/domestic_disturbance," There are some nifty Hitchcock-style opening credits, but after that, it's downhill."
m/dominick_dunne_after_the_party," Jolley and de Garis never come close to revealing whatever lurks in the heart of this intelligent, ambitious, plainly unhappy and not particularly admirable man, who bears scars from many wounds, not all of them self-inflicted."
m/dominion_prequel_to_the_exorcist," Dominion is indeed a plodfest, and though it's not as garish as Mr. Harlin's version, it's way too dire for its own good."
m/domino," A challenging, complicated and hilarious heist thriller"
m/domino_2019, Here's hoping that the director has at least one more great film in him before deciding to hang it up forever. I would hate for a career as brilliant as his to end on this sour a note.
m/don-juan-demarco," Brando doesn't so much walk through this movie as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with."
m/don_2," Director Farhan Akhtar shoots and cuts the action awkwardly, not quite knowing where to place the camera, so the film never gets the slam-bang momentum it might want."
m/don_jon," Often light on its feet, bolstered by the reliable charms and writing chops of its leading man."
m/don_mckay, A squirmy-funny exercise in oddness that happily takes its time getting to the truth...Church hasn't had many roles as juicy as the title character of Don McKay.
m/don_peyote," You feel as if, at any moment, anything could happen. The problem is, seemingly everything does."
m/don_quixote_1992," [Jess] Franco's version is not even an approximation, never mind a reconstruction.... But even as a visual record of Welles' raw footage it's a travesty."
m/don_verdean," No one is spared the righteous comic wrath of the director Jared Hess, in this wild satire about the exploitation of Christian faith by Christians and others."
m/donkey_punch, By Doug Cooper - Donkey is good enough to stand on its own two feet without the aid of the muckracking which the film-makers have not discouraged.
m/donnie_brasco," Takes us into a world that the movies frequently open to us, but somehow this trip seems more real and less glamorized than most."
m/donnie_darko," ... a coming-of-age, romantic, black comedy about time traveling, has an undeniable charm that's hard to properly describe."
m/donnybrook," A repellent mixture of Malick-like dreaminess, Scorsese-esque brutality and the lurid shock/schlock of William Faulkner in Sanctuary mode."
m/donovans_echo," Greenwood is excellent, as always. And a carefully measured performance by Sonja Bennett as Maggie's confused, protective mother contributes to a sense of stampeding panic."
m/donovans_reef, Brilliant John Ford comedy with serious commentary on racism
m/dont_be_a_menace," The thin plot is merely the frame for gags, and there are more a few good ones here."
m/dont_be_afraid_of_the_dark_2011," 'Dark 'is an engaging, well-paced and scary horror film... it's a gateway horror flick, one that will push the younger generation into our sick and twisted world."
m/dont_be_nice, A documentary that reveals the power of poetry to speak truth to power.
m/dont_bother_to_knock," Drama realizado para provar que Monroe era boa atriz,  at bem sucedido em certo grau, pois ela desempenha razoavelmente bem seu papel. O problema  que o roteiro no desenvolve muito a histria, que parece ter sido escrita para teatro."
m/dont_breathe_2016," Don't Breathe makes for a very fun little thriller, though it also veers into being exceptionally stupid or eye-rollingly gross."
m/dont_call_me_son," Muylaert handles an atmosphere charged with intensely conflicting expectations with a light touch, and sparks of humour. The slight running time belies the emotional depth of Don't Call Me Son."
m/dont_come_back_from_the_moon," ... Moon is an unexpected meditation on the complicated nature of family & how our grief can lead to depression, causing ourselves to come up with a myriad of reasons to leave ..."
m/dont_come_knocking," A dry, spare, odd and oddly satisfying drama about a modern-day lonesome cowboy, lost in a desert of his own making, who seeks salvation by searching out those he left behind."
m/dont_go_2018, Effective atmospherics don't fully compensate for the sluggish storytelling.
m/dont_go_in_the_house," Looks at a man damaged by the psychopathy of his mother, and also encapsulates the '70s fading in the rear-view while 1980 reared its head."
m/dont_hang_up_2017," Even if the game-playing manipulation of 'Mr Lee' seems familiar from many other films, it is presented with real craft - and the moral commentary on the disconnect between online activity and real-world repercussion is very much of the now."
m/dont_kill_it," Mendez returns to form with ""Don't Kill It,"" a wild and inventive comedic chiller."
m/dont_knock_twice, Watch carefully. Katee Sackhoff's performance in Don't Knock Twice is a silent cry to find projects worthy of her.
m/dont_leave_home," While this twisty tale of an ""evil miracle"" connected to a self-exiled former priest ultimately withholds too much to resolve all of its enigmas, the atmospheric mood and persuasive performances keep you watching."
m/dont_let_go_2019," It's super suspenseful because we already know the future. When the past catches up, we're trying to figure out what can possibly change this time."
m/dont_look_back_1967, Easily one of the best documentaries on any subject ever made. It is also one of the most cinematically influential.
m/dont_look_now," A haunting, beautiful labyrinth that gets inside your bones and stays there."
m/dont_mess_with_texas_2014," I am tempted to say it's another sorry example of what women have to do to keep an acting career going today, when all the juicy roles go to men. Unfortunately they have only themselves to blame. They are both listed in the credits as executive producers."
m/dont_say_a_word, It was a well-made thriller with a lot of tense moments and cleverly conceived situations.
m/dont_stop_believin_everymans_journey, Everyman's Journey is a fun and occasionally inspiring look at a man given the chance to live his dreams that you can sing along with
m/dont_tell_mom_the_babysitters_dead, The souls of these little monsters are much too black to be redeemed within the confines of an hour and a half film.
m/dont_think_twice, The imperfections of Don't Think Twice are fitting for a movie about artistic expression that's never quite finished.
m/dont_torture_a_duckling, The signature Fulci bit is also a devastating culmination of the film's autopsy of corrupt patriarchy
m/dont_worry_he_wont_get_far_on_foot, This unwieldy but consistently enjoyable portrait of paraplegic local hero John Callahan is notable for its generosity of spirit and gentleness.
m/doom," High art and smart sci-fi it is not, but you have to hand it to a film that plays its cards right, lays everything out on the table, and goes for broke."
m/doom_annihilation, Despite its low budget it's bound to satisfy more fans of the historic video game than that Dwayne Johnson film ever did.
m/doom_generation, The violence becomes commonplace. The crudities never end. But there are hip benefits for staying to watch.
m/doomsday," Doomsday typifies the kind of movie that gets dumped into theaters during the late winter -- a regurgitated storyline, no big stars, and no real prospects at the box office."
m/doomsday_book," sandwiching Kim Ji-woon's serious and savoury speculative fiction between Yim Pil-sung's two altogether more absurdist slices of Armageddon, these three stories are concerned as much with renewal as with destruction."
m/doors," The film is an absurdity -- muddled, self-serious, alienating, a stone drag."
m/dopamine," A creative, intelligent, romantic film that asks, 'Is love just a chemical reaction?'"
m/dope_2015, A funny and often intelligent crowd-pleaser about three geeks who get smart about drug-dealing.
m/dora_and_the_lost_city_of_gold, Dora and the Lost City of Gold fully embraces the source material. Kids will howl with laughter. They're the target audience and will be thoroughly entertained.
m/dorfman_in_love, Forced and unfunny portrait of a Young Woman as a Loser.
m/dormant_beauty, The Vesuvius of social-psychological potboilers. All the screaming and twice the anguish of the average Italian movie.
m/dot_the_i," While the plot whirls around with a number of deft twists and deepens into darker layers, the story is emotionally uninvolving."
m/double_dare, With this documentary director Amanda Micheli follows the lives of two film stuntwomen. She covers their professional and personal lives and the profession.
m/double_dragon, An incoherent children's adventure based on a popular video game.
m/double_impact," Some decent hand-to-hand (or, rather, foot-to-foot) combat, too many dull shootouts, and dopey dialogue that sounds even dopier coming from Van Damme."
m/double_indemnity," A splendidly chilling noir tale about murder, immorality, lust, and greed."
m/double_life_of_veronique," While this is the film that set the stage aesthetically for Kieslowski's masterful Three Colors trilogy, it is more mysterious than any of those films."
m/double_lover, Ozon's film has the appropriately sleazy touch of camp and bat-shit wonky direction to become a cult twin-thriller.
m/double_team, Van Damme was better in such earlier films as Timecop and Sudden Death because he had more to do: Here he's at the mercy of the jam-packed plot.
m/double_whammy," Tries too hard, forcing off-the-wall dialogue where it doesn't belong."
m/doubt," Doubt stirs up a lot of stormy theatrical weather, but the stolid transfer from stage to screen does Shanley's play no favors."
m/dougs_1st_movie," There's enough quirky charm, light-hearted humor and fresh ideas to appeal to both younger children, eager to grow up, and to older viewers looking back on the dawn of their own awkward adolescence."
m/dovlatov," Maric, in his first lead role, exudes gentility with physical strength."
m/down-terrace," When it's good, it's hilarious, shocking and weirdly plausible."
m/down_a_dark_hall, An atmospheric and terrifying exercise in juvenile sadomasochism. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/down_and_derby, The cartoonish movie might have made for a funny half-hour short or sitcom pilot but runs out of track well before its conclusion.
m/down_and_out_in_beverly_hills, Let me just say that Down and Out in Beverly Hills made me laugh longer and louder than any film I've seen in a long time.
m/down_by_law," Its soul is the same as all Jarmusch films, but here he digs a bit deeper into the roots of his own methodology and that to which he is opposed."
m/down_in_the_delta, Year after year in film after film I've seen Alfre Woodard at work. She is on that very short list of people who rarely seem to appear in anything unworthy.
m/down_in_the_valley," Imperfect and overlong, but hugely ambitious and often breathtaking."
m/down_periscope," A soggy sub sandwich layered with cheesy action, stale jokes and gung-ho baloney."
m/down_the_shore, The virtue of this standard family tale is James Gandolfini's most substantial feature role to date.
m/down_to_the_bone," Whether you're ready for the ride depends on whether you're looking for traditional filmic fare, or whether you're in the mood to be dragged into the depths of depression."
m/down_to_you," Down to You has cute boys, cute girls and little else."
m/down_with_love," In the spirit of the film's buoyant campiness, may I say, up with Down With Love?"
m/downfall," Hitler's final days are brought to horrifying life in Downfall, a movie that's not a whole lot of fun, but commands one's unflinching attention for 150 straight minutes"
m/downhill_racer," The location skiing sequences, revealing Ritchie's background and interest in documentary styles, are simply astounding, even for those with little interest in the sport."
m/downriver," A rather drab and listless mood piece that, despite best efforts of cast and crew, will serve as a prime example for anybody arguing this sort of drama has been dragged down the river too many times before."
m/downsizing, A science fiction fable much less naif than it seems. [Full review in Spanish]
m/downton_abbey," There are a few hilariously under-sketched twists but, all in all, it's a bravura feat of storytelling akin to a Georgian-era Avengers: Infinity War."
m/downtown_81," Basquiat himself is handsome but vapid, a sounding board for philosophical drivel that gives tortured, penniless artists a bad name."
m/dr_bronners_magic_soapbox," You know there's a story behind Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap, and filmmaker Sara Lamm hopes you're interested in hearing it. Luckily the story behind the suds is a pretty good one."
m/dr_cyclops," Beautifully crafted trash that should appeal to all lovers of sci-fi, horror and cult cinema."
m/dr_dolittle," Doctor Doolittle seems to have borrowed the idea from the execrable Theodore Rex that if your anthropomorphic creature can't say anything interesting, you should just keep him talking fast in the hope no one will notice."
m/dr_dolittle_2," Without question, Dolittle 2 does entertain, but it just doesn't have enough heart and hardiness to let slide its deficiencies."
m/dr_feelgood_dealer_or_healer, Compassionate yet well-balanced and highly human documentary about pain-management physician William Hurwitz.
m/dr_giggles, The numbing familiarity of everything in the film just makes the cartoonish bits look ridiculous.
m/dr_goldfoot_and_the_bikini_machine," Pretty darn stupid, which is not at all an impediment to it being a terrific lot of fun."
m/dr_mabuse_the_gambler, Plays like the stream of a not very pleasant consciousness.
m/dr_no, Dr. No introduces James Bond to the world in a down-to-earth way. The classic touches are here
m/dr_phibes_rises_again," ...falls prey to the familiar Curse of the Sequel -- it's a noticeably lesser, lazier work."
m/dr_strangelove, The film is a model of barely controlled hysteria in which the absurdity of hypermasculine Cold War posturing becomes devastatingly funny--and at the same time nightmarishly frightening in its accuracy.
m/dr_t_and_the_women," Despite yielding to lots of interesting analysis, it is, in the end, minor work at best."
m/dr_who_and_the_daleks," The biggest problem with these scenes is that few of the actors seem properly scared, a factor perhaps influenced by censors who, at the time, had to be patiently persuaded that the film would not be too frightening for children."
m/dracula_2000, Enough cheap scares for pretty much anyone looking for some enjoyable bloody fun.
m/dracula_ad_1972," Dracula A.D. 1972 isn't a great movie. But it is an undeniable hoot to watch especially if, like the Count, ""you've got an eye for London's hot pants... "" And who doesn't, really?"
m/dracula_dead_and_loving_it," Sadly, Brooks manages to hack it up like he did to poor Robin Hood, thanks to some very stale jokes and overly repetitious gags."
m/dracula_has_risen_from_the_grave, Christopher Lee's death-by-crucifix ending stands as one of the most iconic gothic images ever recorded in cinematic vampire lore.
m/dracula_untold, The cast sink their teeth in but the resulting film is surprisingly bloodless.
m/draculas_daughter," Although it is a marked improvement on the original film, it's still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright."
m/draft_day," Even people who aren't football fans will appreciate the maneuvers and the high-stakes trading, the make-or-break strategies and the careers in the balance."
m/drag_me_to_hell," [The] brand-new self-described ""spook-a-blast"" is a nasty little bit of cyanide fun, a new Sam Raimi horror film, and it is an indecent amount of fun."
m/dragged_across_concrete," Brilliantly surreal set design pulls you into this heightened reality, from a police station in a high rise to a desolate bank that looks like it's from the future."
m/dragon_and_the_hawk, An amateur production keeps you from getting caught up in the movie
m/dragon_ball_super_broly, Everything is a long prologue to reach the characteristic Dragon Ball climax: a combat... The surviving parents of that battle can feel proud for having passed another test of love for their children. [Full review in Spanish]
m/dragon_blade," An unparalleled meeting of Eastern and Western talent, writer-director Daniel Lee's historical blockbuster is entertainment on a grand scale."
m/dragon_the_bruce_lee_story, The engaging dramatic biography celebrates Bruce Lee's spirit using a rough outline of his career as a narrative guide.
m/dragon_wars," America does just fine making cringingly terrible special-effect extravaganzas, so back off, South Korea!"
m/dragonball, Puerile childrens' sci-fi of a strictly B-movie standard.
m/dragonheart, Exciting fantasy flick has Connery voicing the dragon.
m/dragonslayer," In today's glut of so-called ""effects films"" featuring all CGI and no story, Dragonslayer is a reminder that a balance between the two is indeed possible."
m/dragonslayer_2011," Departing from the conventions of documentary portraiture, ""Dragonslayer"" delivers the cinematic equivalent punk rock candy."
m/dream_a_little_dream," This is one incoherent movie; I have a hunch that the writers could not figure it out, either."
m/dream_big_engineering_our_world, Entertaining but almost too ambitious for its own sake ...
m/dream_for_an_insomniac," A romantic comedy about bright, funny, confused young people in San Francisco, it fails to be bright or funny itself, only confused."
m/dream_home_2010," Pang's film may be heavy-fisted with the satire and foggily plotted, too, despite the lengthy flashbacks, but no one could doubt his commitment to the death rattle."
m/dream_house_2011, Dream House crossed a new line. It literally lays out every plot twist in the first 80 minutes of the movie during the main theatrical trailer.
m/dreamcatcher," Even the shoddiest of cliffnote 'authors' would be embarrassed over condensing a novel down to this elementary a form. Everything seems to work, but it's all too abbreviated to draw the audience in."
m/dreamer," Dreamer does hoe some pretty familiar turf, but thankfully it doesn't husk too much corn."
m/dreamgirls, The thing that really sticks with you about the Dreamgirls experience is that there is a real joy of performance and show business and artistry.
m/dreaming_of_joseph_lees," Most of the performances seem a bit thin and miscast, inspiring me to wonder what this film might've been like with different actors."
m/dreamland_2020," while its hard-boiled escapades can be enjoyed even by those who know nothing about Pontypool, Dreamland offers the nichest (also richest) of pleasures to the already niche audience of those who know & love McDonald & Burgess' previous collaboration"
m/dreams_1990," It's something altogether new for Kurosawa, a collection of short, sometimes fragmentary films that are less like dreams than fairy tales of past, present and future. The magical and mysterious are mixed with the practical, funny and polemical."
m/dreams_of_a_life, The problem - and it's a glaring one - is that Morley imposes a creative stamp on the material that keeps getting in the way.
m/dreams_rewired, The film really serves as a tribute to the then newfangled phenomenon of moving pictures ... Its most persuasive (and unspoken) revelation is that filmmaking evolved concurrently in the Old World as it did in the United States.
m/dreams_with_sharp_teeth," Harlan Ellison is a mook, but he won't begrudge you for calling him that."
m/dreamscape," A perfect pick if you've got a flick-addicted 14-year-old boy at home, and a fun genre flick for the whole family, Dreamscape is a little bit scary, a little bit smart, and a whole lotta B-movie fun."
m/dredd," Dredd hits that perfect sweet spot of filmmakers isolating an audience and totally serving that audience. I hope sci-fi fans will appreciate this as a throwback, an homage or just damn awesome."
m/dresser, Gives a wonderful behind-the-scenes look at the theatre business
m/drew_the_man_behind_the_poster," The demure, self-effacing Struzan undermines Sharkey's strategy by insisting his art is only the product of a mundane creative process."
m/drift_2013," The film could very easily have devolved into a cornball family drama/sports soap opera, but it remains both steadfastly likable and quietly compelling throughout."
m/drifter_2017, Drifter showcases the talents of a confident director...
m/drillbit_taylor, A dispiritingly mediocre tweener comedy from some very talented people who appear to be experiencing a delayed sophomore slump.
m/drinking_buddies_2013," The film stays true to Swanberg's roots, even if it means making a wispy little slip of a movie that indulgent audiences will not have to get blackout drunk to forget."
m/drive-angry, A raunchy throwback to old-school 70s and 80s exploitation movies. Cage isn't at his most manic this time (more's the pity) but he still burns up the road.
m/drive_2011," At least half a dozen scenes are burned into my memory for life, including not one but two of the most jarring, heartbreaking juxtapositions of tenderness and violence this side of classic Kitano."
m/drive_2019," No scene or subplot in Drive has any reason to exist, but still, it continues to labour on."
m/drive_hard," without films like this, cable TV would have nothing to show at 2 AM"
m/drive_he_said," A disorganized but occasionally brilliant movie about two college students and the world they, and we, inhabit."
m/drive_me_crazy," solid acting and dialogue, but no unpredictable twists."
m/driven," It's a perfectly cromulent crime-doesn't-pay narrative, elevated slightly by director Hamm's unapologetic love of period kitsch and engaging performances from Sudeikis, Judy Greer and Corey Stoll."
m/driven_2020," Roger may be the passenger, but this is ultimately Emerson's journey, as she learns to overcome her own demons and take control of the wheel. The resulting ride, too low-key to be called wild exactly, is nonetheless funny and strange."
m/driverx, ... never establishes a sufficient emotional foothold to make it insightful or dramatically compelling.
m/driveways," There's no drama or even melodrama here. Instead, this is just a small and very human piece, anchored around small and very human moments."
m/drone_2017, The topicality and moral complexity in this thriller about intelligence leaks and the war on terror is undermined by its preposterous plot twists.
m/drones_2013," When horror movies and history meet. And with a disturbing and discomforting persistent dread, Drones is in no way standard entertainment, nor should it be. Or as Dirty Wars doc director Jeremy Scahill solemnly observed, 'You can't surrender to a drone.'"
m/drop_dead_fred, Drop Dead Fred gives imaginary friends everywhere a bad name; one only hopes that there is an Imaginary Friend Defamation League.
m/drop_dead_gorgeous," Drop Dead Gorgeous doesn't drop dead, but the gags often arrive like planks hitting our heads."
m/drowning_mona," Mona, a screenplay dripping with contempt, gives its cast enough rope and enough bad jokes to make you feel seriously sorry for all of them."
m/drowning_pool," Dullish detective yarn that promises a great deal more than it delivers in story, direction or atmosphere."
m/drug_lord_the_legend_of_shorty_2014," Save for the vague aura of danger surrounding Guzmn, Drug Lord has trouble forming a coherent point of view."
m/drug_war_2013," Drug War is an absorbing, exciting film, and the work of a profoundly assured craftsman."
m/drugstore_cowboy, communicates its anti-drug message with a sense of humor and humanity
m/drumline, The symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees. I wanted more.
m/drums_along_the_mohawk, It was Ford's first film in color and contains at least a handful of his most beautifully composed moments.
m/drunk_parents," Unfunny dark comedy leans on cursing, molestation jokes."
m/drunk_stoned_brilliant_dead_the_story_of_the_national_lampoon," Whether you're familiar with the Lampoon magazine or just a fan of comedy in general, this is a thoroughly enlightening and entertaining homework assignment."
m/drunkboat," In the end, ""Drunkboat"" is no ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" or ""American Buffalo,"" and even if it were, the real Mamet has always worked better onstage than on film."
m/drunken_master, It shows why Chan deserved to become a world-class star. [Full review in Spanish]
m/drunks, Drunks succeeds in presenting a fictional AA meeting and getting across the idea that alcoholics come from all walks of life...
m/dry_land," If we'd wanted a sermon, we'd have gone to church, thanks."
m/dtf," There's a definite [watching a] car crash element to it... But I'm not I learned anything, aside from a fear of flying."
m/duane_hopwood, Writer-director Matt Mulhern confidently anchors his drama-comedy about an alcoholic Atlantic City pit boss with good writing and sharp dialogue.
m/duck," Buried somewhere in this messy, strange and occasionally affecting film is an interesting idea -- perhaps even a good one. But what's on screen in DUCK also veers into territory that is precious and even boring."
m/duck_butter_2018," In scope, it's a modest movie (and purposefully so), but the relationships and impulses it portrays are anything but minor."
m/duck_season_2006," Despite its tiny canvas, Duck Season soars with all the profundity and inanity of teenage life; the tenderness, the isolation, and the doomed joy of its innocent irresponsibility."
m/duck_soup," A masterpiece. Fast-moving, irreverent, almost anarchic in style, Duck Soup is considered by many to be the Marx Brothers's greatest achievement..."
m/duck_you_sucker," Features one of the most glorious and unforgettable scores by Leone's composer, Ennio Morricone."
m/ducktales-the-movie, I was pleasantly surprised at how clever and funny the film is.
m/dude_bro_party_massacre_iii," Moments of hilarity remain, and the picture is inventive in its adoration for the excesses of the genre and the world of VHS recording."
m/dude_wheres_my_car," Following these two clumsy, unpretentious doofuses as they jump from one brisk gag to another is a gentle, cozy experience, especially if you compare these harmless vignettes to the brutal and vitriolic spirit of, say, a comedy by the Farrelly brothers."
m/dudley_doright, When will Hollywood learn that successful animated concepts just don't cut it when translated to flesh-and blood life?
m/due-date," Due Date may not be nearly as clever as The Hangover, but it's a fairly satisfying film on its own merits, a fun experience that's more than just an endless stream of jokes."
m/duellists," The Duellists registers on the senses like a pointillist work of art, encouraging us to revel in its symmetry and relish its high regard for small details."
m/dukes, It's an enjoyable way to pass 90 minutes. But to call it an important movie with big ideas is like saying Miley Cyrus sings like Ella Fitzgerald.
m/dukes_of_hazzard," The Dukes of Hazzard is the latest evidence that, for Hollywood studios at least, there can never be too much of a mediocre thing."
m/dum_maaro_dum," Dum Maaro Dum has a story with the right mix for a thriller, and takes off the mark unerringly, lining up all its ducks in a smart, stylish row. But the great start is belied by a stuttering momentum, making it a film of intermittent pleasures."
m/duma," Kids and animals are often a risky combination, but put them together in a movie such as Duma and you have a winning team."
m/dumb_and_dumber," An execrable catalogue of doody jokes, Dumb and Dumber is an abominable, abdominal comedy."
m/dumb_and_dumber_to," I laughed a lot at this movie, possibly even more than I did at the original film, which I enjoyed quite a bit."
m/dumb_and_dumberer_when_harry_met_lloyd," The humor here is obvious, at best, and the laughs are more groan-inducers than gut-busters."
m/dumbo," Alguns dos esteretipos raciais so desconcertantes, mas o carisma do personagem-ttulo e sua luta contra a rejeio ainda so capazes de emocionar."
m/dumbo_2019," A little too stitched together...The less you know about the original Dumbo, the more you might like this movie."
m/dumbstruck_2011," An exceptionally human comedy, about people who use dummies to express their true feelings - and get paid for it. It is a modest documentary, but a highly entertaining one."
m/dumplin," As it proceeds through a series of teary reconciliations in the last half-hour of its 110-minute run time, the film's didactic drama begins to grate, its treacly emotions feeling increasingly unearned."
m/dungeons_and_dragons, I am certain that this sloppy slice of schlock is hardly what the fandom had in mind.
m/dunkirk_2017," Even as we are left exhausted and stunned by what we've watched, there is an underlying lack of emotional connection that leaves the film as chilly as Nolan's detractors have accused his other pictures of being."
m/dunston_checks_in," An unruly orangutan + an opulent hotel setting equals a natural disaster, or in this case a kids' movie."
m/dunwich_horror, The animated opening credits sequence is the best part of a leadenly paced picture that grows less gripping as it moseys along.
m/duplex, Barrymore is refreshingly without any movie star vanity and seems to relish the chance to look silly.
m/duplicity_2009," Whatever the onscreen dilemma for Clive Owen's Ray and Julia Roberts' Claire, for us, it's a no-brainer. This slick and persuasive crime thriller has so much chemistry and chutzpah; we're hooked from the start"
m/dust2001," In reaching for a cubist style of storytelling, [Manchevski] sacrifices character and motivation."
m/dust_factory," It's the dreariest children's story I've ever seen... gloomy, depressing, and way too long. Somebody get the Hoover - back to dust is where this movie needs to go."
m/dust_to_glory," It's an adrenaline rush of a film, the closest anyone not inside a power-engine dune buggy will get to the love-hate experience of the unpredictable course."
m/dying_breed, Aussie mayhem with cannibalistic inbred idiots and upper middle class whitebread victims fails to set this film apart. But great fun nonetheless.
m/dying_gaul," Writer Lucas (Longtime Companion) makes a disapointing directing debut with an overbaked, preposterously plotted noir thriller whose only novelty is a bisexual man"
m/dying_laughing," Though the engaging documentary treads through unavoidably familiar territory ... its chorus of testifiers often find sharp new angles of approach. Like the jokes they hone, many of their insights arrive with the impact of well-crafted punchlines."
m/dying_of_the_light," Another entry in Schrader's last-lonely-man canon, ""Dying of the Light"" is thin gruel as a thriller."
m/dying_to_know_ram_dass_and_timothy_leary, We can feel the bond that these two men had for each other - and it makes for a genuine love story.
m/dynamite_warrior," Takes a bite out of Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior and Kung Fu Hustle and spits out a superfluous mess of schlocky supernaturalism, uninspired East-meets-West adventure, insipid backstory, and random feats of dexterous human might."
m/dysfunktional_family," The expos portion of DysFunKtional goes more for the funny bone and less for the jugular, and too often segues into America's Funniest Home Videos territory when it should linger on quieter moments."
m/e_demon_2018, Well-worn wickedness on the World Wide Web screens-within-screens thriller. Not scary.
m/eagle_eye," Running, crashes, yelling, and no story. And wait til you hear who the villain is."
m/eagle_vs_shark," I don't care how you do it, you have to see Eagle vs. Shark. At worst, you'll walk away amused. At best, you'll have a new favorite movie. Regardless, you will have a fun time."
m/eagles_of_death_metal_nos_amis_2017," It's a pileup of sorrow, survivor guilt, anger and defiance that sometimes grows unruly."
m/eames_the_architect_and_the_painter_2011," ""I think their marriage was a mystery to everyone,"" an Eames worker notes-an observation true of every couple that you'll wish the filmmakers had explored more deeply."
m/early_man," Whilst not (re)inventing the wheel, it's brilliant fun nonetheless."
m/early_summer," in keeping with the shift in seasons, there is a comic lightness to the proceedings - even if, as the film draws towards its conclusion, we become increasingly aware of autumn's chilly approach."
m/earth_girls_are_easy," When it's time for that inevitable return to the planet Jhazzalan, you may hear yourself breathing a sigh of relief."
m/earth_one_amazing_day," The Earth might be the film's titular star but the documentary is really about the sun and how that star's waxing and waning energy over 24 hours shapes life down here, from the warmth of morning to the shadows of night."
m/earth_to_echo, At least Earth to Echo was smart enough to imitate the very best.
m/earthquake," The special effects are of a high order as Los Angeles is razed, so it is unfortunate that the same intelligent attention is not extended to either script or direction."
m/earthquake_bird," Sumptuously filmed yet dramatically inert, Earthquake Bird squanders a game cast on a low-energy, relatively toothless psychosexual thriller."
m/easier_with_practice," Geraghty renders a gutsy, extraordinary portrayal that fully reveals his potential as a sensitive, risk-taking actor with leading-man confidence."
m/east-palace-west-palace," Though too verbose and static, it's the first film to deal explicitly with gay life in China, and as such adds a panel to the growing body of movies about sexual politics in rigid societies."
m/east_is_east, Like watching This Boy's Life with a laugh track superimposed.
m/east_side_sushi," Anthony Lucero's terrific East Side Sushi is hardcore sushi porn, but it's also funny and uplifting."
m/east_side_west_side, Fine ensemble acting illuminates this superior soap.
m/easter_bunny_kill_kill_2010," Easter Bunny, Kill! Kill! revels in its obscenity and packs enough punch to knock out even the most jaded of viewers. You've been warned."
m/easter_parade, It is Easter Paradewith Fred Astaire that's the prime example of what made Frances Gumm our Judy Garland.
m/eastern_boys_2013," Illegal immigration, unequal relationships and gay sex are put under the microscope in this compelling and slyly urgent drama."
m/eastern_promises," Taut, smart and brutal, without a single extraneous moment, this is a breathtakingly powerful meditation on good, evil, and the complexity of modern societies."
m/eastwest," Too often murky and with too many characters, the film works best when the director focuses attention firmly on the leads and their actions."
m/easy," Weinstock takes you down a well-trod path in romantic comedy, but her characters are smart and funny, the twists are unexpected and, for once, a romantic triangle is presented realistically with the choice a woman must face being anything but easy."
m/easy-a," A sassy and funny movie that gives imagination, pluck, and creative playfulness a good name."
m/easy_living," It's made with a great pulse, but lacks the height of Jacques Tourmeur's other unforgettable films. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/easy_living_2017," A character study of an endlessly flawed human being, Easy Living thankfully avoids heavy moralizing or platitudinous bromides and it even makes familiar situations ... seem fresh."
m/easy_money_hard_to_kill, There's ultimately little in the way of authentically resonant drama underneath the film's self-conscious busy-ness.
m/easy_rider," Hopper, Fonda and their friends went out into America looking for a movie and found instead a small, pious statement (upper case) about our society (upper case), which is sick (upper case). It's pretty but lower case cinema."
m/eat_drink_man_woman, The results often yield unknown surprises and treats.
m/eat_pray_love," Like any beloved book with a pretty film version, there will be fans of this film, in spite of its flaws. And bless them. I was, mostly, frustrated."
m/eat_that_question_frank_zappa_in_his_own_words," Zappa's prickly demeanor is on full display, and it's to Schütte's credit that he finds what Zappa doesn't say as illuminating as what he does."
m/eat_the_rich," It feels like punk on the downward swing, after most of its rude energy has dissipated."
m/eating_animals, Farm docu's stomach-churning stories offer food for thought.
m/eating_out," In this dreary erotic roundelay, Caleb (Scott Lunsford) is a straight man who likes tough women."
m/eating_out_2_sloppy_seconds," A Rubik's Cube of shifting sexual orientation and elaborate sex fantasies, Sloppy Seconds gathers all the accouterments of soft pornography ... into a plot of stunning imbecility."
m/eating_out_3," It needs to be emphasized that Eating Out 3 has nothing to do with the restaurant business, lest any foodies wander into this ineptly written and acted gay sex comedy by accident."
m/eating_raoul, Eating Raoul is a lively black comedy about the aftershocks of the sexual revolution in America.
m/eating_up_easter, Eating Up Easter is deft in the way it explores ... finding a balance between vital tradition and the unstoppable momentum of modernity.
m/echelon_conspiracy," Of all the pejorative words that could be used to describe this film, perhaps the most apt is amateurish."
m/echo_in_the_canyon, What a wonderful trip to remind us all of a pivotal moment in U.S. history!
m/echoes_of_war_2015, The film never achieves its potential in terms of tension.
m/ecstasy_2012," Clearly has affection for the source material and the cinematic subgenre it reflects, which is probably why it's so terrible."
m/ed," One of the worst, most wrong-headed ""family"" fantasies to come along in some time."
m/ed_wood," Ed Wood would make a great double feature with Citizen Kane, the sad, fascinating lives of two men vying for greatness and almost achieving it."
m/edc_2013_under_the_electric_sky," There's certainly a lot of eye candy to enjoy, from the 3D screensaver graphics in the opening credits to the endless parade of six-pack abs and jiggling underbutt."
m/eddie_murphy_raw," Yes it's raw, but it's inventive genius. Hilarious."
m/eddie_the_eagle," ""Eddie the Eagle"" is as appealing and fluffy as a new pile of dry snow. The factual changes may bother the real Eddie, but this movie keeps its eye strictly on the image of achieving a thing no one expects you to achieve."
m/eddie_the_sleepwalking_cannibal," Because the film clearly aims for satire, Boris Rodriguez isn't entirely guilty of indulging gruesome spectacle for its own sake."
m/eden_1998, Eden mixes New- Age mysticism with preppie banality unconvincingly in a movie that lacks intensity or even a point of view.
m/eden_2012," Scrupulously avoiding salaciousness and overstatement, ""Eden"" translates a true-life tale of human trafficking into an effectively low-key, arrestingly suspenseful drama."
m/eden_2015," Despite its pessimism, the film nonetheless does get lost in the moment whenever house pounds out of abysmally low-ended sound systems."
m/eden_lake," You don't watch it, you survive it. A battering experience, and the hardest Brit horror in years."
m/eden_log, EDEN LOG is visually stunning - it's a bleak trip into a world that both mesmerizing and terrifying.
m/edge," I laughed frequently, but the problem is that I'm not sure the director intended there to be as much humor in his film as I uncovered."
m/edge_of_darkness," In a comeback role (his first in 7 years), Mel Gibson is decent as the grieving, vengeful father, but the effort not effective in resurrecting the paranoia, anti-government, anti-big business thriller, which was popular in the 1970s."
m/edge_of_love," The cast is strong and the first act has an intriguingly dreamy quality, but it gives way to a soggy ending."
m/edge_of_seventeen," It'll resonate with anyone who remembers the awkwardness and elation of their first sexual experiences, because it captures those experiences better and more honestly than practically any other film."
m/edge_of_winter, One comes to resent the film for how it thrills to the possibility of a father hurting his children.
m/edie," It's a strong showcase for Hancock's considerable talent, even if it is somewhat formulaic in its execution."
m/edison_force, Nothing more than a sub-average direct-to-video actioner with a few A-listers stuck in the leads.
m/edmond, a fussy little movie that wants to be much more controversial and important than it is.
m/edtv, Matthew McConaughey...leverages his immense charm to keep this broad comedy--highly reminiscent of the far superior Truman Show--airborne.
m/education_of_charlie_banks," For a man prone to unleashed inhibitions, [director] Durst's creative approach feels all bottled up."
m/education_of_little_tree," The film spends far too much time around the moonshine still and hypocritical local church at the cost of other, more interesting lessons."
m/edward_scissorhands," An engaging film, one which falls early in director Tim Burton's career, helping to highlight a remarkable decade's run of moody, quirky and goofy films."
m/edwin_boyd_2012," [VIDEO] Everything about ""Citizen Gangster"" seems second-rate."
m/egg_2019," Daring and modestly accomplished, lifted by two terrific performances."
m/eight_below," It's lucky for human actors that canines can't win Academy Awards, because, if they could, the dogs in Eight Below would sweep next year's Oscars."
m/eight_legged_freaks, A silly and fun B-movie that's best when it's the most ridiculous.
m/eight_men_out," If John Sayles were a ballplayer, they'd call him Lefty -- not for his pitching arm but for his politics. The devoutly liberal filmmaker's political point of view is certain. It's his dramatic focus that sometimes gets fuzzy."
m/eight_miles_high," If most of the film locates Obermeier's quest for freedom in a series of surprisingly drab drug-fueled hookups, then the final section generates slightly greater interest by suggesting an alternate route of exploration."
m/eighth_grade," Whether it's due to Elsie Fisher's lovable turn as Kayla or Bo Burnham's frustratingly accurate portrayal of life as a teen, Eighth Grade is full of life, even if it's from the terrible teenage years of that life."
m/einaym_pkuhot," Hanky panky among Jerusalem's ultra-orthodox is treated with restraint and authenticity, deserving an audience beyond the assumed target of gays, Jewish-interest, and cinephiles."
m/eisenstein_in_guanajuato," Greenaway's habitual approach is perfect for this material, constantly externalizing the director's ideas about Eisenstein's life and work and the way the two are connected in a way that speaks directly -- often quite literally -- to the audience."
m/ejecta," A wearisome, empty-headed mess, barely feeling as if it is a completed film at all. When it is over, its memoryjust like an otherworldly probeall but entirely vanishes in an instant."
m/ek_main_air_ekk_tu," It's not crude, sniggering or vindictive. Instead it's rather sweet and sometimes even a little unexpected."
m/eklavya," This is robust storytelling, with blood and thunder pumping through its veins, and real whiskers on its face."
m/el_artista_y_la_modelo_2013," An exquisitely crafted miniature about the creative rebirth of an aging sculptor, Fernando Trueba's The Artist and the Model brings the same craft and care to its subject as its titular artist does to his own work."
m/el_aura, A hypnotic journey into the head of an epileptic taxidermist with a photographic memory.
m/el_bulli_cooking_in_progress_2010," I enjoyed watching the chefs at work, both researching and preparing a meal with dozens of courses... but afterwards I felt oddly unsatisfied and in need of something a little more filling."
m/el_camino_a_breaking_bad_movie," Aaron Paul delivers one of the best performances of his career, which should keep Breaking Bad's well-earned reputation as a television phenomenon alive and well for years to come."
m/el_cantante," A virtual template of every imaginable cliche of the musical biopic, pic suffers from a lack of narrative and character focus."
m/el_chicano, The problem here isn't the fairly apparent budgetary limits - it's the limitations of style and imagination.
m/el_dorado," Wayne and Mitchum pair up for the first time in a western, and very good it is too."
m/el_mariachi," No festival is true to its name if it doesn't display at least one discovery. In 1992 that spot was occupied by Robert Rodriguez, who made a charming actioner for $7,500; never mind that Columbia later invested $1 million for its theatrical release."
m/el_norte," The film has a political message, but it is a subtle and compelling one that allows situations and characters to speak for themselves."
m/el_topo, This could quite possibly be the strangest film you'll ever watch. And I mean that in the best possible way. Track this one down.
m/elaine_stritch_shoot_me_2013," Stritch's fearlessness in the face of age and illness dominates; whether she's ribbing 30 Rock's ""Alec 'Joan Crawford' Baldwin"" or berating cinematographer Shane Signer - ""Don't you think you're awfully close to me?!"", her default setting is candid."
m/election," As Tracy Flick, Witherspoon perfectly tows the line between cute and irritating."
m/election_2," For anyone who saw Election, Johnnie To's masterful, modern reworking of the Hong Kong Triad drama and its mythology, Election 2 isn't so much a sequel as a logical extension of the story."
m/electric_boogaloo_the_wild_untold_story_of_cannon_films, (The) Australian director's latest reveals a rich vein of excess and chutzpah that paints a picture of old-school operators steeped in shameless B-movie showmanship.
m/electric_horseman, The Electric Horseman is the kind of movie they used to make.
m/electric_man_2012," Low-budget caper about a stolen comic book that is, with the best will in the world, unfit for human consumption."
m/electric_slide, Self-consciously arty dreck of the most agonizing variety.
m/electroma," Helmers [Daft Punk] bizarrely choose not to use their own catchy tunes here, the one thing that might have given pic slim commercial legs."
m/elektra," Elektra, who has a troubled past like several of Marvel Comics' superheros, is a challenge for filmmakers. While I respect their efforts, I can't recommend the result."
m/elektra-luxx," While milking humor and pathos from porn is a fine idea, Elektra Luxx is too reverent to land any real punches."
m/elena_2012," A film to crow about loudly, and if nothing else one to release, please, surely. Somebody."
m/elephant, The film lacks insight. We learn nothing that advances our understanding of these tragedies beyond the initial news reports.
m/elephant_walk," Delirious mixture of romance and melodrama, with gorgeous location shooting."
m/elevator_to_the_gallows," A stylish noir-ish crime drama boasting, amongst other things, an improvised Miles Davis soundtrack."
m/elf, The first charming present of the holiday movie season.
m/elf_buddys_musical_christmas, Animated version of much-loved tale invites younger viewers.
m/elfie_hopkins_2012, Elfie Hopkins has a promising set-up and some suitably quirky set design but it's let down by a disappointing script and a one-note performance from Jaime Winstone.
m/eli_2019," I absolutely love it when a movie is willing to take such a wild swing. And swing they do ... It won't work for everyone, but boy did I enjoy Eli."
m/elis," Its episodic nature and refusal to clarify who, what or when means that it lacks a cohesive, coherent narrative, with Regina's songs serving as the only connective tissue."
m/elisa_and_marcela," The most emotionally authentic part of the film, by far, are the wedding snapshots that run with the end credits..."
m/elite_squad," Pois  infinitamente mais recompensador assistir a um filme que estimula a discusso e a auto-anlise do que um que, por covardia ou falta de ambio, limita-se a seguir a corrente do politicamente correto."
m/elite_squad_the_enemy_within," Embora continuação de uma produção de sucesso, o filme tem aspirações muito mais nobres do que apenas arrancar mais alguns trocados do público."
m/eliza_graves," The lunatics have seldom taken over the asylum so literally, yet to so little reward, as in ""Stonehearst Asylum."""
m/elizabeth_harvest," There's a good way of doing a modern retelling of Bluebeard (see: Ex Machina), but Elizabeth Harvest is not it."
m/elizabethtown, Dunst and Bloom were far more believable in their widely watched comic book and fantasy films
m/ella_enchanted," From the very beginning, the film's primary dysfunction is that it can't decide exactly how smarmy or adorably postmodern it wants to be."
m/elle_2016, Huppert's long-standing genius for expressing complex cocktails of emotions with casual precision is vital to this role.
m/elles_2011," Binoche is, as always, superb, but Malgorzata Szumowska's film won't tell you much about the oldest profession that you didn't already know - and Binoche's marital clashes feel like a standard feminist tract circa 1975."
m/ellie_parker," Ellie's story is as old as Hollywood, but Coffey brings to it a fresh, frenzied and often painfully raw vision in which Ellie begins to feel that her personality is as fragmented as life in Los Angeles can be."
m/elling," The film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders, but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill."
m/elsa_and_fred_2014, Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer bring class and depth to subpar material in the septuagenarian romance Elsa & Fred.
m/elstree_1976," A sweet, quietly funny, fascinating and contemplative study of 10 character actors and extras, none of whom had any idea back in the 1970s they'd forever be defined by the one or two days they spent on the set of a sci-fi movie."
m/elvira_mistress_of_the_dark, There are only a couple of fresh and funny moments.
m/elviras_haunted_hills, The campy results make Mel Brooks' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated.
m/elvis_and_nixon_2016, An imaginative narrative comedy based on the unrecorded meeting between President Nixon and Elvis Presley.
m/elvis_from_outer_space," The special effects look like they were created on a classroom computer circa 2004, and there are, of course, no actual Elvis songs in the movie."
m/elvis_thats_the_way_it_is, The definitive portrait of Elvis the Vegas headliner follows the King through his 1970 summer engagement in Las Vegas from backstage bustle to box-office hustle to 27 stage numbers.
m/elysium_2013," It might not be the thinking man's fill-in-the-blank that some viewers were eagerly anticipating, but it's a solid adventure that oversells its deeper meanings."
m/emanuel," Emanuel should be required viewing to consistently remind us that we should never become comfortable with mass shootings. That is not the America I grew up in and shouldn't be the America you want for your children. Thank you Viola, Steph and Mariska."
m/embrace_of_the_serpent," The ravages of colonialism cast a dark pall over the stunning South American landscape in Embrace of the Serpent, the latest visual astonishment from the gifted Colombian writer-director Ciro Guerra."
m/embrace_of_the_vampire, Just look at the cast and walk quickly past the rental shelf...quickly...
m/emelie, ...one of the most powerful physical experiences I can remember having this side of a movie screen.
m/emma_2020," Elevated by an impeccable ensemble cast and gorgeous production values, 'Emma.' is a blissful delight that's bursting with sharp wit, giddy humour, and charming romance."
m/emmanuels_gift, A touching and almost ridiculously inspirational story for all of us.
m/emmet_otters_jugband_christmas, That rowing scene? It's the equivalent of watching a ventriloquist work his dummy while drinking a glass of water. Such technical wizardry abounds in Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas.
m/empathy_inc," Overall, Empathy, Inc. is a unique dramatic thriller with a well-paced mystery component."
m/emperor_2012," Given its true-life basis, the story is already devoid of suspense regarding Hirohito's ultimate fate, and Fellers's inquiry is made more sluggish by dramatically inert conversations ..."
m/emperor_2020, Emperor depicts an important piece of American history and gives Shields Green his due years after being forgotten.
m/emperors_new_clothes," A minor, offbeat achievement, yet particularly impresses with its strong central performances from a masterly Holm and a sensitive Hjelje."
m/emperors_new_groove," If Walt Disney were to wander into the multiplex tonight, he'd wonder which studio did this animated film."
m/empire_in_africa, It's possible that Diaz's sympathy for the RUF is symptomatic of a lingering tendency on the left to sanctify anything that calls itself a revolutionary front.
m/empire_of_the_ants," One of those movies that's a nailbiter for a little kid, but laughable when revisted as an adult."
m/empire_of_the_sun, The movie is always interesting from a narrative point of view. Spielberg is a good storyteller with a good tale to tell. But it never really adds up to anything.
m/empire_records," If the movie is a lost cause, it may at least showcase actors who have better things ahead of them."
m/empire_strikes_back," For many Star Wars fans, this second installment is the best of the George Lucas trilogy: a dark, ultimately melancholy, even philosophical episode that has no triumphant happy ending."
m/employee_of_the_month, Simpson has the charisma and screen presence of a wet towel.
m/en_kongelig_affaere," Arcel's classically old-fashioned candlelight-and-carriages take on the bosom-heaving, aristocratic love triangle is a compelling if slightly overlong effort."
m/en_soap, [The film takes] some of its cues from the soaps and melodramas the characters watch together and others from a realist tradition of considerable emotional heft.
m/enchanted," Essentially postmodern and deconstructivist, what could have been a mishmash of animation and live action, fantasy and realism, CG effects and handdrawn segments, under Lima's inspired helm becomes a unified entertainment suitable for kids and adults."
m/enchanted_april, That's what's appealing about the movie (everyone walks away happy) and also forgettable (everyone walks away mush).
m/end_game_2018, Netflix's new documentary End Game is deeply unnerving. It's so matter of fact about life's harshest truth that it can't help but force deep introspection.
m/end_of_america, It's actually an intriguingly level-headed approach to a hugely emotive issue.
m/end_of_days," Ahnuld's latest action dud is one huge Millennium bug bomb, a sad, pyrotechnic rehashing of yet another The-Devil-Takes-a-Bride concept..."
m/end_of_poverty, It's startling to realize that locales supplying most resources we consider most valuable are Earth's most poverty-stricken spots. The film makes a compelling argument that our economic system is the equivalent of human doom.
m/end_of_sentence," End of Sentence is a familiar story at heart, but beautifully observed, sensitively played and smart enough to wrong-foot audience expectations whenever the plot gets too comfortable."
m/end_of_the_century_the_story_of_the_ramones," It's hard not to feel that the Ramones, who never had a hit record, were the greatest band in 50 years to be stonewalled out of success."
m/end_of_the_spear, This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and peace-seeking Christian missionaries is inspiring despite its sentimental excesses.
m/end_of_violence," A horrendous, useless, soulless, sprawling two hours of your life you will not get back."
m/end_of_watch," Compared to an average episode of 'Criminal Minds,' it's pretty good."
m/enders-game," Yet another intriguing, complex, strangely unlikeable big-budget experiment destined to thrill the fans and befuddle the rest of us."
m/endings_beginnings," The movie aims to make Daphne's journey raw and real, but mostly it's just insipid."
m/endless, Amiable leads Alexandra Shipp and Nicholas Hamilton - along with a thoughtfully in-sync supporting cast - keep things unfolding in a kind-hearted place when the screenplay could have easily marooned the audience in a copycat purgatory.
m/endless_love," Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Scott Spencer's novel is bound to be mystified by Franco Zeffirelli's latest film, which reduces Endless Love to a whimperingly latter-day Romeo and Juliet with a little pyromania thrown in."
m/endless_love_2014," Endless Love is the type of film that resorts to big soundtrack moments to let viewers know how they should be feeling, which has the effect of highlighting the movie's failings even more."
m/endless_poetry," Alejandro Jodorowsky's 'Endless Poetry' is the most accessible movie he has ever made, and it may also be the best. It's Felliniesque and moving."
m/endless_summer," A lot more intriguing than any ""surfing documentary"" oughtta be."
m/endurance_1999, Its mixture of biographical hype and social studies quickly curdles.
m/enduring_love," Razor-walking self-consciousness (or just plain braininess) is perhaps impossible to depict coherently on-screen, and the someone's-watching-me vibe is otherwise overfamiliar to moviegoers."
m/enemies-of-the-people, Leave it to a documentary on the atrocities of a Cambodian genocide to get everything actually right about the way humans store information and retrieve it.
m/enemies_a_love_story, Enemies offers a giddy ride that ultimately goes nowhere.
m/enemies_closer, Enemies Closer is the first collaboration between Peter Hyams and Jean-Claude Van Damme since 1995's Sudden Death. The reunion feels long overdue.
m/enemies_of_laughter," Paymer has developed a sort of practiced gravitational pull, and his easy confidence, enhanced by eyes that can only be described as soulful, elevates his character from a flat Woody Allen wannabe to a fully realized human being."
m/enemy_2013," Thick with weighty themes, disquieting portent and anxious tension, Villeneuve...crafts a gripping slow burn portrait of the male id/ego, our self-destructive tendencies and how they control us."
m/enemy_at_the_gates," Has impressive moments, but they're buried in a rubble of melodramatic excess that would have seemed corny in a film made while the war was actually being waged."
m/enemy_lines," The action unfolds like a game of capture the flag, full of chattering machine guns and bodies bleeding out in the snow, playing like the kind of generic action movie parodied in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds,"
m/enemy_mine, It depends on plot gimmicks like the convenient arrival of enemies and the equally convenient arrival of friends to the rescue. It doesn't dare enough.
m/enemy_of_the_state," La tecnologa actual resulta en muchas ocasiones contraproducente, ya que mientras ms tecnificado se encuentra el ser humano es ms fcil quitarle su identidad propia"
m/england_is_mine," As an account of the Adrian Mole-like growing pains of the depressive young would-be artist, the film makes surprisingly poignant viewing."
m/english_patient," It didn't quite make my top 10 list, but it is not bad."
m/english_vinglish," The image of the newly confident Shashi striding down a Manhattan street, a takeout coffee in hand and a trench coat belted over her sari, will make you smile days after you leave the theater."
m/enigma_of_kaspar_hauser," There is a profound philosophy at the base of Kasper Hauser: How does emotional growth occur, deprived of any foreign influence, sociological, familial or otherwise?"
m/enough_said_2013," While the conversation sparkles and amuses as ever, there are indications here that Holofcener's uniquely perceptive voice has begun to calcify somewhat into a familiar house style."
m/enron_the_smartest_guys_in_the_room," Even beyond its failure as absorbing film or clarification, lies the waste of a wonderful tale just begging to be told..."
m/entanglement_2018, The filmmakers should have concentrated more on script mechanics than quantum mechanics.
m/enter_the_anime, Enter the Anime is an hour-long infomercial for Netflix original anime that wastes everyone's time.
m/enter_the_dangerous_mind, The best thing to be said about the ludicrously titled Enter The Dangerous Mind is that it doesn't waste a lot of time bsing the audience.
m/enter_the_dragon, A classic of its genre that must be seen by any self-respecting movie buff.
m/enter_the_fat_dragon_2020, The end result of this tragic misfire? A derivative action-comedy which delivers on neither front.
m/enter_the_void, [Noe is] using pure cinema and not just cheap exploitation tricks to make an impact.
m/enter_the_warriors_gate," Lumbering and unfunny, the feature is aimed at 10 year olds and perhaps nobody else."
m/entertainment," The challenging experience that is Alverson's latest film, Entertainment, makes The Comedy feel like a walk in the park."
m/entourage," It's a shame none of the women develop past sketches of angry girlfriends and no-name one-night-stands. Sexist, sure, but also a failure of imagination."
m/entrapment, Se sostiene o cae por el peso y entendimiento existente entre sus protagonistas. No le busquen ms
m/entre_les_bras, The second shot alone makes the ensuing 80 or so minutes even more enjoyable.
m/entre_nos," Left with pacing, composition and atmosphere, and scenes with the children in particular (Sebastian Villada Lopez and Laura Montana Cortez, each remarkable) have charm and authenticity."
m/entwined_2020," There is a lot of space here to do something different than the norm, but instead the film wanders through the lush woods, never able to truly progress from its starting point."
m/epic_2013," While it's not a crossover classic, this has enough wit and charm to entertain both big and little people."
m/epic_movie, What was the last studio picture this bad? Maybe 2002's The Adventures of Pluto Nash. I've seen more talent in my cat's last dump.
m/equal_means_equal_2016, A swiftly paced documentary about America's systemic war on women's rights ...
m/equalizer_2," For a film whose hero prides himself on ""equalizing"" the playing field for those who cannot defend themselves, The Equalizer 2 is incredibly uneven."
m/equals_2016, A science-fiction love story set in a world that is visually sheened to evocative perfection - but in which the central premise is creakingly old hat.
m/equilibrium, Superb production values & Christian Bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot.
m/equity," It's appreciated how banker males here were numbskulls and showoffs, while women played the same game by being sophisticated and smart-talking."
m/eragon," I liked Eragon's story so much more when it was called Star Wars. Heck, I was waiting for a Wookie to pop up."
m/erased_2013," Although telling a decent story, on the whole The Expatriate is ultimately rather forgettable - not to mention the frustrating predictability of the narrative."
m/eraser," Manages a few solidly entertaining moments, and serves up the kind of meat-and-potatoes action Schwarzenegger's fans have come to expect."
m/eraserhead, ...I found this imaginative work to be one of the more interesting films to come out of the '70s.
m/erin_brockovich, A completly involving movie that will grab you from the first frame of film to the closing credits.
m/ernest_and_celestine," small-town prejudice and the fear of otherness are roundly exposed for their absurdity, but the sensitivity of the artistic disposition and even the importance of good dental care are also sensibly celebrated."
m/ernest_goes_to_jail," Jim Varney at the peak of his comedic powers, playing two instantly distinctive roles. If you only ever see one Ernest movie, make it this one."
m/ernest_rides_again," The best non-Disney Ernest movie, and a fun ride no matter what stuffy elitists would have you believe"
m/ernest_saves_christmas, A Christmas classic. Jim Varney is sorely missed in my heart.
m/eros_2005, A maddeningly uneven triptych about the vagaries of sexual longing.
m/errand_boy," Jerry Lewis screwball comedy is tedious, lacks kid appeal."
m/errementari_the_blacksmith_and_the_devil, Is visually very attractive. [Full review in Spanish]
m/errors_of_the_human_body," As smart as it is suspenseful and as contemplative as it is creepily effective, the feature swarms with the potential of its competent helmer and commanding lead actor, even as it drifts towards an intriguing conclusion."
m/escaflowne_the_movie, A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down.
m/escanaba_in_da_moonlight," The performances are zesty and consistently enjoyable, with everyone having a high old time speaking in an accent as thick and heavy as a slab of Mackinac Island fudge."
m/escape_and_evasion, ...Escape And Evasion is a cinematic tour of duty worth taking.
m/escape_fire_the_fight_to_rescue_american_healthcare," Like a doctor's carefully structured analysis of a patient's condition, the film breaks down its massive subject into manageable, clear, but not simplified parts."
m/escape_from_alcatraz, Escape from Alcatraz is relentless in establishing a mood and pace of unrelieved tension.
m/escape_from_la," Intermittently clever ideas are rarely executed to full effect, but the film moves reasonably well on its way to surround-sound pyrotechnics amid a climactic aerial attack."
m/escape_from_planet_earth_2013, Escape from Planet Earth's flaws would be more forgivable if the film offered better fun for younger viewers.
m/escape_from_pretoria," Despite an inherently cinematic story and some effective sequences, Escape From Pretoria struggles to transcend a clunky, one-dimensional script."
m/escape_from_the_planet_of_the_apes, It's a long way down from even the second in the series.
m/escape_from_tomorrow_2013," One wishes a few different decisions had been made, especially during post-production, but no one can deny the originality of a piece that's unlike anything else to play in Park City (or anywhere for that matter) in 2013."
m/escape_plan," A relic the 80s, an action flick era well into its fourth decade."
m/escape_plan_2_hades," Stallone is in it just enough to make it worth watching for die-hard fans, but don't let the marketing fool you into thinking him and Bautista are anything more than supporting players in this one."
m/escape_plan_the_extractors," Flabbergastingly lazy bargain basement tosh from Sly and co., and one unlikely to please even the scarce few who enjoyed its rancid predecessor."
m/escape_room_2019," Robitel demonstrates a continued growth as a filmmaker here, and I am hoping there's more Escape Room fun awaiting us in the future..."
m/escape_to_witch_mountain, hardly the kind of experience that spawns anyone's desire to buy action figures and vibrating brooms
m/essential_killing, This is minimalist filmmaking at its most austere and effective.
m/esteros_2016," Taking characters of a previous shortfilm, the director elaborates a valuable and sensitive look on sexual identity. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/estranged_2015," Estrangement is a portrait of a broken society told in microcosmic form, but it is at its most potent in exploring very ordinary horrors."
m/et_the_extraterrestrial, Only the most hardened heart should be able to resist the glow from the one that anchors this classic.
m/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind, Works like a visual poem with razor sharp writing and some of the best acting yet from a powerhouse cast.
m/ethan-mao," For a low-budget indie with no special effects, Ethan Mao is a treat to look at."
m/ethan_frome," Even when you know it is coming, it still takes your breath away."
m/etoiles_dancers_of_the_paris_opera_ballet, A fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichs and showcases a group of dedicated artists.
m/etz_limon, Israeli director Eran Riklis's drama boasts a gentle nuance and emotive humour.
m/eulogy," For something witty, funny, and ultimately well-performed you can't go pass it..Zooey Deschanel is just delightful, she's definitely one to watch"
m/euphoria_2017, Plays as if it might have come from Yorgos Lanthimos' bin of discarded ideas.
m/eureka_1984," More a curio than a straightforward classic, Nicolas Roeg's Eureka is beyond weird."
m/europa_report, It doesn't feel like a huge event(the scientific accuracy leaves the film feeling a bit dry and procedural)... but the heft and thrills are just enough to recommend it.
m/eurotrip," Eurotrip has everything going against it, yet it manages to win you over on every level on which you think it is going to fail."
m/eva, There's not much wonder that practically everybody who had anything to do with the making of this film was offering excuses and alibis when it opened in Europe in 1962.
m/eva_hesse_2016," Hesse's interest was more a matter of process than product. Begleiter's movie picks up the next two sentences to give Hesse the poignant existential credo that serves as her last word. ""Life doesn't last; art doesn't last. It doesn't matter."""
m/evan_almighty," Evan Almighty runs out of comic invention early, and the filmmakers fall back on what real politicians do when they exhaust their small stash of ideas: brainless piety."
m/evelyn, A shamelessly uplifting motion picture that attains its feel-good status by forging a deep emotional connection between the undertrodden protagonist and the audience.
m/even_money," Shouldn't an overwrought drama about the life-shattering effects of gambling addiction make some effort, before delivering its moral, to show why people gamble in the first place?"
m/even_stevens_movie," The Even Stevens Movie could make you think of Gilligan's Island -- it's not great television, but fans should be pleased."
m/even_the_rain," Subtlety isn't exactly a strength of Even the Rain. But when that's a film's only weakness, it's easy enough to overlook."
m/evening," In Evening, an all-star team of filmmakers takes on a minor-league story."
m/evening_star," The script is by the director Robert Harding, and all his jokes fall like stones."
m/event_horizon," A pathetic, gratuitous gorefest posturing itself as the heir to the Alien sci-fi/horror throne"
m/ever_after_a_cinderella_story, Ever After turns out to be a potent and imaginative retelling that proves Cinderella's timelessness defies carbon-dating.
m/everest_1998, The cinematographers must perform Herculean labor to even film the adventure
m/everest_2015," Although hardly a peak achievement, Baltasar Kormakur's Himalayan epic is a properly grueling, strikingly unsentimental chronicle of the 1996 Mount Everest tragedy."
m/evergreen," For all kind and admirable reasons, Zentelis wants to portray America's working poor, but she only gets deep enough to pity them."
m/evergreen_the_road_to_legalization_in_washington, ...does what most activist documentaries about hot-button issues don't: It successfully shows all sides of the argument.
m/everlasting, The portrayal of its young lovers torn apart by murder so cruel has a certain power that intrigues and engrosses.
m/everlasting_piece, The movie finds charming humor in a world full of sectarian strife between Protestant and Catholic.
m/everly," a leering flick: leering at violence, leering at Hayek, leering at a level of child-peril that's actually exploitative rather than suspenseful."
m/every_act_of_life, This lively Kickstarter-funded tribute endorses that fellowship with admiration and gratitude.
m/every_again," The information in the film is frightening, to say the least, but as a documentary, the film has serious flaws."
m/every_day_2010," Ace thesps struggle to lift this dour indie out of the doldrums, but writer-director Richard Levine allows them no breathing room."
m/every_day_2018, Remains stuck in a stubborn rut somewhere between confusing and snooze-inducing.
m/every_little_step," Groundbreaking in terms of its in-depth coverage, but also an incredibly moving portrait of a musical that's as relevant today as it was thirty years ago."
m/every_secret_thing," Pitched somewhere between a David Fincher crime procedural, a Denis Lehane suspense novel and a Mommie Dearest melodrama, documentarian Amy Berg's move into the feature-length world of dramatic narrative is...an uneven one."
m/every_thing_will_be_fine," The premise, of a terrible event unleavened by the easy out of someone being at fault, should be prime fodder for Wenders's brand of poetic regret."
m/every_time_i_die," With just a singular location and five characters Michael and Katzir hurdle us into a mind-bending metaphysical thriller that is, truly, remarkable."
m/every_which_way_but_loose, The plot remains as flat as the treacly country-western score.
m/everybody_knows," Halfway between a family drama of rural ambience, a pseudo-political intrigue and a meditation on guilt... [Everybody Knows] lacks dramatic force and stylistic tension, and ends up shipwrecked, in a resounding way. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/everybody_loves_somebody," With ingenious dialogues and gifted with humor, Catalina Aguilar Maestreta delivers a very entertaining film. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/everybody_wants_some," A lot of it's funny - for instance, any scenes involving Powell's admittedly charming Finnegan or Hoechlin's testy McReynolds - but hanging out with these guys eventually becomes a chore."
m/everybody_wants_to_be_italian, Has more the feeling of a TV serial than a well-structured movie.
m/everybodys_allamerican," Corny, overblown, dopey and yet somehow entertaining, the screenplay sounds as if it were cowritten by Dick Butkus and Jackie Collins."
m/everybodys_famous," Deruddere seems intent on indicting the television culture for promoting unrealistic hopes of stardom, but the film ultimately embraces the medium as a means of self-fulfillment."
m/everyday_2013," Although detractors might wish for something more profound, capturing the poignant pointlessness of life passing by feels like a noble pursuit in itself."
m/everyday_sunshine_the_story_of_fishbone_2011, The fun and energy of those performances show the promise that was lost - and the pleasure that's still in the music.
m/everyone_stares_the_police_inside_out," Everyone Stares is an unprecedented look at the brief career of one of rock's all-time greatest acts, but disappoints more than it illuminates."
m/everyones_hero, I can't say Everyone's Hero strikes out -- it might distract little kids for a while -- but the directors needn't bother practicing their home run trots.
m/everything_everything_2017," ""Thinking is overrated,"" says Olly at one point; it's probably the best philosophy with which to approach this film."
m/everything_is_illuminated," Maybe it's me, but I prefer my quirky comedies without a side of Holocaust."
m/everything_must_go, The film just doesn't mine enough humor or drama from this situation. Meanwhile most of the developments are wholly predictable.
m/everything_strange_and_new," Frazer Bradshaw's debut feature reeks of a need to do something grand, and its attempt to reach high art makes its failure that much more obvious."
m/everything_you_always_wanted_to_know_about_sex_but_were_afraid_to_ask, Funny the first time. Multiple viewings offer nothing.
m/everythings_cool, Everything's Cool understands that a pretty face like Jake Gyllenhaal's in The Day After Tomorrow is sometimes necessary to sell an important story.
m/eves_bayou," Its racial and gender crossover potential is great, given the solid, realistic acting."
m/evidence_2013," The film isn't as smart as it thinks it is, and its characters are painfully generic."
m/evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn," Harkening back to influences for his 8mm shorts, Raimi owes more to the Three Stooges than he does to horror convention."
m/evil_under_the_sun," Evil Under the Sun is a lush, clever, and entertaining gem that is more than worth the sit."
m/evilspeak," Recommendable only to the staunchest of horror geeks, like myself, Evilspeak is a fairly noteworthy little horror chestnut for a variety of colorful reasons."
m/evita, I doubt any director could have made a good movie from Andrew Lloyd Webber's baffling and shallow musical.
m/evocateur_the_morton_downey_jr_movie," Watching a movie about the late trash-TV pioneer turns out to be fascinating, even when his story is told as messily as it is here."
m/evolution_2016, A sustained visual tour-de-force that's the opposite of a popcorn movie.
m/ex-drummer," Ex Drummer is a mess of a film, a tawdry, bizarre tale that has enough visual style to set it apart, barely, from being a complete waste of several hours of your life."
m/ex_machina," Anchored by three dazzling central performances, it's a stunning directorial debut from Alex Garland that's essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in where technology is taking us."
m/exam_2008, Claustrophobic psychological-drama is a flawed but intriguing exercise in script writing ingenuity and economy.
m/examined_life, Examined Life feeds your head relatively painlessly.
m/excalibur, Somehow it combines legendary material both visually and audibly that hooks me every time.
m/excess_baggage, This entertaining drama helps us see that meaningful coincidences join us with the right people just when we need each other the most.
m/excision_2012," This is one of the damnedest ""adolescent misfit"" movies you'll ever see -- for those who can stomach the splatter, that is."
m/excuse_me_for_living," Vaguely misogynistic and defiantly paternalistic, the movie fails at nearly everything - comic tone, sex gags, charm, logic, direction of actors ..."
m/executive_action, While not thoroughly convincing it is consistently engrossing.
m/executive_suite," Here is a magnificent motion picture that meets the standard of greatness on almost every count. Running a fast 103 minutes, Executive Suite holds the viewer from the opening scene, building absorbingly to a smashing climax."
m/exhibition_2014, Hogg captures the chilliness of indecision and the problems that can come from lives dominated by the cycle of work - although she also gives a sense of the shared bond between the characters.
m/exiled," While certainly an entertaining enough romp through the world of bullet-defying tough guys, the movie could use perhaps 10% more action or 15% less chit-chat."
m/existenz, Cronenberg slides between reality and virtual reality with such seamless morphing that it is sometimes intentionally unclear what world the characters are in.
m/exists," Bigfoot lives, but every other element in Exists is DOA."
m/exit_plan," Even with a nuanced performance from Coster-Waldau and beautiful cinematography, Exit Plan is a slow-burn drama that fizzles out in the end."
m/exit_through_the_gift_shop," The film is a rousing tribute to street art, a crafty autobiography and a cheeky comment on the bravado of artists, talented or otherwise, and the gullibility of their punters - us included."
m/exit_wounds," Between the comic bits and bone-crunching, metal-ripping violence, there's a lot of dead space thanks to a script that fires dramatic blanks."
m/exodus_gods_and_kings," It's hard to tell whether Ridley Scott's Exodus is a misfire satire or a creative misfire, but I suspect it's the latter given that it takes itself so seriously"
m/exorcism_of_emily_rose, Fascinating and engaging. A psychological legal thriller with a compelling subject matter. Makes you think about the possibility of demon possession.
m/exorcist, I simply see no justification for such sacrilege. You know what scene I mean.
m/exorcist_3," Better than part two, and almost scary in one part."
m/exorcist_ii_the_heretic, Possibly the worst film ever made and surely the worst sequel ever made.
m/exorcist_the_beginning," A plodding mess of a movie, with very few frights, and those that are there are all timeworn clichs."
m/expelled_no_intelligence_allowed," The man made famous by Ferris Bueller, however, quickly wades into waters far too deep for him."
m/experiment_in_terror, Superior thriller from before Edwards' typecasting as a comedy specialist.
m/experimenter," Milgram's study was a landmark in the field of social psychology, and the themes have lots of potential to explored on film. But the biopic format and storytelling choices cause ""Experiment"" to fall completely flat. It's a missed opportunity."
m/expired, A touching and unlikely romance that is no gloss but all heart and brains.
m/explicit_ills," Explicit Ills is a filmic tapestry, and it is a cohesive, fluid one."
m/exploding_girl," This is another dreary collaboration by husband-wife team Bradley Rust Gray and So Yong Kim, who have no idea what to do with a simple narrative."
m/explorers," Explorers,' which is lively but largely familiar until the point when it reaches its batty pinnacle, frequently shows off Mr. Dante's sense of humor to good advantage."
m/exporting_raymond_2011," Rosenthal's fine sense of humor is amplified by his narrative ability. Educational, instructive, funny...should be required viewing as a primer for doing business in Russia."
m/exposed_2016, [Reeves] appears to only have two expressions: sad face and need-a-pee face.
m/exterminating_angels, The beauties of Brisseau's movies lie in their defiantly messy imperfections: pretty poison all the way.
m/extinction_2015," [After an interesting first half, Extinction] consumes its own brains and becomes another mindless creature feature."
m/extinction_2018," A B-movie with a blockbuster attitude, and not in a fun way."
m/extra_man," Much of The Extra Man concerns Henry, portrayed with relentless propulsion by Kevin Kline."
m/extraction_2015," Very low-rent with a phoned-in Bruce Willis performance. However, director Steven C. Miller and game stars Gina Carano and Kellan Lutz contribute a few solid action scenes."
m/extraction_2020," No judgments here if you just want to hang back and let nonstop gore, gunfire, explosions and a gung-ho Chris Hemsworth numb you into submission. Take that, COVID-19."
m/extracurricular," It's fast paced, witty and sometimes sexy, a seductive package with a deceptively smart core and one of the best offerings for young audiences."
m/extraordinary_measures," Harrison Ford executive produces and stars, as ""angry Al Pacino"", in a Hallmark TV movie."
m/extraordinary_tales, It offers a CliffsNotes encapsulation of Edgar Allen Poe's most enduring works for viewers unacquainted with them.
m/extraterrestrial_2012," Quirky, but infinitely more interesting than big-budget Hollywood cousins."
m/extraterrestrial_2014," There's no denying it's a nice change from the usual supernatural shenanigans, but the characters, actions and denouement leave a bit too much to be desired."
m/extreme_measures," The movie, written by Tony Gilroy, is pitched at a higher level than most thrillers; the dialogue is literate and intelligent, and Grant is more of an everyman than an action hero."
m/extreme_ops," Worthless, from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames."
m/extremely_loud_and_incredibly_close," It's a preening and somewhat contrived film, a tapestral effort of skilled tradecraft brought to bear upon a self-serious framework of overt manipulations."
m/extremely_wicked_shockingly_evil_and_vile," Less a play-by-play perusal of the killer's methods and perversions, and more an examination of our biases and unending fascination for those among us that find twisted fulfillment in brutality."
m/extremities, A taut film that sheds light on the complicated issue of sexual assault.
m/eye_for_an_eye_1996," With a target as nasty as he, when Karen wants to take the law into her own hands, you can't help thinking, Go to it."
m/eye_in_the_sky," While this performance gives the drama psychological weight, efforts of those on the ground to get the girl out of harm's way introduce very satisfying action elements."
m/eye_of_the_dolphin, A lonely dolphin serves as a mediator in the reconciliation of a father and daughter who don't know how to connect with each other.
m/eyes_of_laura_mars," Clearly we are not dealing with a movie here; this is a producer's package, a market-researched gratification kit ripe for fast saturation-merchandising."
m/eyes_of_tammy_faye, unpretentious documentary that gives us a much deeper understanding of a most intriguing icon
m/eyes_wide_shut," To us, Eyes Wide Shut brought great disappointment."
m/eyes_without_a_face_1962, Sends a chill that extends from the cheekbones through the eye sockets to the back of the skull.
m/f," Pulsing, paranoid and downright eerie, this is a hoodie thriller with proper scares John Carpenter would be proud of."
m/f_for_fake, An almost impossibly lively pastiche of images and ideas that never tires.
m/face_in_the_crowd, Didactic but highly effective little black comedy from the folks who gave you 'On the Waterfront.' Andy Griffith is downright scary.
m/face_to_face_2011," But, apart from an excess of hugging, which Hakim objects to too, this is a really riveting piece of drama which barely tests the talents of Michael Rymer as director, but my goodness he does a good job here."
m/faceoff," Travolta plays the over-the-top, oddball villain with gusto, but it is Cage who really impresses, striking no false notes in the more difficult, subtle, emotional role."
m/faces," Along with A Woman Under the Influence, Cassavetes' most popular movie among critics, art-house audiences and Academy members."
m/faces_places, You can not help but admire a woman of almost 90 years still interested in making a fresh and personal cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
m/facing_the_giants, The wholesomeness of the message and the movie's cast make it feel 1950s retro.
m/facing_windows," Filtered through the unsparing prism of history, it's a unique and powerful portrait of a marriage."
m/factory_girl," George Hickenlooper's impressionistic biopic Factory Girl is a strange little affair, and not a wholly successful one."
m/factotum," One of the Cannes Film Fest discoveries, Bent Hamer's Factotum, inspired by Charles Bukowski's work, captures the early life of the iconoclastic street poet."
m/faculty, Rodriguez puts his money into the predictable place - special effects - and you wonder where the imagination went.
m/fading_gigolo," A charming, funny and oddball drama about a gentle, quiet, and sensitive florist who knows how to give women pleasure."
m/fados," Carlos Saura's valentine to fado, Portugal's blues music, is exciting despite the director's imposition of dance production numbers which add a note of dissonance."
m/fagara," The movie succeeds, mostly because of the degree of care taken with each woman's background, which is rooted in concerns peculiar to their age, class and society."
m/fahrenheit_119," Few can match Moore's gift for agitprop mischief when he's in this mood, and things build to an apocalyptic crescendo, complete with warnings of authoritarianism, armed insurrection, and even nuclear war."
m/failsafe, Still impressive Cold War thriller from a time when WW III seemed inevitable.
m/failure_to_launch," A nice premise with poignant sociological foundation (adult children living with parents) gets a crude treatment in this romantic comedy, which suffers from repetitive structure and lack of stylishness considering its caliber of stars."
m/fair-game-2010," Doesn't quite live up to [its] promise but ... it's mature, smart and engaging and, critically, strikes a new tone for Liman's work."
m/fairy_tale_a_true_story, A film with no discernable point of view that's directed at no definable audience.
m/faith_of_our_fathers_2015," The acting is atrocious, the dialogue a disgrace and the props look like they were designed by a conscripted middle-school drama club."
m/fake_it_so_real_2011," ""Fake It So Real"" filled me with affection for its down-and-out heroes, a group of semi-pro wrestlers in Lincolnton, N.C."
m/falcon_and_the_snowman," Though Penn and Hutton perform admirably, the film fails to be interesting."
m/falcon_rising," Beyond isolated moments of dickish charm - and his climactic four-way fight involving a sword, a crucifix, and two steel pipes - Chapman just comes across like another pseudo-heroic American behaving badly abroad."
m/fall_of_fujimori," Her film remains an intriguing portrait, even if its acceptance of Fujimori's shrugging demeanor and blame- storming serve to detour our concern from its proper place."
m/fall_of_the_roman_empire," Commodus, played here by the flamboyant Christopher Plummer, forsakes the Pax Romana and turns Rome into an empire of camp."
m/fallen-falling," Part feel-bad cinema and part female-bonding session, Barbara Albert's Big Chill-ish melodrama gathers together five former schoolmates who meet up again at a professor's funeral."
m/fallen_2016," A nearly incomprehensible farrago of the tropes of young adult literature and pseudo-religious myth, hobbled by a trio of uncharismatic leads and exploding at the end with some hilarious not-so-special effects."
m/fallen_idol, A marvel of postwar British skill with a frisson of Gallic flavor.
m/falling-angels, There's little intelligence or realism evident on screen.
m/falling_down," The film ... is actually about a great sadness which turns into madness, and which can afflict anyone who is told, after many years of hard work, that he is unnecessary and irrelevant."
m/falling_overnight," Seems designed to have a love-will-find-you serendipity about it, but instead comes off as formless and inane."
m/fame, It's a crack at the American Dream which carries all the exhilaration and depth of a 133-minute commercial break.
m/fame_ish," 'Fame-ish' is easy to digest. The atmosphere is very realistic, since the film was shot at Geek Kon 12 in Middleton, Wis., and many of the extras are actual convention attendees."
m/family_business," Just barely worth checking out, and even then, it's only for the actors."
m/family_jewels," Since I find one Jerry Lewis too much, seven of them was way too much for me to handle."
m/family_man," You'll be land-cruising the kids to gymnastics practice with a smile on your face and a song in your heart, even as selected neurons short-circuit, snap, sizzle and leave the building with Elvis."
m/family_plot," Once you tap into the film's gentle satire of its characters and genre, its strengths become apparent."
m/family_romance_llc," On a formal level, it's a fascinating study of the artifice of the genre, a deconstruction of the comforting contract between artist and viewer that guides us towards a particular kind of emotional or intellectual engagement."
m/family_stone," Despite its flaws, The Family Stone sparkles bright with originality."
m/family_thing," It's likely to be overrated by some and underrated by others, and both contingents will be wrong. One can't, however, overrate the performances, with auntie ruling the roost in more ways than one."
m/family_weekend," In need of a more judicious editor and a game plan to approach the steady erosion of marriage with a profound hit of honesty, not just a sitcom-style presentation of forced therapy."
m/fanboys, You're better off watching The Star Wars Holiday Special on YouTube. At least Bea Arthur sings.
m/fando_and_lis," For all its invocations of theater of cruelty, Fando and Lis hardly ever scares up anything stronger than unpleasant whimsey."
m/fanny_and_alexander," A fitting introduction to the very personal cinema of this master craftsman, not only because it exhibits Bergman's signature themes and stylistic devices, but also because it is one of his most life-affirming films."
m/fantasia_2000," Where else can you see Perlman's hair in such stunning details, find Donald Duck as a major character in a Bible story and experience the distinctive mixture of comfort and grandeur that Disney excels in creating?"
m/fantastic_beasts_and_where_to_find_them," Rowling and Yates have given us a terrifically good-natured, unpretentious and irresistibly buoyant film."
m/fantastic_beasts_the_crimes_of_grindelwald," The second chapter in JK Rowling's five-part story, it's a film stuffed with characters, big moments and impressive spectacle but still feels bizarrely underpowered."
m/fantastic_four, A wasted opportunity to breathe fresh life into the Marvel universe's long-stodgy elder statesmen.
m/fantastic_four_2015," Feels less like a blockbuster for this age of comics-oriented tentpoles than it does another also-ran -- not an embarrassment, but an experiment that didn't gel."
m/fantastic_four_2_rise_of_the_silver_surfer," Superficial, unimaginative and inert. The so-called heroes are pompous, one-note caricatures who have the depth of gnats, and are just as irritating."
m/fantastic_planet," If there ever was a film that needed to be experienced in order to be appreciated, this is it. Reading critics' words about it just does not do it justice."
m/fantastic_voyage," Adventure movies that get bogged down in talk are doomed, even if their premise is wonderful and parts of the film exciting or even inspiring."
m/fantasy_island_2020," A complete mess...a horror movie that's genuinely horrible, its stupidity being exceeded only by its dullness."
m/far_and_away," Well, it WAS better than ""Days of Thunder""... sort of."
m/far_from_heaven, Lacks bite and copies too much from what has come before.
m/far_from_men," In all fairness, Albert Camus' short story L'hote (The Guest) may be too spare and lean to fill a full-length feature film. But also in all fairness, it captures its issues in a far more concise and eloquent manner then David Oelhoffen's film."
m/far_from_the_madding_crowd_2014," Boasts fine performances and pristine technical credits, but fails to make a deep connection as it jolts awkwardly towards a sweet finale."
m/far_from_the_tree," Unfortunately, Far From the Tree ultimately doesn't live up to the sum of its parts, feeling too scattershot and diffuse to produce the desired impact."
m/far_out_isnt_far_enough_the_tomi_ungerer_story," For the most part, Bernstein lets Ungerer, still impish in his 80s, do the talking."
m/farewell," Although it feels slightly generic at times, this reasonably entertaining thriller is made all the more intriguing due to the fact that it is inspired by real events."
m/farewell_herr_schwarz_2014," A complex consideration of what it is to be Jewish and the lengthy aftereffects of atrocities perpetuated on one's past generations, 'Farewell, Herr Schwarz' is an important addition to Holocaust cinema."
m/farewell_my_queen, A costume drama well acted but marred by hazy film quality.
m/farewell_to_arms," It's not as good as the book, but it succeeds in its own right, which is really all I ask of adaptations."
m/fargo," To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, gotten away with them and made a movie that is completely original, and as familiar as an old shoe."
m/farinelli," The kind of high-camp, low-cohesiveness movie that inspires snippy reviews, and sarcasm about the fact that it earned a best foreign film Oscar nomination."
m/farmageddon, A worthy addition to the growing annals of movies and books advocating for sustainable farming methods.
m/farming," The film is remarkable for its lack of self-pity, but it makes the experience of ""Farming"" a merciless one for the audience too."
m/farmingville," This searing documentary argues against the use of near-slave level migrant labor, implying that the United States' economy would collapse without it."
m/farmland," Some of the human-interest stories are compelling, but too much of this film is as dry as a high school classroom presentation."
m/fascination_2005," If you're in the mood for some unscripted belly laughs or a catnap, Fascination should do the trick."
m/fast-track-the-ex," No less than two Ex-men do battle in Jesse Peretz's dog eat dog comedic career brawl The Ex, and it's all about romantic rivalry, office turf wars, and yet another movie along with Waitress, about dining out."
m/fast_and_furious," Noise, noise, noise. Crunched metal and shattered glass. More noise. Revving engines. Vin Diesel's giant head. Hot chicks in tight miniskirts. Even more noise. The end."
m/fast_and_furious_6," Chances are that you already know if you're seeing ""Fast & Furious 6."" And in part, that's because there's a certain solid reliability to the series: it does what it's meant to do well, and doesn't really pay much attention to the rest of it."
m/fast_and_furious_presents_hobbs_and_shaw," This is probably the best Fast & Furious movie of them all. It's easily the most humorous and consistently entertaining, and it functions as more of a standalone film than anything since Tokyo Drift."
m/fast_and_the_furious_tokyo_drift, So what if the movie dumbs down Japanese culture to a bad yakuza movie and features Japanese characters who can barely speak Japanese? The cars are the stars here. Everything else is lost in translation.
m/fast_cheap_and_out_of_control," Fast, Cheap & Out of Control doesn't fade from the mind the way so many assembly line thrillers do. Its images lodge in the memory. To paraphrase the old British beer ad, Errol Morris refreshes the parts the others do not reach."
m/fast_color," With a captivating performance from Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Fast Color is a female-led superhero thriller that touches on the supernatural in a post-Black Panther world."
m/fast_company, An enjoyable pedestrian drive-in B-film about drag racing.
m/fast_five, Five films in and the Fast and the Furious franchise finally gets itself into gear with the wonderfully over the top Fast Five.
m/fast_food_nation," More entertaining than a documentary can be, this fictionalized, muckraking pic could dent the fast food industry if enough people see it."
m/fast_girls_2012," Noel Clarke, who co-scripted and co-stars, doesn't get any Kidulthood-style grit going, though Crichlow's gutsy performance has you rooting for her."
m/fast_times_at_ridgemont_high," Penn has a huge presence in the film, and every whacked line he utters resonates with the sheer hilarity that he fully believes in what he says"
m/fastball," As the boys of summer prepare to take the field again, Fastball is a briskly paced, welcome warm-up, beer and peanuts not included."
m/faster," If you consider hurtling along at insane speeds inches from the asphalt to be a tad eccentric, the riders of MotoGP may just fit the bill."
m/faster_2010," As films of this genre go, Faster is a middle-of-the-road offering, but those expecting something fast-paced and frenetic are likely to be disappointed."
m/faster_pussycat_kill_kill," The shoestring production values are so weak, the story is so lame and the acting is so bad that there's no mistaking this Pussycat for anything but what it is - a turkey."
m/fat," There is fearlessness here, and uncomfortable raw honesty, but there's also little opportunity to care about a man who pushes everyone, including us, away."
m/fat_albert," The overall approach is to throw preordained movie sequences (rap number, shopping spree) together and hope for the best."
m/fat_city, John Huston's 1972 restatement of his theme of perpetual loss is intelligently understated.
m/fat_girl," A solid coming-of-age story embracing a girl of 12 who is younger, fatter, and wiser (though less experienced) than her older sister."
m/fat_girls," An abysmal little conceit wholly lacking in originality, wit or technical style."
m/fat_kid_rules_the_world," Jacob Wysocki delivers an impressive character transformation from an almost insufferable sad sack to a powerhouse capable, and confident, enough to indeed rule his own world."
m/fat_man_and_little_boy, [Fat Man] is not resoundingly disastrous. That would imply a certain energy.
m/fat_sick_and_nearly_dead_2011," Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead makes it safe to eat your vegetables again."
m/fatal_beauty," Never quite hits the sweet spot in balancing action and humor. The film clunkily moves back and forth between them, rather than getting them to work in unison."
m/father-father-diary-of-one-week," This is real, solid, moving yet unsentimental stuff, and it's beautifully illustrated as well by Sandor Sara's camerawork with its nostalgic glimpses of the past."
m/father-of-invention," The screenplay, by Mr. Cooper and Jonathan D. Krane, is so sketchy that it feels like a hastily executed first draft."
m/father_figures_2017," Father Figures is a baffling film, one that never seems to ever get a handle on what it is or what it wants to be."
m/father_goose," One of Cary Grant's last pictures (he retired 2 years later) is one of his most commercially popular vehicles, with an Oscar-winning script by Peter Stone and Leslie Caron (who's half his age) as love interest."
m/father_hood," Most of the characters may be trapped in programmed spontaneity, but you can get a real lift out of the landscapes, the crisp sunlight splayed over gas stations and billboards, and the cannonade of '50s and '60s rock oldies."
m/father_of_my_children," a subtle and engaging family drama whose key concerns - absence, memory, continuity, and the light that shines through the darkness - just happen also to be amongst the constitutive preoccupations of cinema itself."
m/father_of_the_bride_part_ii, More of a sequel for sequel's sake than a justified continuation of the story.
m/father_of_the_year, A typically underwhelming Happy Madison production...
m/fathers_and_daughters, It's all rather implausible and hugely melodramatic as it milks ham-fisted histrionics from high soap opera. A pitiable excuse for a movie.
m/fathers_day, I did laugh. Williams and Crystal can make almost always make me laugh. But there is nothing in Father's Day that you can't find better somewhere else.
m/fathers_day_2011," It's gory, sick, depraved, funny, self-knowingly silly, and entertaining if you're in the right frame of mind."
m/fathers_little_dividend, It is not very often that the sequel to a successful film turns out to be even half as successful or rewarding as the original picture was.
m/fatima_2020, An inspired retelling of a century old story of a miracle in a small town in Portugal in 1917 has remarkable relevance for this year of a worldwide pandemic and the need to believe.
m/faults," Writer-director Riley Stearns shows promise, but his feature debut never comes together the way it should."
m/favela_rising," All in all, the movement turned out to be a godsend for Rio natives, but the film is merely a pep rally."
m/fay_grim," Hartley is a man with a lot to say about what's going on in the world these days, and while the trademark irreverence is very much intact, his venture into a much broader, international landscape proves more admirable than rewarding."
m/fear_and_desire," If Fear and Desire is uneven and sometimes reveals an experimental rather than a polished exterior, its over-all effect is entirely worthy of the sincere effort put into it."
m/fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas, This big-screen adaptation of the 1971 cult classic is a sure candidate for many worst ten film lists.
m/fear_city," Has a bitterness and cynicism that's grimily, perversely romantic."
m/fear_inc," A ""Scream"" knockoff, and an easily fatigued one at that."
m/fear_no_evil_1981, It's worth checking out if you're a big fan of '80s horror and have seen a lot of the essential titles already.
m/fear_of_fear," One of Fassbinder's crown jewels, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is as powerful as any film he ever made, despite its pedestrian premise."
m/fear_strikes_out," Mulligan does his best to get around Perkins' lack of baseball credibility, even laughably avoiding any shots of him fielding a groundball during the shortstop experiment."
m/fear_x," Fear X, like an impressionistic painting, is evocative in original ways."
m/feardotcom_2002," There are some fairly unsettling scenes, but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer."
m/fearless," It does, however, have two things going for it: outstanding punch-ups and Jet Li."
m/fearless_freaks, Beesley could have made just a fan movie... but here we get much more.
m/feast, John Gulager delivers with a horror-comedy reminiscent of the debuts by Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson.
m/feast_of_love," A beautifully photographed look at a dozen people in Portland, Oregon who find that love is far from an unmixed blessing."
m/feast_of_the_seven_fishes," Unlike the titular meal, there's not much substance to the nostalgic screenplay, even if the ensemble cast brings a heartfelt charm to the predictable material."
m/fed_up_2014, Fed Up is poised to be the Inconvenient Truth of the health movement. (Which makes sense - producer Laurie David worked on both.)
m/federal_hill," The movie has a good ear for the way the characters talk, dress, move and live; it's another Italian-American slice-of-life, well acted and directed."
m/feel_the_beat," While predictable, Feel the Beat is a solid effort in the family genre arena for Netflix. It's a tween recipe for success."
m/feel_the_noise," How do you say ""sappy Horatio Alger tale"" in Espaol?"
m/feeling_minnesota," Keanu Reeves does his usual impression of a man trying to get to grips with some really difficult arithmetic. Like him, the movie is dim-witted, bland to the taste and, all in all, rather a waste of space."
m/feels_good_man, Arthur Jones makes a blistering debut with this look at the man behind a meme.
m/felicias_journey," It took awhile to sink in, but I liked Felicia's Journey very much."
m/felix_and_meira," Offers compassion over certainty, even when circumstances call for an all-or-nothing commitment to a happily ever after."
m/felony_2013, A rich and engaging screenplay that borrows from the police procedural and blends it with the themes of a morality play makes Felony compelling viewing.
m/felt," It is certain that Felt is a beautiful film from one of the most exciting new directors working today, anchored by an astonishing performance by an artist without any previous acting experience."
m/female_perversions, Provides a bewildering collection of beautifully photographed images and thought-provoking set pieces.
m/female_trouble," Normal people should probably stay away, but twisted people and young filmmakers will find laughter, inspiration and joy here."
m/feminists_what_were_they_thinking, This visual anthology presents a collection of individual stories introducing some of the most influential feminists of the 1960s and '70s. It's not much more.
m/fences_2016," As you watch ""Fences,"" there's never a doubt that these lives matter, and that's a good and noble thing, but you're also aware (maybe too aware) of how much the movie itself wants to matter."
m/feral_2018," Director Young shoots his unimaginative opus with an eye of getting all the value of the gore makeup department's work on screen. In this respect, he does a bang-up job."
m/feral_2020," A bravura, multilayered lead performance by Annapurna Sriram anchors ""Feral,"" an intense drama about a young homeless woman's struggles as a harsh winter begins to bear down on Brooklyn."
m/ferdinand," Ferdinand buries the original story's message under frenetic action scenes and grating sidekicks, turning a classic tale into just another flat animated comedy."
m/fermats_room," And while some of the in-movie puzzles are relatively obvious, the flick as a whole proves to be sort of a puzzle in its own right."
m/ferngully_the_last_rainforest," Hardly an obstacle to the Disney machine, it is still plesant."
m/ferris_buellers_day_off, Writer-director John Hughes' snappy and thought-provoking film about adolescence.
m/festival_express, Long-lost documentary footage of '70s stars emerges and makes an oft-revisited era fresh and exciting.
m/festival_in_cannes, A guilty pleasure for diehard Francophiles who love the songs of Charles Trenet and Edith Piaf.
m/fetih_1453_2012," If you see only one Turkish epic about the siege of Constantinople this year, it should be Fetih 1453. Fetih has intrigue, dancing girls, hunky men, and a spunky heroine."
m/fever_pitch, Boilerplate rom-com autopilot. Mealy-mouthed Fallon could've been a Trekkie or a member of the Kiss Army for all this movie cares about baseball.
m/few_good_men," This is stirring, highly entertaining stuff, with superb performances all the way around and witty dialogue to keep it all moving."
m/fiddler_on_the_roof," It is hard not to feel spine tingles with numbers such as ""Sunrise, Sunset"", ""Miracle of Miracles"", or ""Do You Love Me?"""
m/fido, Andrew Currie's genial zombie comedy freshens up some familiar genre elements with considerable style and wit.
m/field_of_dreams," This film isn't just for baseball fans and soft touches. It's also for people who've experienced loss and want, just for a few minutes, to dream of regaining what was lost."
m/field_of_lost_shoes, it is a real pleasure to see a new film in which the heroes wear Civil War uniforms and not superhero spandex
m/fiend_without_a_face, Falls into the wave of horror productions that presented atomic radiation as the new boogeyman of the postwar era
m/fierce-people," Overall, it's an enjoyable effort, but not a positive triumph."
m/fifth_element, Besson surrounds his colorful characters and eccentric myths with a world of incredibly detailed richness. He fills every inch of every frame with imagination.
m/fifty_shades_darker," It's nice that the two photogenic leads are treating sex like a pleasurable activity rather than an onerous chore in this second entry, but overall, the film plays like an un-asked-for collaboration between the Hallmark and Playboy Channels."
m/fifty_shades_freed," Fifty Shades Freed ultimately authors its own most stinging rebuke, closing on an extended montage highlighting major moments and turning points from the trilogy. Tellingly, none of them come from this film."
m/fifty_shades_of_black," As a piece of cultural criticism, however, it painstakingly eviscerates nearly every scene in ""Grey"" and skewers latent sexism, classism and ludicrous sexual innuendoes, as well as the original's numerous plot holes."
m/fifty_shades_of_grey," ""The stylish and mostly satisfying film will be [a blockbuster], and deservedly so. Starring a vivacious Dakota Johnson and a game Jamie Dornan, Taylor-Johnson's erotic romance is a skillful distillation of James' first book."""
m/fiftyfifty, The first and last in a long series of Peter Weller / Robert Hays buddy comedies.
m/fight_club," A bracing, mesmerizing, bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable."
m/fighting," ""Fighting"" seems like a no-brainer project for Dito Montiel that he needed to get out of his system before he can move back into an emotionally rarefied world as complex as that of his first film."
m/fighting_69th," The Fighting 69th...may become a gushy tearjerker by its end, but you can't argue that its heart isn't in the right place."
m/fighting_temptations," There are a number of things it does right -- among them the hiring of poor, talented Jonathan Lynn to direct -- but none of them have even the potential to transcend the overwhelming inanity of the plot, which is one part cliche and two parts complete id"
m/fighting_tommy_riley," You may come to Fighting Tommy Riley for the boxing, but you'll find much more to ponder than left jabs and right hooks"
m/fighting_with_my_family," Fighting with My Family is just so good-hearted in nature that you can't help but get won over by its charm, however familiar it feels at times."
m/fightville_2011," If only there was more of Dustin and his colleagues' back story in Fightville, the fight film might have been a real knockout."
m/fill_the_void," A lesser filmmaker would have condescended to this world, but Rama Burshtein, an Orthodox woman herself, treats it with abiding respect. Her movie is a masterpiece."
m/filly_brown_2012," Unfortunately, the film is marred by a story, situations and stereotypical characters that strike all-too-familiar chords."
m/film_geek," Detailed in its affectionate mockery, the film captures the social isolation that befalls guys like Scotty but understates their own complicity on it."
m/film_stars_dont_die_in_liverpool," Improbably, while Annette Bening is incredible playing a fading Hollywood starlet in Paul McGuigan's ""Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool,"" it's her co-star, Jamie Bell, who might be the film's real secret weapon."
m/film_unfinished," It stands as a unique film-within-a-film, of significance for the historical value of the raw images, the memories they spur and internal evidence of how the Nazis staged scenes long assumed to be real."
m/filth_2013," Easily the best film adaptation of an Irvine Welsh novel since Trainspotting, it features a terrific central performance from James McAvoy as Bruce Robertson."
m/filth_and_wisdom," Madonna's feature directorial debut Filth and Wisdom seems of a piece with her previous work, in that it's in some way about Madonna herself hiding behind borrowed aesthetics."
m/final, Scott handles this enigmatic science fiction mystery with such gloomy restraint that it barely moves.
m/final_analysis," Far too much of the plot is like that of too many other films with very similar plot twists. Fans of classic thrillers, be warned."
m/final_conflict_omen_iii," The Final Conflict, from 1981, is really quite a bad movie, not actually awful enough to ever have achieved cult status..."
m/final_countdown," Best bad movie of the year. Best because it's carefully crafted, streamlined entertainment, bad because it's monumentally silly. We know it's awful, but we have fun anyway."
m/final_cut, A thinking person's picture whose only flaw is that the movie is never quite as good as its fascinating concept.
m/final_destination," The main problem is that Morgan and Wong don't seem to have a clear idea of what they want -- campy, schlocky slasher flick or moody, intelligent thriller -- and as a result they create neither."
m/final_destination_2, It's like Death and Ingmar Bergman sitting around playing Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.
m/final_destination_3," Whether conscious or not on the part of the filmmakers, the gory logic follows America's understandable desire to rationalize the effects of such physical violence that its invisible soldiers are suffering in Afghanistan and Iraq."
m/final_destination_5," A few inventive shocks are scattered throughout, but the rest is unremarkable madness, punctuated with a thriller-style conclusion that resembles another movie altogether."
m/final_destination_final_death_trip_3D," Percentage-wise, it's about 75% blood and 25% boring exposition and lax characterization"
m/final_exam_1981, Quite possibly the dullest slasher movie ever made.
m/final_fantasy_the_spirits_within," Plays more like an expanded short story than a full-blown novel, but it's still a game worth playing."
m/final_girl, One of the more entertaining and slick horror productions of the year...
m/final_portrait," In ""Final Portrait,"" Stanley Tucci, directing his first film in 10 years, takes the biopic to an even more exquisitely homespun level of miniature close-up."
m/final_score_2018," For a monstrously huge muscle man, Bautista sells his own mortality like his paycheck depends on it"
m/final_terror, The Final Terror isn't the slasher classic that Halloween and Friday the 13th are.
m/find_me_guilty," ... not funny... (and) irresponsible, picturing sociopathic killers and racketeers as clownish buffoons. What's next for Lumet and his crew; a musical comedy about John Gotti?"
m/finders_keepers_2015," Finders Keepers sees the tragedy in Whisnant's egomania. As he agrees to a tacky reality show, we realize he's peddling something more valuable than a leg - he's selling his soul."
m/finding_amanda," False, forced, familiar and often vulgar, especially in its language and depiction of certain characters."
m/finding_bliss," It is particularly painful to watch Sobieski -- whose unnervingly symmetrical, Botticelli face and supernatural poise can't help but hold the screen -- put through the paces of Davis's almost unbearably labored script."
m/finding_dory, It's neither as good as you hoped nor as bad as you feared.
m/finding_fela, This watchable but rather rote chronicle fails to find a compelling perspective on Kuti's significant life and legacy.
m/finding_forrester," While Finding Forrester is an average film that earns my average rating, the real disappointment is its ultimately disheartening theme that makes you wonder how it ever got made."
m/finding_kim, [Finding Kim] creates an (appropriately) organic and compelling portrait of a man who wants nothing more than to love himself and to be loved for being himself.
m/finding_nemo, A wonderfully engaging entertainment that is a visual masterpiece as well as a darn good tale with loads of humour and excitement to appeal to the child in all of us.
m/finding_neverland," The Depp magic, a fine cast and an inventive production preempts over-sentimentality and gives new meaning to Peter Pan for us adults in the crowd."
m/finding_steve_mcqueen, A slickly made piece of entertainment that's a good time out at the movies.
m/finding_vivian_maier, A penetrating doc about a photographer who became a celebrity only after her death.
m/finding_your_feet," Sure, it breezes by and there are smiles along the way, but the whole thing's about as novel as an old pair of socks worn every winter."
m/fine_mess, ...a thoroughly ludicrous but strangely enjoyable piece of work.
m/fingers, To see Fingers is to see Keitel perform as if he's doing dramatic improv. And that's absolutely fine as it is.
m/finians_rainbow, It's Fred Astaire's last musical and a sorry farewell.
m/finishing_the_game, Good-naturedly confront issues of racism and the stereotyping of Asian-American actors to question whether the bad old days are really so far in the past.
m/fire_at_sea_2016," The European migrant crisis has found its cinematic Piet in Fire At Sea, Italian director Gianfranco Rosi's powerful, at times shocking but also intensely human documentary."
m/fire_birds, Nicolas Cage and Tommy Lee Jones in a helicopter adventure. You've been warned.
m/fire_in_babylon," Fire in Babylon certainly has the right mood, but it seems unanchored and ambivalent to the details of its own subject."
m/fire_in_paradise," If Fire in Paradise is a terrifyingly effective movie, I can't help ask: effective at what? At times, it feels like voyeurism, exploitation, even like a snuff film. It feels ghoulish to watch it."
m/fire_in_the_sky," The X-Files could have done this story in 42 minutes flat, though in reality, it probably would have deemed it to boring to bother with at all."
m/fire_with_fire_2012," Spends much of its run time in neutral with actors either unprepared for the demands of the subgenre or locked in paycheck mode, stiffly working through tepid dialogue, tedious procedural events, and dull romantic yearnings."
m/fireball-500-thunder-alley-double-featureX," The ball games are so over-edited and CGI-embellished, it's like watching a hardcore version of Quidditch."
m/fired_up," There isn't anything special here, but ""Fired Up!"" is still a lot more fun than the adult romantic comedies Hollywood has trotted out so far this year."
m/firefox," Once the chases kick in and the invisible jet shows up, you'll have already withstood a healthy amount of yawns for your troubles."
m/firehouse_dog," The real question is: How does it go from setup A to inevitable payoff B? Answer: with humor, humanity and production values a cut above your average boy-and-his-dog movie."
m/firelight, What Firelight most tellingly lacks are riveting star performances to inevitably reel us in to its romantic absurdity.
m/firestarter, A whole lot of explosions punctuate a whole lot of blather ... and it's one of the most woefully miscast adaptations I've ever seen!
m/firewall," Beyond Paul Bettany's suave villain, there's not much to distinguish what amounts to an old-fashioned ""B"" picture, except perhaps its unusually overwrought score."
m/fireworks_wednesday," While not as brilliant as his 2012 Oscar-winning ""A Separation"" or 2009's ""About Elly,"" the film has the same qualities of compassion and suspense that have made Farhadi one of the world's most acclaimed directors."
m/first_blood, About a million miles better than the brainless sequels.
m/first_comes_love_2012," By the end, this HBO presentation feels like one of those uncomfortable evenings where you visit a friend, and they bore you to death with images of their ultrasound."
m/first_cow," While not a lot happens in First Cow by the standards of most two-hour narrative films, and some may wish for a less open-ended conclusion, the drama's rough-edged lyricism kept me rapt the entire time."
m/first_daughter," It's about as magical as a frog that doesn't turn into a prince when you kiss it, but still gives you warts."
m/first_deadly_sin," Forgettable Sinatra vehicle, beneath the Chairman's talents."
m/first_family, Disappointing acerbic political satire directed and written by Buck Henry.
m/first_kid, The film sags around mid-point and never completely recovers.
m/first_kill_2017, A decently executed but generic thriller ... most notable for advancing the dubious theory that the best way to help a child who is being bullied is to traumatize the heck out of him.
m/first_knight," ...lots of action and chivalrous pomp, but no magic."
m/first_love_2019," The Tarantino-style rollercoaster ride is as effortlessly enjoyable as ever, accentuating the director's lighter comic leanings over his bloodthirsty side."
m/first_man," A powerful experience that will inspire renewed awe of what Armstrong and his ilk did. It may not be a giant leap for filmmaking, but it's another small step for this filmmaker."
m/first_match," This narrative in First Match feels real, authentic and organic."
m/first_men_in_the_moon," Definitely unusual for a sci-fi project, the moon walkers' space suits don't have gloves, leaving their hands exposed to the harsh atmosphere."
m/first_position_2011, Bess Kargman's movie is imbued with a seriousness that sets it apart from typical 'competition docs.'
m/first_power," When you get right down to it, make-up and masks aren't nearly as scary as a human countenance hiding a black heart."
m/first_reformed," [Ethan] Hawke's performance is his most mature to date, a masterpiece of a man who cannot work himself out and yet is compelled to try."
m/first_saturday_in_may," The horses' quest for the Kentucky Derby is supposed to be the big-picture idea, but there isn't a whole lot of horse footage--too much standing around in stalls waiting."
m/first_sunday, Morgan butchers me every time with that overemphatic- delivery thing that makes incidental lines multiplex-leveling funny.
m/first_they_killed_my_father," The result is relentless and involving even when it stumbles. Jolie may not be a full-fledged auteur yet, but she unquestionably possesses a singular aesthetic that courses through her work and exists completely apart from her high-profile acting career."
m/first_to_the_moon," Not an instant classiclike ""Apollo 11,"" still an entertaining recollection of the memorable Apollo 8 mission and the men who flew it."
m/first_wives_club," The film is played as witchy, all-star vamping with a lethal sting. What makes its premise especially funny is that, at heart, it's no laughing matter."
m/firstborn_1984, This flawed but interesting Freudian melodrama spends about 70 minutes making points and the last 30 minutes losing them.
m/fish_called_wanda," It's a deliciously dishy comedy, but like sushi an acquired taste."
m/fish_tank," It's only her second feature film, but with Fish Tank, the British director Andrea Arnold demonstrates that she more than deserves her place in a Cannes competition lineup."
m/fish_without_a_bicycle," Not only does it take a solid thirty to forty minutes before the audience grows to like any of the characters or even care about Jules's situations, but one ends up more interested in the lives of Danny, Michael, and Ben."
m/fisher_king, Gilliam's pyrotechnics can't redeem the utterly predictable plot.
m/fishermans_friends," This gentle, sweet-natured comedy has warmth and a certain X factor of likability, helped by big-hearted performances from a cast including Daniel Mays and Tuppence Middleton."
m/fist_fight_2017," The path to the ending is littered with dick jokes, but Fist Fight makes the early hardships worthwhile."
m/fistful_of_dollars, The first (and nearly the best) of Eastwood & Leone's spaghetti westerns.
m/fists_of_legend_2013," The film is so generous in its characterizations that it's easy to overlook the fact that its hot-topic drama (bullying, economic marginalization, etc.) amounts to little more than padded lip service."
m/fitzcarraldo," ""Fitzcarraldo,"" the latest production from German director Werner Herzog, appears to be an advanced case of directorial self-absorption and self-glorification."
m/five," A beautifully realized, semi-pretentious, almost forgotten mini-classic of Atom Age after-the-bomb poetry and paranoia, 'Five' sketches its post-disaster environment with admirable economy; it now seems more like an 'art' film than a genre effort."
m/five_corners, Reminds you that you can still find small treasures in all the piles of low-budget cinematic junk that are out there.
m/five_dances_2013," Unfortunately, schmaltzy music and drab melodrama drag down the otherwise graceful moves of Five Dances."
m/five_easy_pieces," Nicholson at his angry, young man peak. Cynical, anti-authoritarian drama."
m/five_feet_apart," Five Feet Apart is not a great film, but it has greatness within its grasp thanks to Haley Lu Richardson."
m/five_graves_to_cairo, Wilder's second film in America is a Second World War espionage drama that is both witty and tense.
m/five_heartbeats," This is not only a biography with music, but also a thoughtful look at the way five young men from a poor but nurturing black neighborhood find success, and deal with it."
m/five_nights_in_maine, A believable character study that may not draw crowds but certainly challenges its two lead actors.
m/five_star, Keith Miller's modest drama Five Star is the kind of depiction the city sorely needs.
m/five_star_day, The script lacks the depth to transcend its cutesy gimmick and -- as with the misleading horoscopes that fuel the plot -- the film never approaches a five star level.
m/fixed_bayonets, The grunts 'talk the talk' and the action sequences are bloody good.
m/flags_of_our_fathers," A pointed exploration of heroism -- in its actual and in its trumped-up, officially useful forms -- the picture welds a powerful account of the battle of Iwo Jima... with an ironic and ultimately sad look at its aftermath for three key survivors."
m/flakes," One look at Aaron Stanford's chain-smoking, long-haired musician in a Hanes t-shirt and you know Flakes wants so badly to be hip."
m/flamenco_flamenco," Though stunningly shot, scored and directed, the almost wordless Flamenco pales as one musical number simply follows another."
m/flaming_star," A treasure trove of content for Presleyologists who interpret Elvis as a repository and reflector of America's conflicted and evolving attitudes toward youth, class, race and sex."
m/flammen_and_citronen," Writer-director Ole Christian Madsen delivers plenty of excitement, but misses the tragic resonance of Jean-Pierre Melville's recently re-discovered resistance masterpiece Army In The Shadows."
m/flannel_pajamas," These chatty, pedantic, annoying characters are simply not interesting enough to follow for five minutes, let alone over two hours."
m/flash_of_genius," Flash of Genius is a conventional crowdpleaser but not, I'm pleased to report, a shameless one."
m/flash_point," Finally -- with barely a half-hour left to go, Donnie Yen does his thing."
m/flashbacks_of_a_fool, It's a handsome picture but Joe's lack of evolution is unsatisfying.
m/flashdance, Well that was a stunning portrayal of the human condition.
m/flatliners," Flatliners is a heart-stopping, breathtakingly sumptuous haunted house of a movie that takes off where Dracula and Dante left off and CPR began."
m/flatliners_2017," Light on thrills, chemistry, or frights, Flatliners squanders a fun concept..."
m/flawless, A film that should be seen for the acting talent on board rather than its originality (or lack thereof).
m/fled, A generic buddy-buddy actioner that's not as slick as it thinks it is...pointless and forgettable
m/flesh," It's at least interesting. It isn't very good, though; if it hadn't come from New York under Warhol's sponsorship, we'd never have seen it."
m/flesh_and_bone," The film is depressing for some of the right reasons, and all of the wrong ones."
m/flesh_and_the_devil, Greta Garbo is the siren whose insatiable sexuality threatens to tear apart blood brothers John Gilbert and Lars Hanson in this overheated and melodramatic masterpiece.
m/flesh_for_the_beast, The script is obvious and cliched and the action is more disgusting than frightening.
m/fletch," Whenever the move threatens to work, there's Chevy Chase with his monotone, deadpan cynicism, distancing himself from the material."
m/fletch_lives," In this meager sequel, as in its popular predecessor, Chevy Chase demolishes every easy target in sight with a quip of the tongue. Some of the lines are funny, but after a while you just want to smack him."
m/flex_is_kings_2013," Putting aside the generic human interest, however, Flex Is Kings turns out to be shockingly deficient in its on-screen depiction of flexing."
m/flicka, A thoroughly uninspiring drama that ultimately buckles under Michael Mayer's weighty direction.
m/flickering_lights," A fun, rich, Danish multi-character study that scores courtesy of its fully-dimensional story, interesting dialogue and vivid characterizations."
m/flight_2012," A film of individually fine scenes that at best add up to a good, but not a great, movie."
m/flight_of_the_navigator, The special effects and gadgetry start to detract from a human story that is only vaguely hinted at.
m/flight_of_the_phoenix, This trim adventure saga doesn't waste any time assigning heartwarming characteristics or backstories. It gets your heart pounding the old-fashioned way; it is exciting.
m/flight_of_the_red_balloon," Hou Hsiao-hsien's trademark long takes call attention to the passage of time, and as such they're intimately attuned to his ongoing thematic interest in the bonds between the past, present, and future."
m/flightplan," So preposterous that you not only have to put your brain on hold but remove it from your skull, toss it to the floor and stomp it into insensibility."
m/flintstones_in_viva_rock_vegas," Forsaking story for sight gags and brief comedic moments, the film simply doesn't have enough of them to compensate for a lame and lackluster plot."
m/flipped," A somewhat leaden piece of work, its considerable charms nearly smothered by strange pacing and awkward staging."
m/flirt, It is more amusing to talk about than to experience.
m/flirting_with_disaster," [A] wonderfully mad odyssey of a movie, in which a man sets out to find his biological parents and winds up meeting more weirdos than Alice found down the rabbit hole."
m/flock_of_dudes_2016, The supporting characters are lifeless vessels in a movie that fails to break away from the traps of the hit-or-miss romantic comedy genre.
m/florence_foster_jenkins_2016," Aiming for the same kind of affectionate comic tone as The King's Speech, this gentle musical farce from director Stephen Frears hits more than a few flat notes, but still delivers gentle laughs and classy star performances."
m/flores_raras," Everything ultimately gives way to the stately, simplistic, inevitable pace of by-the-numbers biopics, from some woefully tinny, hit-and-run screenwriting to the usual difficulties surrounding the dramatization of an author's craft."
m/flow_for_love_of_water," Along with this sobering information, filmmaker Irena Salina's docu includes a distinct note of optimism that should help the film flow smoothly through the festival pipeline before eventually settling on DVD."
m/flower_2018," ""Flower"" is gifted with the charismatic, uber-magnetic personality of Zoey Deutch, a terrific force of nature who shines throughout."
m/flower_drum_song," The stage show was the usual product of the R. & H. collaboration... In the movie nothing of value has been eliminated, but nothing of interest has been added."
m/flower_of_evil," While it's not quite as satisfying as his underappreciated Merci pour le chocolat (2000), it's still nasty fun at the expense of the upper middle class."
m/flowers_in_the_attic_2014," Despite some retro fun at the beginning, which suggests the movie is going to be just as stilted and poorly written as we expect, there's no fun once we make it to the Foxworths."
m/floyd_norman_an_animated_life," A fine introduction to the life and work of Floyd Norman, but it merely scratches the surface."
m/flu," Buried beneath a melodramatic plot rife with unlikely coincidences and a love affair with fewer sparks than Robert De Niro's 1990 wooing of Jane Fonda in ""Stanley & Iris."""
m/flubber," One of Robin Williams's unspeaklably bad filler movies, and maybe one of his worst...and that's saying a lot."
m/flushed_away, Aardman has turned out a gloriously droll comic adventure that combines British wit with Yankee exuberance.
m/fly_away_2011," The lead performances are solid, as are the supporting actors, and Grillo is more than competent as a director. But Fly Away could have been stronger if its antiseptic visual style... had been more adventurous."
m/fly_away_home," It's a movie about dreamers that, for once, doesn't make you feel like a sap for buying into their dreams."
m/fly_me_to_the_moon," Fly Me to the Moon is an awkward mix of proficient 3-D animation, detailed technical recreation and strained storytelling that stalls on takeoff."
m/flyboys, A majestic tribute to the Hollywood war films of yesteryear ... worth the price of admission for the amazing aerial dogfights alone.
m/flying_down_to_rio," Pretty jerky, and not enough of Fred and Ginger; still, it has the ""Carioca."""
m/flying_leathernecks, The Flying Leathernecks packs a surprising amount of intelligent insight in with its nationalistic rally cry.
m/flying_scotsman, The film imparts a feel-good glow about the triumph of the underdog in adversity. And the training scenes against scenic backdrops should please tourist authority Visit Scotland.
m/flypaper_2011," May not be well executed, too broad for a script that obviously wants to be a very profane and twisted black comedy, but it's not without a silly charm."
m/fm," Embarrassing youth cult film, founded on the shaky premise that the staff of a ""progressive"" LA rock station have to fight their management for the right to play Olivia Newton-John."
m/focus_2014," Don't get me wrong, Focus definitely has its moments, but it's far from essential viewing."
m/fog, a plot that has been reworked into something resembling crudely made hash
m/follow_me_the_yoni_netanyahu_story," Stirring doc about one of Israel's great heroes, known particularly for rescuing hostages at Entebbe airport in Uganda."
m/follow_the_fleet," Not Fred and Ginger's best, but great Irving Berlin songs and dances"
m/followed," FOLLOWED isn't groundbreaking, but it's a darn good attempt at breathing new life into the found footage sub-genre."
m/following, It's brilliantly scripted and carefully planned. Yet it feels loose and improvised.
m/following_sean_2006, Following Sean is an almost shapeless film. But it's clever enough to know that its multiple reflections eventually reveal something profound.
m/food_chains," Perhaps Sanjay Rawal's most fascinating excursion into agriculture's dark side is the vineyards of Napa Valley, where the practically Eden-like scenery masks a dreary labor model."
m/food_inc, This stunning and vitally important doc pointedly shows how food industry lobbyists and lawyers basically took over the government agencies in charge of policing the very companies for whom they worked.
m/food_of_love, The film may venture into melodrama at times but it remains a moving portrait of the fragility of love and the cost of emotional closeness.
m/foolish, It's probably more reasonable to evaluate it as an Eddie Griffin concert film.
m/fools_gold_2008," The tone of Fool's Gold often feels as if Tennant & Co. were straining to create a live-action version of a Bugs Bunny cartoon, from the slapsticky physical humor to the constantly jaunty score."
m/fools_rush_in, A fun no-brainer that successfully casts a sweet romantic spell.
m/foosballers," It would have been easier to put together a pure biography of the sport, but you'd lose the excitement and enthusiasm these current masters all bring."
m/footlight_parade," Not the best of the Berkeley Warner musicals, but close."
m/footloose-2010," Footloose is a solid dance film that should find a new, appreciative audience with a younger generation that doesn't hold the '84 film in as high esteem as audiences over 40."
m/footnote," Highlight of Israeli cinema and winner of major award at Cannes Fest, Footonote is an intelligent and complex film that's effective as a ferocious father-son Freudian drama and poignant staire of scholarship and recognition."
m/footnotes_2017, The ending cheapens the main character and weakens the film's firm commitment to the importance of workplace organizing.
m/for-colored-girls-who-have-considered-suicide-when-the-rainbow-is-enuf," Though the text of the playwright's most affecting poems is virtually intact, Perry has unmistakably wrestled Girls into the same soap-opera mold of his earlier pics."
m/for_a_few_dollars_more, Not as good as the third sequel but still very entertaining.
m/for_a_good_time_call, Female buddy comedy makes the most of its phone-sex premise.
m/for_all_mankind," Apparently, grown men tend to act the same on the moon. One astronaut in mid-leap shouts ""Ya-hoo!"" If youre not smiling while you watch that, youve obviously never dreamed."
m/for_ellen," ""For Ellen"" is a small but exquisite film, beautifully observed and impeccably executed."
m/for_greater_glory," This drama styles itself as a cinematic epic, but its substance is as flimsy as a Jack Chick pamphlet."
m/for_love_of_the_game," Though uneven and occasionally sluggish, For Love of the Game is a surprisingly satisfying hybrid of an old-fashioned sports film and a contemporary date movie."
m/for_love_or_money_1993, Fox's good-guy charm elevates the material ... a lot.
m/for_me_and_my_gal, A nostalgic homage to vaudeville during the pre-WWI period that is no better than a routine musical.
m/for_my_father," A melodramatic morality play which sends the sobering message that suicide bombing does not pay, especially when you could just as easily seduce as splatter the sexy object of your detonation."
m/for_petes_sake_1974," If it never soars, at least it hums along with a cheery, sloppy abundance of goodwill."
m/for_the_bible_tells_me_so," The point that the homophobic right is picking and choosing which parts of the Bible to follow, and which verses to look at in the context in which they were written, is both terribly familiar and rudimentarily argued."
m/for_the_love_of_spock," A suitably affectionate, warm-hearted tribute. Catnip for Trekkies."
m/for_those_in_peril_2014," An experimental, poetic and moving exploration of grief and the toll it can take."
m/for_your_eyes_only, How one misses Goldfinger and the early Bond films in which the gadgets had more style and imagination.
m/forbidden_kingdom," An unabashedly innocent, wide-eyed movie selling the ultimate in martial arts fantasy. It delivers beautifully."
m/forbidden_planet, One of the visual highlights of '50s science fiction
m/forbidden_world, At certain points you'd be forgiven for thinking that you're watching a soft-core flick.
m/force_10_from_navarone, Entertaining war flick shadowed by superior original.
m/force_majeure_2014," Östlund has become an almost brutal satirist of his countrymen's foibles, presumptions and hidden prejudices, like Bergman with a more wicked streak."
m/force_of_nature_2020," Guns blaze and punches fly, but this storm simply doesn't surge."
m/force_of_nature_the_david_suzuki_movie," At best, Force of Nature restates an important message to a wider audience."
m/forces_of_nature, I kept waiting for the plot to kick in. And waited and waited and waited.
m/foreign_correspondent," There is plenty to enjoy here, including some impressive sets, especially those used for a harrowing plane crash at sea and the interior of a Dutch windmill."
m/foreign_parts," These are good people, rough-edged but pleasant, depicted while not romanticized."
m/forever_my_girl," A Hallmark movie would have at least given the female lead something of a personality and plot arc; this movie's all about the celebrity and his emotional journey, while the woman stands around like a prize waiting to be won, the Blessed Hometown Honey."
m/forget_me_not_2010," The ending of ""Forget Me Not"" conceals an emotional impact, sad and carefully orchestrated, but the film isn't very compelling."
m/forget_paris," This film needs any two of more appealing characters, bigger laughs, or a more sympathetic audience."
m/forgetting_sarah_marshall, Producer Judd Apatow looks to have scored another long-legged hit with Forgetting Sarah Marshall.
m/forgiving_dr_mengele_2006," The film's visual style is unremarkable and includes some really jejune transpositions and graphic matches the filmmakers use to bridge the past and present, but the woman's memories are vivid enough without such affectations."
m/forgotten," Car chases, special-effects jolts, and a socially irrelevant sci-fi story line lifted whole from The X-Files."
m/forks_over_knives, Not as entertaining as the docs of Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock but a must-see if we want to be healthy.
m/formosa_betrayed, All the heartfelt references to the 228 Massacre and the White Terror don't make this any more thrilling than a Wikipedia entry.
m/formula, The Formula is an intriguing thriller that raises many questions about business ethics and the moral bankruptcy of the very rich.
m/forrest_gump," Forrest Gump is a modern classic. It is epic in scope and effortlessly combines humor with pathos, like all the best movies do."
m/forsaken," Too familiar, too derivative and too inferior to its predecessors to have any reason to exist."
m/forsaken_2016," Forsaken - absolutely inessential, but fun none the less - is the Hollywood cowboy experience unadulterated."
m/fort_apache, Fascinating Western loaded with political and social commentary.
m/fort_bliss, The complicated psychological realities of army personnel require a tougher directorial treatment than the maudlin melodrama presented here.
m/fort_mccoy," The period details are so lovingly burnished in this uneven, if heartfelt, feature that for a while they threaten to overpower the story, which delves gently into a rarely explored aspect of the war."
m/fort_tilden," Fort Tilden, the debut feature co-written and directed by Sarah-Violet Bliss and Charles Rogers, showcases a satirical voice so dyspeptic it's almost endearing."
m/fortress_2_re_entry, The only thing that Fortress 2: Re-entry does succeed at is in being an awful movie.
m/fortune, Fascinating mess. Far better than its reputation suggests.
m/found_2014," Found takes its film-buff inspiration from the likes of early De Palma, Argento or Cronenberg. They are hard acts to follow, but Schirmer knows his stuff. Found is a singularly sick, sad story and announces the filmmaker as a notable talent."
m/found_footage_3d, One of the best 3D and one of the best found footage movies I've ever seen.
m/four_2013, Four goes believable places but avoids the trappings of traditional melodrama.
m/four_brothers, An unusual and uneven mix of genres that is both intriguing and rewarding.
m/four_christmases, It's not boring enough to be irritating and not funny enough to be entertaining. It's just not worth the trouble.
m/four_feathers," Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things, but the barriers finally prove to be too great."
m/four_for_texas," Aldrich's trademark violence bursts through only sporadically; otherwise the film comes across as a lazy, party-time effort for the stars."
m/four_hands, Smart writing and an unflinching relish when it comes to the scenes of violence make for a deftly handled genre piece.
m/four_horsemen_2012," The truth is, The Four Horsemen is really just another documentary digging over the financial collapse."
m/four_kids_and_it, Many adults watching along with their children may wish for a channel switch.
m/four_lions, The film's attempts to not just humanise but to make us like the bombers undermines the comedy.
m/four_minutes," Though not to be confused with Madonna's new single, Four Minutes is similarly built from clich."
m/four_musketeers, A grand mixture of adventure and comedy at the deft hand of Lester.
m/four_rooms, Four Rooms asserts itself as a goof so laboriously and aggressively that you almost feel pinned back in your seat.
m/four_weddings_and_a_funeral," A very funny and warm effort, Four Weddings strives to recapture the screwball sensibility of another era, succeeding to a surprising degree."
m/fourth_kind, Alien abductees are back and they are still idiots.
m/fox_and_his_friends," Here is a movie about characters who define themselves by their sexuality, but the movie doesn't. It takes the sexuality as a given, and defines them by their values and morals."
m/fox_and_the_hound," This is a pretty, relentlessly cheery, old-fashioned sort of Disney cartoon feature, chock-full of bouncy songs of an upbeatness that is stickier than Krazy-Glue and played by animals more anthropomorphic than the humans that occasionally appear."
m/fox_and_the_hound_2," Ainda que tecnicamente bem realizada e beneficiada pelo charme dos dois personagens-ttulo, esta  uma continuao desnecessria que abandona as mensagens do original e investe numa historinha boba que renda ao estdio um dinheiro fcil."
m/foxcatcher," Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum give superb performances in Bennett Miller's powerfully disturbing true-crime saga."
m/foxy_brown," As ever, Hill's potent direction and Grier's impressive screen presence bring this one home, and it was a hit."
m/fracknation," FrackNation starts from a bogus and willfully cordoned off point-of-view, and exhibits a desire to grind axes more than uncover truth."
m/fracture," An open-and-shut case becomes an elegantly framed battle of wits in Fracture, an absorbing legal thriller."
m/fractured," Brad Anderson can direct films like Fractured - his latest, out on Netflix - in his sleep. So as a fan of his work, it came as a bit of a letdown that the filmmaker appeared to have done just that."
m/fragments_2008, Vividly conveys the sorrow and suffering brought into the lives of five individuals by a man with a gun and his act of random violence.
m/frailty," The film plays out like a big-screen spin-off of ""The Simpsons"" starring Ned, Rod and Todd Flanders."
m/framing_john_delorean," It's a fascinating story, but the new documentary Framing John DeLorean...totally bungles the delivery."
m/frances," Lange is wonderful, and provides a searing, tremendous reason to see a film that would otherwise collapse under even a moment of analytical pressure."
m/frances_ha, Greta Gerwig's charismatic performance elevates Baumbach's serio comedy way above its modest nature and scale.
m/francis, These goofy comedies made more money than anyone expected and director Lubin went on to create another successful talking equine for television in Mr. Ed.
m/francofonia," While unlikely to appeal to those unwilling to convert to Sokurov's style, Francofonia is nevertheless an intriguing look at the Louvre."
m/frank_2014," Off-beat and punk-spirited, Sievey would no doubt approve of the tone and style of this movie."
m/frank_and_jesse, A poor by-the-numbers version of a James Brothers western.
m/frank_and_lola," For a directorial debut, Ross's film is admirably odd and hard to pin down. What first starts as a meet-cute love story slowly morphs into a globe-trotting thriller, only to settle down into something altogether more bizarre and disturbing."
m/frank_millers_sin_city_a_dame_to_kill_for," Rare indeed is the movie that features this many bared breasts, pummeled crotches and severed noggins and still leaves you checking your watch every 10 minutes."
m/frank_serpico," Viewers who'd prefer a bit more psychological probing may be left unsatisfied, but most will appreciate this chance to hang out with the legendary whistle-blower."
m/frankenhooker," Lorinz has some inspired moments of self-absorbed craziness as Jeffrey, and Mullen reveals a fine talent for physical comedy when Elizabeth returns as the lumbering, mind-blown Frankenhooker."
m/frankenstein_2015, Rose doesn't force his monster into a metaphor for anything; he just brings the narrative into the present day and allows it to resonate as one about the people who are shunted to society's outskirts and treated as less than human.
m/frankenstein_meets_the_wolf_man," It starts off really well, stalls a little toward the middle, goes bonkers for one really odd musical number, and then derails completely at the end."
m/frankenstein_must_be_destroyed, One of the finest of the seven entries in Hammer's Frankenstein cycle.
m/frankensteins_army," Like the monster evoked by the film's title, everything feels tacked together."
m/frankensteins_monsters_monster_frankenstein, The main benefit of its brevity is that you can fit in multiple viewings without breaking a sweat-something wholeheartedly recommended.
m/frankenweenie_2012," I don't think Burton has ever connected with his audience like this... ['Frankenweenie'] is overflowing with passion, creativity and genuine heart."
m/frankie_and_alice," This movie, with its flashbacks to past sins and traumas, rests squarely on Berry, a mesmerizer who makes every moment count."
m/frankie_and_johnny_are_married," The pleasant surprise is that it's often funny and unexpectedly engaging, in large part because Pressman knows better than to ask you to feel too sorry for the fictitious 'Pressman' and 'Chess.'"
m/frantz," A mostly dreary and heavy-handed affair that examines the damaging cost of nationalism and the toll that war takes on winners and losers, survivors and casualties alike."
m/freak_show, That it unfolds with a near-complete absence of finesse or subtlety probably won't matter a whit to a target audience weaned on Glee.
m/freakdog," inevitably derivative (and the faux-American accents from the mostly Irish cast grate), but it makes for a heady enough cocktail."
m/freakonomics," By the end, don't be surprised if you are still asking yourself what, exactly, the definition of freakonomics is."
m/freaks, Browning's film really works to get the audience to view things from the freaks' perspective
m/freaks_2019," [Kolker's] semi-improvised performance couldn't be any more authentic and she's well matched with Hirsch, drawing on his own parental experience, as her conflicted and overprotective father."
m/freaky_friday, Plays the obvious gags in ways both surprising and imaginative.
m/fred_armisen_standup_for_drummers," This is fairly subtle work, the kind that also reminds you that we're living in a big, complex country where even people in neighboring states talk differently."
m/fred_the_movie," The slightly surreal, teen romance plot might have worked if the lead character wasn't so deeply, deeply irritating."
m/fred_wont_move_out, There is recognizable pain throughout Ledes' film. Yet it never pushes through to anything beyond a surface portrait.
m/freddy_got_fingered, It's the ultimate experiment in post-narrative filmmaking! It's a piece of crap! It's both!
m/freddy_vs_jason, A lively concoction of genre in-jokes with elements that'll please fans of both murderous characters.
m/freddys_dead_the_final_nightmare, Full of bluster and gimmickry. Does anyone involved even remember the original movie?
m/free_angela_and_all_political_prisoners, A nicely balanced film that surprisingly doesn't aim to lionize Davis nor to vilify Ronald Reagan and the FBI.
m/free_birds_2013, A more than worthy (and weird) holiday diversion for the whole family.
m/free_china_the_courage_to_believe," Earnest, interesting, but not wholly satisfying treatment of China's Falun Gong movement."
m/free_enterprise," When compared to other entries from the recent crop of new filmmakers crafting movies about their lives, Free Enterprise stands out as one of the most entertaining and least pretentious efforts."
m/free_fire," Free Fire is a relentless genre assault of bullets, laughs and personality, like an pseudo action movie that cranks intensity to 11 and rips off the knob."
m/free_men, A satisfying wartime espionage drama focused on little-noted intersections between Arabic emigres and the French Resistance.
m/free_radicals," An intelligent, viscerally intellectual exercise in ensemble acting and associative montage, enlivened with some terrific visual and dramatic ideas."
m/free_ride_2013," The result, while sincere and nicely evoked, feels choppy, familiar and, despite the script's heavily stacked deck - and a few harrowing episodes - lacks sufficient momentum."
m/free_samples," You gotta sample Free Samples! It's delicious, quirky goodness."
m/free_solo, This breathtaking doc about free solo phenom Alex Honnold will inspire both amateur and armchair climbers.
m/free_state_of_jones," The movie doesn't entirely escape an arid, educational quality, coming off mostly as a curious hybrid of the best and the regrettable in right-side-of-history cinema."
m/free_the_mind," Larger ideas of a mind-body connection, and mentions of brain research, are not treated in an inspiring or deeply informative way."
m/free_the_nipple, This is kind of didactic topical movie that distributes its rhetoric evenly between characters with clear distinction as to who's playing devil's advocate to the other one's points.
m/free_willy, Don't be put off by the dumb title. Free Willy has its heart in the right place.
m/free_willy_2_the_adventure_home_1995, A dreary retread of what wasn't a very good picture in the first place.
m/free_willy_3_the_rescue, There is a majesty to whales that the second Willy movie trivialized. Part three returns to some of the human elements that made the first movie so good.
m/freebie_and_the_bean," Rush's movie can be enjoyed as kitsch, but it plays better as an early stab at a Lethal Weapon-style movie, effortlessly combining violence and humour."
m/freedom_writers, In Freedom Writers Hilary Swank uses neediness to fine effect in a film with a strong emotional tug and smartly laid foundation.
m/freedomland," Even if you're into the Price school of screenwriting, Freedomland pushes its luck."
m/freeheld_2015," Peter Sollet's fact-based drama couldn't have come at a better time to remind the world how far equality has come in America, and how fresh the fight still is. Instead, Freeheld comes across as shockingly trite."
m/freejack," The real casualties in this easy resort to smashing up the set are the actors, including Jagger and Estevez."
m/freestyle_2000, Makes for an interesting close-up on an art form whose intricacies could all too easily go unnoticed.
m/freetown," A dawdling, flat account of African missionaries on the run from rebels that takes forever to get going and even longer to arrive."
m/freeze-frame," Uma premissa original e inteligente que é muito bem explorada pelo estreante diretor John Simpson e pelo comediante Lee Evans, surpreendentemente eficaz em um papel dramático."
m/freezer_2014," McDermott having a grand old time here as a Willis-style wiseass, while the production organizes levels of punishment for the leading man, creating a passably entertaining B-movie."
m/french_connection, Still one of the coolest cop flicks you'll ever see.
m/french_connection_ii," More conventional than its predecessor, but it's still unconventional by the cop thriller standard set by a wash of anonymous, lesser films. [Blu-ray]"
m/french_lieutenants_woman," Featuring an exalted amount of talent in front of behind the camera, it is also a work of supreme intellectual artifice, and one of the most excitingly formidable examples as concerns the possibilities of adaptation and the concept of filmmaking."
m/frenzy," Even though this is a quality film, for the first time, I came away from a Hitchcock movie with a bad taste in my mouth."
m/frequency," An implausible, but entertaining fantasy that taps into one of man's primal fantasies: the what-if scenario."
m/fresh," I left Fresh with my mouth literally hanging open, affected to the bone by a spectacular piece of storytelling."
m/fresh_2010," Ultimately a necessary genealogy of the ""we are what we eat"" cliche, a welcome reminder of how eating is the inadvertent daily exercise of politics."
m/fresh_dressed, A snazzy docu portrait of hip-hop's influence on the fashion world.
m/freshman_orientation," Writer/director Ryan Shiraki certainly adds some youthful exuberance to his debut feature film, but it's all wasted on a tremendously misguided and exhaustively dim screenplay"
m/frida," Though Frida offers only what feels like a surface level recap of its subject's life, and as a result feels rather light on substance, Taymor ensures that it has style to burn."
m/friday, An energetic and genuinely funny low-budget flick. This is why we wade through all the really bad ones; to find the unexpected pieces of comedy gold.
m/friday-the-13th-the-final-chapter," Opening line of film -- 'I don't want to scare anyone, but Jason is still out there' -- is film's only laugh."
m/friday_after_next, Cranks up an impressive amount of energy considering that it's the third installment.
m/friday_night_lights, The film lets you get caught up in the excitement of this religion and the addictive nature of those stadium lights.
m/friday_the_13th_part_1, There's a hollow cracking sound as the killer's identity is divulged. It's your jaw hitting the floor.
m/friday_the_13th_part_2," This movie is a cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead teenager genres; about two dozen movies a year feature a mad killer going berserk, and they're all about as bad as this one."
m/friday_the_13th_part_3," Friday the 13th was dreadful and took in more than $17 million. Friday the 13th Part 2 was just as bad and took in more than $10 million. Friday the 13th Part III is terrible, too."
m/friday_the_13th_part_5_a_new_beginning," The spiciest entry in the series, it boasts the most T&A, an incredible double homicide, a witty reference to A Place in the Sun, and yokels chopping chickens."
m/friday_the_13th_part_6_jason_lives, A sly sense of humor helps alleviate the tedium of the 6th go-round.
m/friday_the_13th_part_7_the_new_blood," Goodness knows the writer, director and actors didn't expend much effort. We won't bother mentioning that the acting and dialogue are atrocious, like they always are."
m/friday_the_13th_part_8_jason_takes_manhattan," As most people had already realized long before, Jason just wasn't scary anymore."
m/friday_the_13th_prequel," Jason Voorhees is resurrected once again, this time as a cranky and violent marijuana farmer."
m/fried_green_tomatoes," Mary Stuart Masterson, as Idgie, keeps us guessing. One of Hollywood's best young actresses, she fairly sets off sparks as the tomboy next door, a distaff Huck Finn."
m/friend_request, This militantly appalling horror film offers so much to complain about that it hardly seems worth taking offence at its interpersonal politics
m/friends_with_benefits," Though Friends with Benefits eventually loses that battle against clichs, that fight is the most interesting thing about the movie by far."
m/friends_with_kids, A romantic comedy that takes time to find its groove but steadily accumulates heart and humor.
m/friends_with_money, Holofcener has an uncommonly keen eye for the nuances of awkward public discourse between people of varied social status.
m/fright_night_2011," Slick popcorn horror, faithful to the fun and flair of the original."
m/fritz_the_cat," Despite the somewhat meandering nature of its plot, the film's underlying messages about social hypocrisy on all levels still has a strong bite to it, and it remains one of the more creative and daring forays in feature-length animation."
m/frogs, A 'nature strikes back' environmental horror film and not a film about the French as some of you wiseguys might have thought.
m/frogs_for_snakes," Not a film so much as a filmed idea. That could be interesting, but alas it is a very bad idea."
m/from-other-worlds," There are a few funny jokes scattered throughout, but the halfhearted direction and clunky script are underscored by performances that feel like they belong in community theater."
m/from-time-to-time," Movies are supposed to whisk you away, to make you get lost in their stories. I never got lost in From Time to Time because I was continually aware of the pieces being assembled before me."
m/from_beyond, The tone is so ludicrous and deadpan that it practically invites a late night audience to laugh as well as scream.
m/from_dusk_till_dawn, What we have here in From Dusk Till Dawn is Pulp Fiction with teeth.
m/from_dusk_till_dawn_2_texas_blood_money," Pior do que o ridculo roteiro, s mesmo a insistncia do pssimo diretor Scott Spiegel em usar cmeras subjetivas absurdas durante todo o filme."
m/from_dusk_till_dawn_3_the_hangmans_daughter, Melhor que o segundo filme - o que no quer dizer muita coisa.
m/from_hell," An artsy slasher film that makes good use of its large budget for costumes, production design, and surgically graphic corpses"
m/from_justin_to_kelly," It's sad that after Moulin Rouge and Chicago worked so hard to resurrect the musical, From Justin to Kelly had to go and kill it all over again."
m/from_noon_till_three," The movie opens unsteadily and takes too long to close, but the things that happen between noon and three give us new ideas about Bronson's possibilities."
m/from_nowhere," Even at its most mechanistic ... From Nowhere largely avoids preachiness and sanctimony, preferring to wrestle with the real world in all its stubborn complexity."
m/from_paris_with_love, Nowhere near as fun as that premise probably sounds.
m/from_prada_to_nada_2011," Simply put, From Prada To Nada is Sense And Sensibility For Dummies, as set in modern-day Los Angeles."
m/from_russia_with_love," It's one of the franchise's highlights, and if the dated action can be forgiven, a cracking cold war story."
m/from_the_land_of_the_moon, The ingredients of an old-fashioned romantic weepie are given class and conviction by director Nicole Garcia whose elegant restraint helps to ground the more fanciful elements in some sense of reality.
m/from_the_terrace, A tolerable (if interminable) piece of mediocrity from 1960.
m/from_up_on_poppy_hill, it's a gem of classical 2D imagery that stands out in a world turned upside down by the digital revolution.
m/front," The Front may not be all you need to know about the 1950's blacklist tragedy, but it's certainly one of the finest films ever made on the subject."
m/front_cover_2016, The very few instances where stereotypes are challenged are forced and didactically delivered.
m/frontera_2014," Frontera is a showcase for actors: Ed Harris, in particular, does something we've seen him do before -- play the laconic man of principle -- but he's so good at it, you warm right up to his rhythms."
m/frontier_2007, A patently over-the-top piece of gore-drenched survival horror. Very familiar but very fun.
m/frontrunners," The film is clearly intended as a microcosm of the US presidential elections, although the students' cutthroat tactics are bush-league in comparison."
m/frost," With its gorgeous cast and sharp HD lensing, Gotham-based production looks polished and makes good use of the city."
m/frostnixon," Although it all pays off in a potent and revelatory final act rife with insights into the psychology and calculations of power players, the initial stretch is rather dry and prosaic."
m/frozen_2013," Given that it's a Disney cartoon, you probably already know how it ends, but what's interesting about Frozen is that you may not predict how they're going to get there. And for children's animation, that's a wilder ride than we usually get."
m/frozen_ii," Frozen 2 doesn't reach the heights of the first film, but with more complex emotional themes and better songs, there's still plenty of Disney magic."
m/frozen_river," A gripping, beautifully written drama suffused with authenticity."
m/fruitvale_station," One has the sense of a man being slowly, surely written back into being."
m/fubar_balls_to_the_wall, The FUBAR films are an experiment - can two knuckleheads really get by doing nothing but partying and drinking beer? And is it believable? You bet it is.
m/fugitive_kind, An almost unbelievably sluggish and uninflected adaptation of Tennessee Williams' searing Orpheus Descending.
m/fugitive_pieces," Though pretentious and structurally problematic, Podeswa's tale of a Holocaust survivor is ambitious and occasionally lyrical and powerful, adding another honorable panel to the growing body of works on the catastrophic phenomenon."
m/full-tilt-boogie," Longer than the movie whose construction it documents, this is nonetheless an entertaining (if sprawling) look behind the scenes."
m/full_battle_rattle_2008," The film is freaky, amusing, and sickening in equal measures -- part fly-on-the-wall vérité, part multiple-perspective Altmanesque tragicomedy."
m/full_frontal, One of the worst movies of the year. ... Watching it was painful.
m/full_metal_jacket," Full Metal Jacket, ice and wildfire, order and chaos, is intellectual war, hard thought."
m/full_monty, The Full Monty is feel-good comedy with none of the pejorative hints of innocuous blandness that term so often implies.
m/full_moon_in_paris," Full Moon in Paris, the fourth in the series, is bleaker than any of its predecessors."
m/fulltime_killer, The dreamy flow back and forth through time and memory and the shifting point of view across four narrators casts the sleek stylistics of 21st-century Hong Kong cinema between tortured existential heroics and tall tale.
m/fun_and_fancy_free," Mickey and the Beanstalk is the classic here, and worth the price of the DVD."
m/fun_in_acapulco," A pleasant diversion full of sun, music and beautiful girls."
m/fun_mom_dinner," Salty, sweet and fun to chew over - sort of like taffy, but not so hard on the dental work - Fun Mom Dinner is a palatable addition to that growing subgenre of bawdy, female-centric comedies."
m/fun_size," A smart and emotionally satisfying slice of wish fulfillment, tracing how a threatened family finds harmony."
m/fun_with_dick_and_jane, Fun With Dick and Jane is exactly that - a bit of holiday fun.
m/funeral_in_berlin, the least interesting of the [first] three Harry Palmer films... Mostly due to a lack of character development and the numerous double-crossings make the plot difficult to follow.
m/funeral_kings," Funeral Kings is confident and controlled and, with an unabashed vulgarity underscoring everything, about as pure a piece of movie memory as I can name."
m/funny_about_love," Funny About Love provides an opportunity to spend 101 minutes in the presence of the most cloying, inane and annoying dialogue I've heard in many a moon, punctuated only by occasional lapses into startling bad manners."
m/funny_bones, Funny Bones is entertaining and absorbing for what it is. But what it isn't could have really been something.
m/funny_face, Funny Face...teams Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn in a delightfully balmy romance.
m/funny_girl, Barbra Streisand was the perfect choice to play the Florenz Ziegfeld-era comedienne Fanny Brice.
m/funny_lady," Vibrant music, some infidelity in Funny Girl sequel."
m/funny_people, It just about compensates for its many indulgences with typically warm humour and a knockout lead performance from Adam Sandler which shows a deepening maturity in the actor that could land him awards attention.
m/funny_story," FUNNY STORY has a few minutes of humor, but it takes more than that to make a ""funny story."
m/funny_thing_happened_on_the_way_to_the_forum, A funny thing happened on the way to Hollywood: A good musical-comedy lost much of its fizz.
m/fur," The film is visually spectacular, overlapping worlds of fantasy and reality until we're never quite sure what's real and what's not."
m/furious_7," There are indeed faster and, sadly, significantly more furious movies in the Fast & Furious canon."
m/furlough_2018," ""Furlough"" is funny and active, remaining compelling while it details small acts of connection and evasion."
m/fury_2015," Unflinching, unsentimental and never unconsidered, ""Fury""'s rumbling, metal-clad exterior has real humanity, fragile and frightened, captured and caged deep within it."
m/futurama_the_beast_with_a_billion_backs," For all its missteps, Beast remains funny and clever throughout."
m/futurama_the_movie_benders_big_score," Toss in the aliens, the last act space battle, the constant references to other sci-fi signposts, and the solid voice acting, you've got a flawless stand alone package that perfectly preserves everything that made the series a woefully unappreciated gem."
m/future_weather," When a movie shows a couple of bright kids excited about a mussel, it's hard to say no."
m/future_world," Franco and Cheung's unorthodox approach of directing almost the entire film in random, nomadic Steadicam shots with wobbly zooms alienates the simplistic plot."
m/futureworld, Fine sequel to 'Westworld' has robots replacing humans.
m/fx, The film is as much a demonstration of various kinds of special effects as it is about them.
m/fx_2_the_deadly_art_of_illusion, Fairly uninspired sequel to a movie that didn't really need one.
m/gabbeh, There is hardly a composition in the film that couldn't be extracted and framed.
m/gabrielle_2013, Writer-director Louise Archambault's neatly affirmative denouement is at odds with the more uncertain reality occurring at the edges of the film's drama.
m/gacy," We barely learn a thing about [Gacy], other than the fact that his father abused him and he hates his wife."
m/gaga_five_foot_two, Anyone who doesn't have a Little Monster's encyclopedic knowledge might feel a little emotionally lost.
m/gags_the_clown_2018," As someone who is always up for more clown-based horror hijinks, Gags feels like something of a letdown; there is a genuinely good idea at its core, but his approach never really works for me as a viewer."
m/gainsbourg_a_heroic_life," Both evocative and faithful in its depiction of the famed French singer's lascivious life, Gainsbourg (vie heroique) offers up a feast of memorable chansons and an almost endless parade of drop-dead-gorgeous muses."
m/galaxy_quest," The premise is the best thing about the movie, but it's such a dandy premise that it is almost enough."
m/galveston," A sort of modern film noir peopled by flawed figures with bleak prospects, one that offers a pervasively downbeat ambience but not much dramatic insight."
m/gambit_2014," [A] leaden, lethargic affair, based on a 10-year-old script by the Coen brothers that feels like a first draft at best."
m/game_change_2012," Game Change might have felt fresh had it hit the airwaves in 2010, but in 2012 it's just more of the same."
m/game_night_2018," A lively and exciting enough romp to watch unfold, even if it is completely frivolous."
m/game_of_death_2020, what these youths are discovering is their involuntary place in a selfish system gamed against the innocent... great to see so many ideas & all that youthful promise (of frankly annoying characters) cut short to a mere 73 minutes. Oh the humanatee!
m/game_over_man," At all turns, Game Over, Man! is a cynical vehicle for the kind of outdated humor that fell out of style more than a decade ago."
m/game_six," Hoffman makes impressive use of his low budget, thanks to a talented cast, an atmospheric soundtrack by Yo La Tengo, and the general feeling of confidence that a veteran director can bring to a project."
m/gamer," This was never going to be much, but it could have been more than this."
m/gandhi," An epic biopic, over three hours in length, Gandhi captures the spirit of the man and his struggles."
m/gandhi_my_father," There's nothing here to seriously damage Gandhi Sr's reputation; if anything, he is made more human."
m/gang_related," Jim Kouf has managed to create a low-budget cop story that not only features a sterling cast, but also manages to entertain for two hours straight."
m/gang_that_couldnt_shoot_straight, The gangster comedy spoof based on the best seller 1968 novel by Jimmy Breslin tanks.
m/gangs_of_new_york," In trying to create the ultimate vision of his city, Martin Scorsese has created a masterpiece."
m/gangster-no-1," Yet another genre exercise, Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title."
m/gangster_land," The ideal audience for ""Gangster Land"" would be someone who's never seen ""The Untouchables"" or ""Boardwalk Empire"" ... or, heck, even ""Guys and Dolls"" or ""Bugsy Malone."""
m/gangster_squad_2012," A movie that plays out like the most basic of 1950s cop shows, except with a double dose of ultra violence."
m/ganja_and_hess," Whether by accident or design, [Gunn's} creating a new kind of artistic expression out of imagery that had been used to titillate and exploit, a sort of pushback against the producers who wanted him to make a ""black vampire movie."""
m/garage_days," A movie of shopworn riffs and borrowed noise, dressed up with considerable surface polish and glam production values."
m/garbo_talks," It's a misfire, where seemingly every move Lumet made was a misstep."""
m/garden_party," A fatally fractured, disconnected mosaic of unappealing, marginal Hollywood types haphazardly interconnecting."
m/garden_state, [Writer/Director] Braff deftly avoids Author Intrusion by understanding how to imbue his ideas into the fabric of his characters.
m/gardens_of_stone, The most important missing ingredient is Mr. Coppola.
m/gardens_of_the_night, Good acting and sincere direction by Damian Harris act as beacons to light the haunting corridors of an underworld spook house.
m/garfield," ""Garfield's"" problems start with its very concept. This film should never have been made, and those involved with its production likely know it."
m/garfield_2," Cat fanciers and five-year-olds will have a great time, but everyone else will likely find themselves wishing they'd buried this one in the litter box."
m/gas_food_lodging," The story of this fractured family has a ring of authenticity, but lacks the hands of an artist to shape it into something more profound and affecting."
m/gasland," There's an acerbically straightforward, old-fashioned muckrake gurgling with righteous pugnacity beneath the mannered surface of Josh Fox's Gasland."
m/gaslight," Effective thriller, but inferior to the British original."
m/gaslight_1940," The husband is played by Anton Walbrook, who is far more sinister and emotionless than Charles Boyer would be in the later version."
m/gate," I saw this movie in the theater in 1987 and thought it was pretty bad back then; it's still pretty bad, but the visual effects hold up pretty well."
m/gate_of_hell," It's a visually rich movie, but in retrospect rather slight in the canon of Japanese filmmaking."
m/gaten_ragnarok," In the end, any and all potential B-movie fun is extinguished by Ragnarok's depressingly listless anonymity."
m/gates," The documentary is pretty much what you'd expect: Two decades of ignorant contempt, followed by the city finding it was really surprisingly fond of 'The Gates.'"
m/gates_of_heaven_1980, It is Morris' selection of people and their statements that make Gates of Heaven required viewing for documentary aficionados.
m/gator," Good-ol'-boy humor is my least favorite form of masculine love-antagonism in the cinema, but even a generous-minded peckerwood ought to weary rapidly of the snorting, yokking, hooting interplay..."
m/gattaca," It's firmly rooted in Hawke's masterful humanity, making this less a sci-fi epic than a simple (and simply wonderful) lesson in humanity and the direction in which one hopes it's not heading."
m/gaudi_afternoon, The offbeat cast and gorgeous Barcelona locations can't quite make up for the thinness of the mystery and forced quirkiness of the characters and their tangled relationships.
m/gauguin_voyage_to_tahiti, The love triangle as depicted here isn't a strong enough structure to support either a traditional three-act configuration or a looser association of ideas connected to Gauguin and his life.
m/gauntlet," It is a movie without a single thought in its head, but its action sequences are so ferociously staged that it's impossible not to pay attention most of the time."
m/gay_divorcee, Aimed at cheering up a Depression audience--which it does do with animated song and dance numbers.
m/gay_sex_in_the_70s, The film is packed with fantastic archival footage.
m/gayby, It's the most pleasant surprise I've had so far at this year's festival.
m/gbf_2013, A smart and frothy teen farce for anyone who has ever felt that the flag they've been waving has wrapped itself around their throat and is cutting off their air supply.
m/gebo_and_the_shadow, The devastating yet logical closing scene is delicious in its poetic symmetry and irony.
m/gedo-senki-tales-from-earthsea," Something of a disappointment, given Studio Ghibli's track record, although Le Guin fans can probably go ahead and add an extra star."
m/gemini_2018," Transitions into an at once sleazy and slick genre thriller, enigmatic without being alienating. There's suspense in the movie's central mystery, enough to sustain the characters Katz has created."
m/gemini_man_2019," The disappointing end result feels less than the sum of the talents involved, a weak script and thin high-concept plot only just held together by smart visual wizardry."
m/gemma_bovery," A transmogrified Flaubert, recast, upturned and rich with observational and satirical contemporary details."
m/general-orders-no-9," The film haphazardly follows the self-destructive path by which, in its own words, ""deer trail becomes Indian trail becomes county road becomes interstate."""
m/general_education_2012," When the biggest name in the movie is Janeane Garofalo, why waste her in an extraneous, laugh-free side role as the protagonist's neglected housewife mother?"
m/general_idi_amin_dada_autoportrait," Idi Amin Dada is not a particularly good documentary, but it's often a fascinating one."
m/generals_daughter," The General's Daughter is a blandly acted, dully written, gratuitously grisly, coincidence-filled potboiler that takes the obvious road whenever it has a choice."
m/generation_iron," ""Iron"" opens a window to an exclusive club and gives valuable insight into a small, dedicated and proudly unique community."
m/generation_um," Despite strong performances from Keanu Reeves, Bojana Novakovic and Adelaide Clemens, Generation Um... doesn't give us enough of a story to keep us fully invested throughout its running time."
m/genius_2016," Genius nudges its nose, or maybe just the brim of its fedora, ahead of a lot of prestige biopics."
m/genius_on_hold_2011, A movie that underscores that the winners and losers of some battles of capitalism aren't always confined to a single generation; its shadows are long ones.
m/gentlemans_agreement," A seriously flawed, groundbreaking work that's more important for what it tries to do than for what it actually does."
m/gentlemen_broncos, Whether Hess has made these things awful on purpose or not seems somewhat irrelevant. They're still awful.
m/gentlemen_prefer_blondes," It's complex and hilarious, and not hilarious at the expense of the film's two female leads."
m/geography_club_2013," While a perfect consciousness-raiser for those 16 and under, for those of you who've already started shaving regularly, this might be more of a wobbly entertainment."
m/george_harrison_living_in_the_material_world," Scorsese's film suggests that alone in the Beatles, and perhaps alone in pop's premier league, Harrison was an authentic spiritual figure. For Harrison fans, this is a treat."
m/georgia_rule," The subject matter is grim, the relationships are gnarled, the worldview is bleak, and, at any given moment, you suspect someone's going to be hit with a pie."
m/geostorm," This is a movie where the special effects are relied on so heavily that acting, dialogue and wardrobe do not matter."
m/geralds_game, 'Gerald's Game' Hits 'Misery' Levels of Cringe-worthy Tension.
m/gerhard_richter_painting," In the first documentary he's agreed to in fifteen years, Corinna Belz eschews voiceover narration in favour of a low-key, fly-on-the-wall look at the man in his studio painting."
m/gernika, One of the most exciting and classic recent productions from Spain. [Full review in Spanish]
m/geronimo_an_american_legend," A gorgeously shot, fair-minded Western that honors Geronimo and the Apaches, but doesn't demonize the U.S. Cavalry. Vastly underrated and far superior to Dances With Wolves."
m/gerontophilia, An enjoyable but surprisingly tame film about a provocative topic.
m/gerry, Gus Van Sant is obviously rebelling against Hollywood-style films but going to the other extreme is not the answer.
m/gerrymandering, Arnold Schwarzenegger appears as the rare politician who supports reform in this timely expos of how our democracy has slipped off its tracks.
m/get_a_job_2016," Not only is this ensemble unemployment comedy labored and witless, but it bears the unmistakable scars of a protracted and ultimately failed struggle in the editing room."
m/get_gone, A Texas Chain Saw Massacre-wannabe that will quickly live up to its title.
m/get_hard," Finally, a comedy that homophobes, racists and generally stupid people can all enjoy together!"
m/get_in," Terrible French horror movie has bloody violence, nudity."
m/get_low," Although this is worth watching purely for Duvall's superb turn, he doesn't want for support."
m/get_married_if_you_can," The film is as empty as its script, its direction and its protagonist, as well as all the cast in it. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/get_me_roger_stone, Get Me Roger Stone is absolutely informative about the smiling Slenderman lurking in the darkest corners of Republican politics for decades. And...gut-wrenchingly terrifying.
m/get_on_the_bus, Vividly conveys the yearning of some African-American men for solidarity.
m/get_on_up," It's that rare musician's biography with a deep feel for the music. And in Chadwick Boseman, it has a galvanic core, a performance that transcends impersonation and reverberates long after the screen goes dark."
m/get_out, Get Out is about as effective as a mainstream comedy can be without veering into truly revolutionary territory.
m/get_out_your_handkerchiefs," Going Places, which preceded this film by a year, is the Blier film to beat, but Handkerchiefs is one unruly, rioutously funny entry just the same. (The Academy, is must be noted, preferred this one, and the film took home the Best Foreign"
m/get_real," Captivating performances and a well-honed, economical script that understands the power of images makes this potentially mawkish sexuality coming of age film both entertaining and insightful."
m/get_rich_or_die_tryin," Good news for 50 Cent! He doesn't have to worry about finding a date and a tux for the Oscars, because he won't be invited. He's playing himself, HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?!?"
m/get_santa, This blend of tinsel and grit is elevated by the performances.
m/get_shorty," I did enjoy the intermittent good parts and Travolta's performance is a delight, but the rest of the movie is a waste."
m/get_smart," Although its chemistry never gels, Get Smart pulls off a sufficient number of goofy action set pieces to earn its entertainment value."
m/get_the_gringo," Almost invigorating in its disreputability; it's both cheesy and striking, corny and bold, dismissible and yet strangely appealing for its singularity."
m/getaway," Getaway is an awful picture -- gawky, moronic, and dull. Once again, Solomon proves himself to be an abysmal director, and Hawke should probably look into new representation."
m/gett_the_trial_of_viviane_amsalem, What does a gal have to do to obtain a divorce (a gett) from an Orthodox Jewish man? Quite a lot as this fascinating courtroom drama indicates.
m/getting_even_with_dad, The dysfunctional family in this film is little more than a shameless plot device to introduce a lame father/son bonding adventure.
m/getting_straight, It's an irritating and shallow film that sends the wrong message on college protests and proves Hollywood has little understanding of the counter-culture movement.
m/ghajini," Aamir Khan, as usual, displays his fierce commitment to the role, whether nimbly performing a besotted song and dance or brutally kicking all manner of *ss on his warpath."
m/ghidorah_the_three_headed_monster," Inventive special effects, a great score by Ifukube and a seemingly sincere conviction that the film-makers are making high art all add up to make this one of the more successful Godzilla movies."
m/ghost_and_the_darkness," The Ghost and the Darkness isn't bad as a matinee distraction, but goodness knows it isn't good, either."
m/ghost_bird, A story about wish fulfillment and judgment being clouded by hope.
m/ghost_dad," Just depressing and incompetently assembled, reaching for a madcap mood of paranormal activity that results in one long headache. I now see why Poitier never directed again and Cosby refused another leading role in a feature film."
m/ghost_dog_the_way_of_the_samurai, Sometimes you score points just for doing something different.
m/ghost_in_the_machine, Another one of those brilliant horror movies about homicidal electricity.
m/ghost_in_the_shell," If you try focusing on the plot particulars, Ghost is frustrating and, despite the gunfire, not entirely dramatic. But as a piece of dark art, it's substantial and successful."
m/ghost_in_the_shell_2017," For Johansson, this could easily be a franchise in the making, her own futuristic, post-human equivalent of a John Wick or Bourne."
m/ghost_in_the_shell_2_innocence, Highly imaginative design by Oshii and production designer Tanada Yohei dominates the film as they creates surreal landscapes in dark though vivid colors.
m/ghost_killers_vs_bloody_mary," There is an audience for Ghost Killers Vs. Bloody Mary, it is zany, wacky, and for the most part harmless, though there are moments that are just a little too crass and crude for most."
m/ghost_light_2018," In equal measure a love letter to The Bard, a satirical skewering of theatrical tropes and a cracking Twilight Zone episode."
m/ghost_of_frankenstein, There are various nice touches that keep this film from straying too far over the line between campy and ridiculous.
m/ghost_rider," When Ghost Rider ended, infectious widespread laughter and comments of ridicule broke out in the theater. That is probably not the reaction director Mark Steven Johnson was aiming for, but it was well-warranted."
m/ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance," Ghost Rider ... cannot claim to say much about human nature, but who could not love this actor?"
m/ghost_ship, Exposition litters Ghost Ship like barnacles on a rusty hull. At times the film sits dead in the water while characters stand around updating each other on events we've already seen.
m/ghost_stories_2018," Nyman and Dyson have created a weird world of menace, despair and decay."
m/ghost_team_2016," The hell of it is, Ghost Team nearly redeems itself with a third-act twist that arrives well after the viewer has stopped caring."
m/ghost_world, An irreverently humorous and original portrait of teenage girlhood and the strange world that the lead characters mockingly observe.
m/ghostbusters," As entertaining today as it ever was, a classic to be treasured by all."
m/ghostbusters_2, Almost as sharp as the first film and only suffering slightly from the inevitable repetitions.
m/ghostbusters_2016," Paul Feig's remake is hilarious, forward-looking, and delightfully in touch with its origins."
m/ghostlight, It's a good-hearted dream of a film made all the more fascinating by virtue of its willful weirdness.
m/ghosts_of_girlfriends_past, McConaughey's self-satisfied and oleaginous performance scrapes away the trace amounts of charm the film has to offer.
m/ghosts_of_mississippi, Rob Reiner's self-congratulatory Ghosts of Mississippi portrays Medgar Evers' slaying from the viewpoint of a white guy and can't even do a capable job of that.
m/ghosts_of_the_abyss, The 59 minutes of Ghosts is worth having to sit through all three hours of Titanic.
m/ghosts_of_war," A mediocre mash-up of genres that leaves no cliche unspoken, no horror trope unturned."
m/ghoul_2015," Ghoul rewards attention for much of its running time with subtle scares and growing unease, before squandering it in a shaky chase through twisted corridors that goes nowhere unexpected."
m/ghoulies_2," Horrendous sequel to a shameless rip-off. Not even ""fun-bad."" Well, maybe a little."
m/gi_jane, Unrealistic execution of an intriguing idea - a woman in the Navy SEALS. Moore is intimidating - and built! Viggo Mortensen gives an excellent early performance.
m/gi_joe_retaliation," With a new director and a brand new set of actors and characters, Retaliation delivers with a better storyline that brings back the essence of what true fans remember of the '80's cartoon and comics."
m/gi_joe_the_rise_of_cobra," 'G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra' is... a summer movie, through and through, pure pulp preposterousness, one of the most successful little-boy adventure movies in a long time."
m/gianni_e_le_donne," Wittily observed, humorously understood and keenly felt."
m/giant, Offers a lively portrait of a marriage that weathers all storms and evolves over time into something more than it was at the outset.
m/giant_little_ones," The film belongs to Wiggins, who brings an openness and sincerity to Franky's struggles that help suggest to what extent his character's specific story has elements that everybody will be able to relate to."
m/gidget," It's interesting in how very dated it has become, but all of that interest is extra-textual."
m/gifted_2017, The film's increasingly manipulative treatment of provocative subject matter cheapens the drama of its premise. Webb hasn't allowed much nuance to enter into the equation.
m/gigante, A laid-back drama that gives us a close encounter with a lonely man whose desire animates his life in a new and adventurous direction.
m/gigi," Gigi is all style, and zilch in the way of substance."
m/gigli," A character-driven piece, pitched awkwardly between comedy and drama."
m/gilda, This is fascinating stuff that's played out capably - and sometimes with humour - by a strong cast. Hayworth stands head and shoulders above the rest.
m/gilles_wife," This is Devos' show: She has a face as expressive as any melodrama queen from Hollywood's golden age, and for anyone who's yet to experience the power of this singular performer, this is an excellent place to start."
m/gimme_danger, Stooges fans will find plenty to enthuse about in the film's ample coverage of a little-documented career.
m/gimme_shelter, This look at the Rolling Stones' disastrous concert at Altamont is so chilling it will prevent anyone from ever looking back at the 1960s with rose-colored glasses.
m/gimme_shelter_2014," It's the sort of movie that would have starred Valerie Bertinelli or Kristy McNichol back in the 1980s, tricked out with PG-13 grittiness and religious wholesomeness."
m/gimme_the_loot_2012," I see so many independent movies that sometimes, when an indie movie comes along that really is independent -- that is to say, when it offers up a fresh new way of seeing -- I blink twice."
m/ginger_and_rosa, Potter proves as good on the wonky logic of parents as she does on the self-righteousness of youth.
m/ginger_snaps, Great scary fun boasting nightmarish images that linger long after the lights come up.
m/girl," How to stand out and blend in at the same time? Few films convey that tension better than ""Girl,"" a deeply humane first feature from Belgian director Lukas Dhont about a transgender teen who wants to be a ballerina."
m/girl_cut_in_two," As is nearly always the case with Chabrol, a special pleasure pervades the picture."
m/girl_flu," Despite the continued existence of taboos on the topic, the story of a girl getting her first period is a story worth telling. And Girl Flu does it with charm, humor and loveable weirdness."
m/girl_from_monaco," In these roles, Fabrice Luchini and Roschdy Zem make an accomplished acting team."
m/girl_in_progress_2012," ... when Girl in Progress works, it's a thoughtful trip -- no matter how broad some of its missteps are..."
m/girl_interrupted," You have the main difference between book and movie: One remains pointed and specific, the other broad and generalized."
m/girl_model," This documentary takes a remarkably frank look at the fashion business, using the unusual perspective of a young Russian seeking work in Japan."
m/girl_most_likely_2013," Less funny than her worst SNL sketch, Girl Most Likely strands Kristen Wiig in a dreadful, disingenuous city-vs.-suburbs comedy ..."
m/girl_on_a_bicycle_2013, What wants to be a screwball comedy is run over by preposterous character motivation and a clunky plot.
m/girl_on_the_third_floor," Still, the film's bifurcated structure is cumulatively effective, especially given that it re-centers the narrative on a wronged woman, rather than her thoughtless, rage-filled man."
m/girl_rising," The approach may have a distracting, overly fancy, diluting quality to it, but attention must nevertheless be paid to this film's basic theme."
m/girl_who_played_with_fire," As with this year's ""Red Riding Trilogy,"" the ""Millennium"" triad proves a problematic format for sustaining thematic energy and emotional truth."
m/girl_with_a_pearl_earring," As muted and still as a Vermeer painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring has atmosphere to burn and a near-total action vacuum."
m/girl_with_the_red_riding_hood," Hardwicke's ""Red Riding Hood"" proves the ""Twilight"" formula isn't always a surefire bet. While it wasn't a comedy (and should have been), its only redeeming quality is it's funny to mock."
m/girlfight," Despite the promise of Kusama's debut and the voguish nature of its politics, Girlfight ultimately plays like a hedged bet, rather than the knockout punch it has been taken to be."
m/girlfriend_2011," Shooting in his hometown of Wayland, Massachusetts, Lerner has a keen sense of class and setting. And despite some narrative miscues, Sneider's performance keeps him honest."
m/girlfriend_experience," The effect is impressionistic and provocative, with the emphasis falling differently on scenes because of our knowledge or lack thereof. It also serves to view the ""girlfriend experience"" as a kind of performance art."
m/girlfriends_day," Film noir parody has violence, cursing, and sexual content."
m/girlhood," Oscar-nominated documentarian Liz Garbus relates a familiar tale with a shocking, powerful intimacy that's a desperate cry to be heard from the too many throwaway children of our society."
m/girlhood_2015," Opening explosively with a night-time all-female game of American football set to the hypnotically urgent electro-goth of Light Asylum's 'Dark Allies', Girlhood daringly stakes out new territory for French director Cline Sciamma."
m/girls_against_boys, This Chick pic's greatest provocation is how slow and disengaged it feels.
m/girls_cant_swim, A sensitive and astute first feature by Anne-Sophie Birot.
m/girls_just_want_to_have_fun," Metter's ""Girls"" may just want to have fun but for the rest of us this concept is just wishful thinking."
m/girls_of_the_sun," Girls of the Sun is partisan and it wears its heart on its sleeve: a powerful, forceful story."
m/girls_trip," Unlike some similar comedies about grownup friends, the four core characters are actually likeable."
m/girls_will_be_girls," While cries of misogyny are unwarranted (it's clear that no actual women were harmed in filming), cries of 'ewwwww!' are not."
m/girls_with_balls, A fun take on female empowerment and resourcefulness amongst the lashings of gloopy splatter.
m/girly-1969," This forgotten oddity is ripe for rediscovery -- like its characters, it may get to you even if you don't realize it."
m/giuliani_time, Keating strips away the self-aggrandizement and analyzes the record.
m/give_me_liberty_2019," This warm, fiercely independent comedy-drama eschews anything resembling formula in favor of a boisterous and freewheeling joyride drawn from Mikhanovsky's own experience as the driver of a wheelchair-accessible transport vehicle."
m/give_me_your_hand," What's refreshing about Pascal-Alex Vincent's dramatically thin but richly atmospheric feature debut is that it recognizes the essential truth of the conceit: all seminal voyages are journeys of heightened awareness, as visceral as they are emotional."
m/give_up_tomorrow," Mr. Collins's treatment, though jam packed, leaves one itching to understand more about the bigger picture and the political and social connections involved."
m/gladiator," Gladiator isn't groundbreaking, but it's good old-fashioned entertainment."
m/glass_2019," Put into comic-book terms, Glass takes too long to get from one panel to the next."
m/glass_a_portrait_of_philip_in_twelve_parts," Despite efforts to show the composer's domestic life, including his Buddhist-influenced daily exercise routines, there's no thoughtful discussion of what's behind the serialist music style Glass has brought to worldwide attention."
m/glass_chin," The true measure of a good tale is in the telling, and writer-director Noah Buschel spins his yarn in an unexpected, ultimately satisfying fashion."
m/glass_house, So laughably awful that it begs to have stones thrown at it; it's a wonder it got made at all.
m/glassland, A small but pretty impressive indie from Ireland with top-notch acting.
m/gleason_2016, The director of Finders Keepers proves again that he's brilliant at balancing the devastating and the hilarious.
m/glee_the_3d_concert_movie," Whether you're a seasoned Gleek or new to the pop-culture phenomenon that began as a TV musical series, you'll be tapping your feet and humming along in this upbeat, energetic 3D concert movie"
m/glen_campbell_ill_be_me," Valedictory and elegiac, Keach's film captures a performer who only truly seems to inhabit himself during the performances."
m/glen_or_glenda," In every technical aspect, it's just bad. However, only Ed Wood could pull off being so bad that it's good -- good in a funny, screwed up way."
m/glengarry_glen_ross, Foley is as adept at managing this intensely psychodramatic material as he is handling an ensemble cast with the combined power of a runaway locomotive.
m/glenn_miller_story, Miller's great music is THE thing in this romanticized bio of the band leader.
m/glimmer_man, A truly disgraceful outing that amounts to little more than an unbelievable Steven Seagal self-love fest.
m/glitter, A bad excuse to listen to a few Mariah Carey songs.
m/gloria_2012," With its compelling and original approach to its romance narrative, coupled with Paulina Garca's nuanced and intuitive performance, the film delicately balances an entire octave of emotions."
m/gloria_2015," Gloria has a secret weapon called Sofa Espinoza. Not only does she sing all the songs made famous by Trevi, she became Gloria herself. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/gloria_bell," Gloria Bell pairs perhaps the best portrayer of troubled or lost women with a director who has built a career building stories around them, and the result is a film that comfortably banishes any fears of some neutered US remake."
m/glorious_39," A political yarn - sometimes creepy, sometimes daft - in the Hitchcockian vein."
m/gmo_omg," A documentary that is by turns exasperating, illuminating, and intentionally infuriating."
m/gnomeo_and_juliet, ...possibly the worst animated feature ever to be distributed under the Disney banner.
m/go_back_to_china," Emily Ting has a wonderful eye as a director, yet her screenplay tends to waddle a bit too often into the exposition valley, salvaged primarily by Anna Akana's infectious performance."
m/go_for_sisters_2013, A dangerous border town as no country for old men or middle-aged sisters either.
m/go_further, A message film that makes entertaining diversions out of environmental didacticism.
m/go_tigers," Carlson doesn't let his camera flinch, and his film is more captivating and authentic for it."
m/goal_2_living_the_dream, Intriguing to watch and well-played by the engaging cast.
m/goat_2016, 'Goat''s bracing (yet never preachy) indictments of toxic masculinity are its best quality.
m/goats, A debut feature lacking both finesse and ingenuity.
m/god_bless_america_2011," Sometimes you get the feeling Goldthwait is just making a list of the people he could do without, which is funny and makes you nod your head but doesn't add up to much."
m/god_bless_ozzy_osbourne, [A] rather affectionate and candid portrait of a singer/TV personality whose continuing respiration is regarded as a marvel of human achievement.
m/god_bless_the_broken_road, A good cast can't turn this grieving faith-based drama from Nutrasweet to bittersweet.
m/god_grew_tired_of_us," It's a portrait of both suffering and success, and one that the directors refuse to gussy up in overly sentimental or derisive ways."
m/god_help_the_girl," A major gaffe, God Help The Girl finds a great artist taking on a huge challenge and stumbling painfully on its ambition almost every step of the way."
m/god_knows_where_i_am, It would have been easy for the film to approach its advocacy role through sensationalism. But the film comes from an altogether more inspired and intimate perspective.
m/god_loves_uganda_2013," Kudos to the filmmakers for so adeptly laying out the history of American evangelicals' Ugandan mission, and for noting that HIV infection rates there have gone up since the abstinence-only education started."
m/god_of_war, A character-driven battle epic that plays more like a brightly rendered action-adventure than a starchy history lesson.
m/god_said_ha," Were Julia Sweeney not such a gifted comedienne, listening to her uncompromising account of her brother Michael's struggle with lymphatic cancer would be unbearable."
m/god_told_me_to," There's an underlying satire that isn't only comedy- it's brutal, seething, horrific blasphemy. And it's intoxicating."
m/godfather," While there have been changes from the novel, the film is both compelling and powerful."
m/godfather_part_ii," Even if the 1972 film The Godfather had not been made, its sequel would still be a monumental achievement."
m/godfather_part_iii," Though certainly one of 1990's better films, it is seriously flawed and doesn't hold a candle to the two earlier Godfather movies, considered in most critical corners to be among the best, if not the best, films of the 1970s."
m/gods_and_generals," A movie experience that lasts more than four hours. I wouldn't even want to make out with Jennifer Garner for more than, like, three hours."
m/gods_and_monsters," An example of a reasonably challenging film that doesn't really accomplish what it sets out to do, but is nevertheless thoughtfully-conceived and contains a couple of highly enjoyable performances that keep it afloat."
m/gods_horses, This is less a film about terrorists than an intimate portrait of boys growing up in a toxic environment.
m/gods_must_be_crazy_2," Uys's style sheds a sweet and gentle light on this new comedy, which is a sequel to the surprising international success -- and, I think, a better film."
m/gods_not_dead," Teen-friendly, faith-based movie is heavy on dogma."
m/gods_not_dead_2," The agenda here is front and center from start to finish, and while the actors do a yeoman's job in presenting their characters with aplomb, the entire film simply comes off as a two-hour, jazzed-up movie version of a sermon."
m/gods_not_dead_a_light_in_darkness, These movies are fundamentalist propaganda aimed at people who are convinced their religion is under attack in this country just because it doesn't exempt them from the Constitution.
m/gods_of_egypt," Not only does the film indulge in a right royal round of whitewashing, it also gives star Gerard Butler a brownface."
m/gods_own_country_2017," Skipping some of the more predictable narrative obstacles we've come to expect from the coming-out drama, this sexy, thoughtful, hopeful film instead advances a pro-immigration subtext that couldn't be more timely ..."
m/gods_pocket," An unwieldy dark comedy, the feature directorial debut of ""Mad Men"" star John Slattery is ultimately too shaggy and tonally inconsistent to hold together."
m/godsend, We're just seeing the umpteenth recycled shocker about a mystical dark child with an aura of disaster.
m/godspeed-2009," Saitzyk's sappy pontifications on loss, redemption, and zealotry don't register as headily as they're meant to, and the spirituality invoked feels about as sincere as the Christian who only attends Christmas mass."
m/godspell," It's a series of stories and songs, like the Bible is, and it's told with the directness that simple stories need: with no tricks, no intellectual gadgets, and a lot of openness."
m/godzilla, Godzilla represents the final step of post-war Japan to saddle us with a byproduct of American nuclear waste.
m/godzilla-mothra-and-king-ghidorah-giant-monsters-allout-attack, Really silly and quite bad. But easily hilarious enough to sit through.
m/godzilla-tokyo-sos2003," This modern series is one that's improving with each entry, and all of them are big ol' heaps of rubber suit glee."
m/godzilla-vs-mechagodzilla-ii," With so little connective tissue of note, the monster scenes feel airless and aimless, existing solely as generic spectacle without context or weight."
m/godzilla-vs-megalon," All business when it comes to delivering big action and colorful antagonists, working in a few environmental messages on the dangers of nuclear testing along the way, to anchor the nonsense to come."
m/godzilla_1956," For today's moviegoing audiences, this may not be your daddy's Godzilla movie, but chances are your granddaddy could teach you a thing or two about the context."
m/godzilla_2000," Though it lacks the antic verve of its mid-'60s predecessors, Godzilla 2000 offers some interesting twists for connoisseurs."
m/godzilla_2014," Manages to deliver all the big crowd-pleasing moments we want from our blockbuster devastation epics and leave us wanting more, in the best possible way."
m/godzilla_and_mothra_the_battle_for_earth, Maybe they both could lose? Don't wish for too much.
m/godzilla_king_of_the_monsters," It's hard not to chuckle at the fiftieth cutaway to an oddly passive Burr after watching a scene from the Honda original, but this cut shouldn't be dismissed either."
m/godzilla_king_of_the_monsters_2019," Godzilla: King of The Monsters serves the pure monster extravaganza promised, whilst failing on the human side. The greatness does make mostly up for the poor."
m/godzilla_resurgence," It's a welcome return for the studio who originated the iconic creature creation, but unfortunately, it never lives up to the drama of the 1954 original, or the bananas fun of all the B-Movie schlock that followed."
m/godzilla_vs_destoroyah_1995, [It] may be the most action packed film in the whole series. It begins with the king ripping through Hong Kong and does not stop for a breath until the credits roll.
m/godzilla_vs_mechagodzilla," So yeah, Mechagodzilla. Love it. Love it, love it, love it. Mechagodzilla is awesome. Godzilla is awesome. They fight, and it's awesome."
m/godzilla_vs_megaguirus," In Godzilla vs. Megaguirus, not only don't we know where we are, we also don't know how seriously we're supposed to take the movie."
m/godzilla_vs_space_godzilla," While there is an overall lack of excitement... the film nonetheless delivers on anonymous citizens fleeing in terror, roaring beasts blasting and beating the hell out of each other, and iconic landmarks and urban infrastructure being utterly devastated."
m/godzillas_revenge, It is for desperate fans only and is pretty bad even by the loose standards of the genre.
m/goethe, Philipp Stlzl's film takes both Goethe's genius and the inevitable superiority of the brand of romanticism that marked his early work as a given.
m/going_clear_scientology_and_the_prison_of_belief_2015, Alex Gibney shakes the Scientology tree in his crackling film version of Lawrence Wright's nonfiction bestseller.
m/going_in_style_2017," I'm hoping that Freeman, Caine and Arkin all have plenty of movies - and meatier roles - in their futures. In the meantime, it's a low-key pleasure to hang out with these guys, even in a movie that's only just good enough."
m/going_my_way," Overly corny, this feel-good musical is delightful in its naivety, even for the time."
m/going_shopping, Comes as close as any film to explaining what the deal is with women and shopping.
m/gold_2017," Directed without distinction by Stephen Gaghan, the film unfolds like a chintzy ripoff of David O. Russell ripping off Martin Scorsese ripping off real life."
m/gold_diggers_of_1933, A fabulously fast-paced cynical comedy in which the straight parts of the movie are -- for a change -- nearly the equal in quality to the musical numbers.
m/gold_diggers_of_1935," If Gold Diggers of 1935 wasn't quite up to its predecessor, it's probably the fault of the newly enforced Production Code."
m/gold_star," As an examination of the ways in which we experience grief for the still-living, Gold Star is a remarkably insightful experience."
m/golden_age," All in all, it's a grand package of hearty acting, design and action with the only caveat being that unlike the first film this Elizabeth can no longer surprise us with its modern twists."
m/golden_bowl," As compensation for possible bottom-numbing -in-seat towards the end, Ivory once again delivers a well-performed -- most notably by Nolte and Thurman -- and exquisite-looking tale of manners, love and betrayal."
m/golden_boy_2018," Judas Priest, what century was this dated, dotty melodramatic gay mess made?"
m/golden_child, This film -- insignificant and lightweight and monumentally silly -- is entertaining from beginning to end.
m/golden_door," An imaginative, intelligent and attractive Italo pic precisely when the country needs it most."
m/golden_exits," These thoughtful people are paralyzed by their ability to look at their lives, and the lives around them, from too many angles. It's enlightening to listen to them, and perhaps a little too familiar."
m/golden_kingdom," Golden Kingdom, a narrative feature that seems at first to be a documentary, takes us someplace we might want to visit and convinces us it's utterly different from anywhere else."
m/golden_voyage_of_sinbad," [Its] main raison d'etre is some first-rate ""Dynamation"" special effects from Ray Harryhausen."
m/goldeneye," There is just too much that is too silly about Goldeneye and too many mistakes in the making. It is not as actively stupid as some Bond films have been, but it is well below average in intelligence for the already not too cerebral series."
m/goldfinger," If spy-action films ever had a classic, then this is it."
m/goldie," De Jong forces us to face how few real opportunities are given to girls like Goldie, and to understand why someone would be willing to risk it all even to snatch a mere wisp of a dream."
m/golem," Of the four extant versions of this perennial horror classic, Paul Wegener's 1920 version remains the best."
m/golmaal_3," Ratna Pathak brings a touch of sanity to the mad, mad, show... But, for those who seek something beyond slapstick, Rohit Shetty's work will be disappointing."
m/gomorrah," The remorseless, glamourless scenes - their businesslike realism, their shrugging fatalism, their workaday brutality - come closer than most films to identifying and depicting the ""banality of evil""."
m/gone_2012," While Gone has some visual style, the cheap and melodramatic script fails to make it to the party."
m/gone_baby_gone," By capturing a sense of society lost, by using both the media focus and the behind closed doors denouements that seem to follow such situations, Affleck produces tragedy on an epic Greek scale and moviemaking of classic neo-noir artistry."
m/gone_fishin," After this and 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag, maybe the Academy will ask Pesci to return his Oscar."
m/gone_girl, It'll have you wondering why Fincher went even further down the Barnes & Noble rabbit hole than he did in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
m/gone_with_the_wind," Even though the habits of movie- goers have changed over the years, it's easy to see why this film provoked such an outpouring of praise and adulation during its initial release, and why its stature has grown with the passage of decades."
m/gonjiam_haunted_asylum," Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum is the real deal. Deeply unsettling and unrelentingly scary, it is a film that must be seen."
m/gonzo-the-life-and-work-of-dr-hunter-s-thompson, ...A film that preserves Thompson's words verbatim but only occasionally taps into the restless spirit that fueled them.
m/good_boys_2019," Despite some endearing passages, Gene Stupnitsky's uninspired crude tween comedy Good Boys is a cringe-inducing affair."
m/good_burger," Okay, so Good Burger, based on the recurring Nickelodeon sketch All That, is a pretty awful movie... [Yet] the film's exaggerated cartoon take on teen life has undeniable charm and, oddly enough, perceptiveness."
m/good_bye_lenin," An intriguing concept, hampered only by the curse of all farce: after taking us to the brink of absurdity, it's difficult to reel us back in for the emotionally fraught conclusion."
m/good_dick," A short and sweet anti-romantic comedy, Good Dick puts together a heav ily depressed young woman with a homeless clerk who rents her porn at a Los Angeles video store."
m/good_earth, more of a time capsule than a great piece of filmmaking
m/good_for_nothing," The film's antipodean locales provide plenty of uncharted territory, vast expanses of untamed land that offer endless opportunity but little guidance. A man could get lost out there, and Wallis does."
m/good_fortune_2017," Upbeat story of a self-made millionaire who considers ""sharing"" his cash with worthy charities his life's work -- it only lacks a single skeptical second-guessing/fact-checking source or critic."
m/good_german," It's a close call about which is worse, the acting of Blanchett and Clooney, the directing of Soderbergh, the writing of Attanasio, or the cinematography of Andrews."
m/good_guy," Handsome, well-done if too familiar look at the romantic and professional games played by upscale twentysomething Manhattan professionals working pre-recession."
m/good_hair," A funny, head-scratching doc with a few loose ends."
m/good_kids_2016," It's not a great first feature for McCoy, but it's surely a competent one that speaks loudly -- and somewhat profanely -- to a budding talent with intriguing possibilities."
m/good_kill, Andrew Niccol takes on the topical issue of drone strikes in a tense war drama notable for its tact and intelligence.
m/good_luck_chuck," a lot of dirty-minded snickers, but not as many genuine laughs as you might have hoped for."
m/good_morning, Ozu's most charming foray into comedy since his silent days.
m/good_morning_vietnam," Robin Williams's best ever film. Comedy, Action....a little bit of everything, for everyone."
m/good_mother," Even shackled to banalities, Keaton has the power to amaze."
m/good_neighbor_sam," Like so much current comedy, it is underwritten; it is underdirected; it is underacted. Resurrect the Thin Man."
m/good_neighbors_2011," There's clear evidence that Tierney is maturing as a filmmaker, but he's not there yet, despite having the talents of Baruchel and Hampshire on his side."
m/good_night, Promising debut from writer-director Jake Paltrow about a sleep-obsessed man who meets the literal girl-of-his-dreams has some perceptive moments amid a lot of tossing and turning.
m/good_ol_freda," White's film is a love letter not just to Kelly and the Beatles, but also to postwar working-class Liverpool."
m/good_people_2014, It only overcomes its deficiencies and gains a modicum of entertainment value precisely when it commits to its illogical storylines and exaggerated plot twists.
m/good_sam_2019," Just like the world could always use a few more kind-hearted people looking to make a difference, we can definitely use more movies like Good Sam."
m/good_shepherd," Even if the movie's vast reach exceeds its grasp, it's a spellbinding history lesson."
m/good_son," The movie is a creepy, unpleasant experience, made all the worse because it stars children too young to understand the horrible things we see them doing."
m/good_time, Pattinson makes you root for his character from the start.
m/good_will_hunting, This is a film with a serious credibility problem and one which stagnates in the middle act.
m/good_woman," Oscar Wilde's social satire steps out of the parlor with mixed, if extremely witty, results."
m/good_year, You sense in every frame the strain to be lighthearted.
m/goodbye_christopher_robin," In the end, son-father bitterness is unrealistically (and inaccurately) overcome, and you're left wishing for something more rigourous and less twee."
m/goodbye_columbus, This well-observed comedy knows the American Jewish bourgeois scene well.
m/goodbye_lover, A poorly-paced bland crime drama that has all the twists and turns of a 'Bewitched' episode.
m/goodbye_solo," Solo confronts a less-than-jolly existence with a perpetual smile and helping hand, his upbeat, selfless attitude a means of repelling the harsh realities that threaten to break his spirit."
m/goodbye_to_all_that," If Junebug focused on quieter moments of extended family dynamics, with its city-meets-country clashes delving into resonant, region-specific sensibilities, Angus MacLachlan never goes beyond signpost sentiment."
m/goodbye_world," Goodybe World was even able to surprise me. I really didn't know where it was going, and that's a nice feeling to have when I've seen so many movies, especially in a genre movie."
m/goodnight_mommy," A hefty part of the suspense stems from the fact no one seems to be behaving rationally: not mommy, not the kids."
m/goods_the_don_ready_story," As film starts taking itself more and more seriously, it becomes less fun and more formulaic and tiresome."
m/goofy_movie," If you're going to make something called ""A Goofy Movie,"" why dampen the goofiness?"
m/google_me, Killeen puts a face on a concept that has likely occurred to most of us
m/gook," Gook rises above message-movie mediocrity, enjoying its characters too much to use them as political mouthpieces."
m/goon, Hilariously foul. Best hockey comedy since SLAP SHOT.
m/goon_last_of_the_enforcers," Baruchel's sequel is everything Dowse's original film was, amped up a degree or three ..."
m/goonies," Despite its moments of blandness, the movie works and is a good lab where young Hollywood stars emerge. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/goosebumps_2015, You can know nothing about Goosebumps and enjoy the Goosebumps movie.
m/goosebumps_2_haunted_halloween," The cinematic equivalent of an Ikea dresser put together in a rush. It's slightly askew, and there's a gap between drawers, but it'll still hold your T-shirts."
m/gordy," [The] screenplay is as bland as an afternoon in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, though the director, Australian animal-mockumentary-maker Mark Lewis, adds a touch of menace by using extreme close-ups, bizarre angles and other stylish camera work."
m/gore_vidal_the_united_states_of_amnesia_2013, 'United States of Amnesia' comes not to bury Vidal but to praise him right to the rafters
m/gored," Fighting bulls. It's a tough job, but does someone *really* have to do it??"
m/gori_tere_pyaar_mein," Instead of one satisfyingly complex film, it's two or three films in one, a turducken of comedies."
m/gorillas_in_the_mist, Sigourney Weaver gives an inspired performance as a woman who launches a crusade to save gorillas in Africa.
m/gorky_park, Hopelessly dated and morose -- and much is lost from the bestselling novel.
m/gosford_park, Altman's best film since The Player and one of the best in his long career.
m/gospel, Nothing more or less than a secular retelling of the Biblical parable of the prodigal son.
m/gospel_according_to_st_matthew," seen with 2003 eyes, Pasolini's work presents only the letter of the gospel and leaves out its spiritual essence"
m/gossip," Has many intriguing elements that might have equaled up to more in a tighter screenplay, but it ultimately doesn't satisfy once the end credits have begun to roll."
m/gothic, 'Gothic' can be taken neither seriously nor with a saving pinch of salt.
m/gothika, One of the scariest movies out of Hollywood that I have seen in some time.
m/gotti_2018, It's almost laughable to see this iconic star trying so hard on behalf of a movie that is so clearly compromised in its intentions.
m/governess," If Jane Austen or a Bront sister were inclined to revolve their tale of forbidden love and parlor room intrigue around a Jewish heroine, The Governess would undoubtedly resemble the result."
m/goyas_ghosts," Impressively made, watchable costume drama with strong performances from its three leads, despite the unusual casting."
m/grabbers," A polished, watchable genre entertainment that nonetheless lacks the inspired dialogue and situations needed to make a memorable impression."
m/grace_is_gone," The narrative is flawed, but it benefits from its timely subject (impact of Iraq War on home front) and gender reversal, centering on widower whose wife had died in the war."
m/grace_of_my_heart, Pean to creativity and a celebration of one woman's indomitable creativity.
m/grace_unplugged, Predictable prodigal daughter tale with Christian message.
m/graceland_2012," ...a tough, gritty kidnap tome that pits underdog Marlon against ruthless kidnappers, a corrupt politician and equally corrupt cops all working their own agenda."
m/gracie," In real life, Elizabeth Shue was quite the activist, the first person in her New Jersey community to break the gender barrier in soccer: this is her charming(fictionalized)story."
m/graduate, Lovely Katharine Ross couldn't be more appealing as the daughter.
m/graduation, Graduation isn't some daring amalgam of traditional movie categories; it's simply all over the place.
m/graffiti_bridge," Technically, the film is a compendium of stale MTV gimmicks -- dry ice, stylized sets. It's a neo-Expressionist tempest in a teapot."
m/gran_torino," Walt hates everyone. He kicks his dog. He growls and spits. It's Spitting Blood, Old Man Dirty Harry."
m/grand_canyon_adventure_river_at_risk," As entertainment, it can be heart-poundingly exciting. As education, it has some merit. But as a movie, Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk 3D is kind of a mess."
m/grand_hotel," If you're in the mood for a sentimental look back, by all means check in."
m/grand_piano," Small on scale, this terse thriller plays us like a finely tuned, well, you know."
m/grand_prix," Four decades later, John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix remains the best film ever made about professional auto racing."
m/grand_theft_parsons," A rock'n'roll road movie like no other. Wherever he is, Gram should get a kick out of it."
m/grandma_2015," Paul Weitz has created a perfect role for Lily Tomlin, a woman who matches her innate wisdom, charisma and wit."
m/grandmas_boy," If he's schooling punks on Dance Dance Revolution or making out with Shirley Jones, Nick Swardson steals every scene he's in, giving the material a distinctive twist through unexpected line delivery and crack comic timing."
m/grapes_of_wrath," The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is director John Ford's most famous epic drama - the classic adaptation of John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning, widely-read 1939 novel."
m/grassroots_2012, The treatment here is unabashedly on the side of the misfit idealists; it's possible Grassroots would be a better movie with a couple of grains of salt in its recipe. But its spirit feels authentic.
m/grateful_dawg, Ends up feeling dry and incomplete; its two subjects are stripped of all other characteristics and come across as not very interesting.
m/grave_encounters, The pic's creepiness factor is sufficient to rate this a notch above genre average.
m/grave_encounters_2," Grave Encounters 2 delivers a sick, intense, and scary white-knuckled spookshow that reveres the groundwork set up by the original and expands upon it on every level."
m/grave_of_the_fireflies, ... a beautiful lament and a moving tribute to the people we rarely consider when we think about World War 2: those Japanese who suffered for the crimes of their leaders.
m/gravedancers, An exacting ghost story wielding an old school fright mentality...
m/gravity_2013," With nothingness pressing in on all sides, in a place where the grip of someone else's hand is all that keeps you from the void, life really does seem like a miracle."
m/gravy, Cannibal killers invade a Mexican restaurant and torment the staff and patrons in this broad but not particularly funny comedy/horror picture.
m/grays_anatomy," Using every cinematic trick in the book, [director] Soderbergh turns Gray's one-man world into the most surreal mind-expander since Alice fell down the rabbit hole."
m/grease," I didn't know that in the 1950's, high schools were populated by 30 year olds who constantly broke into nails-on-a-blackboard musical numbers."
m/grease_2," Its cast stuffed with old-school celebrities like Connie Stevens, Tab Hunter, Sid Ceasar and Eve Arden, its soundtrack cluttered with clunky new songs..."
m/grease_live," What a triumph. After three years of watching NBC do summer stock on national television, Fox swooped in and stole the live musical format right out from underneath them."
m/greasers_palace," As a product of an unusually adventurous time in cinema history, Greaser's Palace has perverse appeal. As a comedy, it's virtually unwatchable."
m/great_day_in_harlem," If you wanted to introduce someone to what jazz is all about, this would be an ideal place to start."
m/great_debaters, I had no idea that college debating was so boring. You will agree with me.
m/great_dictator," It may be Chaplin's greatest work, even if it's not his most personal."
m/great_expectations_1947," David Lean's black-and-white masterpiece may be a whirlwind tour of Dickens' novel, but what a well-performed, economic and atmospheric tour it is."
m/great_expectations_2012, A passable feature-length adaptation that does little to burnish the estimable screen legacy of a Dickens classic.
m/great_gabbo, A laboratory experiment that isolates the Stroheim persona for all it's worth
m/great_muppet_caper," The usual pleasures are all here, but the puppeteers seemed especially intent on giving themselves logistical challenges this time around."
m/great_new_wonderful," Danny Leiner's film offers a collection of quiet, tidy vignettes that occur simultaneously in New York City a year after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001."
m/great_raid, This overlong march will bore all but the most nobly patriotic of auds.
m/great_santini, Fantastic performances by Duvall and O'Keefe highlight this father-son tug-of-war.
m/great_waldo_pepper," It has all the elements of a fantastic, touching movie, except one - a script that engages the audience's interest."
m/great_white_hype," It starts out well, as a wicked satire on professional boxing, and then loses its energy, tires of juggling its characters and ends so abruptly at 91 minutes that it feels like the last reel is missing."
m/great_world_of_sound," Morally ambiguous, subtly crafted, resolutely free of clich and made with almost no money, The Great World of Sound is under-the-radar independent filmmaking in the Jarmusch-Cassavetes mode, both noble and ruthless in spirit."
m/great_ziegfeld," Unless you were in an air conditioned movie house in Topeka, Kansas in 1936, I can't see why anyone would want to sit through all three hours of this."
m/greater, Greater loses its way from the get-go; you can't root for an underdog who is sleepwalking through his own movie.
m/greatest_game_ever_played, A wholesome family film with loads of mainstream appeal.
m/greatest_show_on_earth," One of the worst films to ever win the Best Picture Oscar, Cecil B. DeMille's melodramatic circus adventure starring Jimmy Stewart and Charlton Heston inexplicably won the writing award (the called Motion Picture Story)."
m/greatest_story_ever_told, The most unintentionally hilarious biblical epic ever to grace the silver screen.
m/greed_2020, Coogan's one-note riff gets old quickly and the anti-exploitation message lacks punch.
m/greedy_lying_bastards_2012," A serious, hard-hitting doc that eviscerates the know-nothings who claim that global warming, if it exists at all, has little to do with the activities of big corporations."
m/green_book," ""Green Book"" is ""safe entertainment,"" but it's such a smoothly delivered film that it should be considered a highlight of the Hollywood movie year. It's also one of the funniest movies to come around in a long time."
m/green_dragon," In the telling of a story largely untold, Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar."
m/green_for_danger, An unfairly overlooked delight in the annals of British film history.
m/green_hornet, A great evening's entertainment when you want to switch off and dip your head in some popcorn.
m/green_lantern, A joyless amalgamation of expository dialogue and special effects that aren't especially special.
m/green_lantern_first_flight, A literally colorful action-adventure plot...[but] fails to replicate the success of February's Wonder Woman at making its leading character not just kick-ass but fascinating. [Blu-ray]
m/green_mile," Giving much life to these fairly undimensional characters is a strong cast, with Hanks turning in another empathetic lead performance."
m/green_pastures," Constructed as a series of Sunday School Bible stories linked by spirituals, it has enormous charm in its folklorish fancies... What is offensive is the way in which the depths of plangent suffering that inspired the spirituals are totally ignored."
m/green_room_2016," Characterization and emotional investment, however, are in disappointingly short supply, while crucial tension is permitted to dissipate in an anti-climactic final third."
m/green_slime, Hysterically bad sci-fi with an even worse theme song.
m/green_street_hooligans," Hooligans loses the plot late though -- in the filmic and Brit-speak sense -- revealing Hollywood, not hooligan, roots."
m/greenberg," You have to hang with it, squeezing pleasure and the occasional chuckle out of its bitter beauty where you can. It's not for everyone but it rewards those who are open to it."
m/greener_grass," Simply put, Greener Grass is destined to be a cult classic. It's fun and fucked up in the best way possible."
m/greenfingers, It's sweet! Delightful! Trite! Utterly empty! Mewling! Needing to be sprayed with pesticide!
m/greenlight," At 83 minutes, Greenlight is slower in parts than a thriller/horror should be and should never give you time to think, but it's a taut ride with some crazy fun shots."
m/greenwich_village_music_that_defined_a_generation," The film's pleasures are the same ones offered by a sprawling, lavishly illustrated magazine spread."
m/greetings_from_tim_buckley, The result is at once skillfully observed and a bit so-what.
m/gregory_crewdson_brief_encounters_2012," An engaging portrait of a fascinating artist, it is difficult if not impossible to look away from once it gets going -- much like Crewdson's astonishing photographs."
m/gregorys_girl," Maybe only grown-ups should see this movie. You know, people who have gotten over the pains of unrequited love (hollow laugh)."
m/gremlins, [Contains] moments of delicious black humour and satire.
m/gremlins_2_the_new_batch," Less scary than the original, but much funnier -- though the theatrical version has a scene with Hulk Hogan that's unwisely replaced by one of John Wayne on the video."
m/greta_2019," A stupendously game Isabelle Huppert gives audiences yet another reason to venerate her as she raises arched eyebrows to new heights in this silly, funny, camp pulp thriller co-written by Jordan and Ray Wright."
m/gretchen," As Steve Collins' Gretchen proves, not all Amerindies on the festival circuit are made by guys you'd expect to run into in a John Cassavetes festival."
m/grey_gardens," Grey Gardens became a cult film in the '70s, when mavericks and outsiders were the heroes and heroines and the Beales were valued for their alternative world and their priceless eccentricity."
m/grey_gardens_2009," From that David and Goliath setup, filmed in a straightforward style on a shoestring budget, emerge fascinating character studies that underscore both the best and worst of human nature."
m/greystoke_the_legend_of_tarzan_lord_of_the_apes, It's a different approach and will not satisfy viewers intent on seeing thrilling fights and derring-do.
m/gridiron_gang, What was The Rock thinking? Stop coaching and start doing. Give the man something to hit.
m/grido," If Antonioni's assuredness isn't yet in place, Il Grido remains a key transitional work, with remarkable photography, fluid camerawork, and a typically unforgettable finale ranking among its most notable virtues."
m/griff_the_invisible," When introverted office clerk and night-time superhero Griff meets space cadet Melody, you get a small and delightfully charming romance between two of the quirkiest free spirits you'll ever see."
m/grifters," It seduces you into believing it's merely a cheeky trifle, and then, when you least expect it, lowers the boom."
m/grigris," [Features] a thin, undernourished script, mountains of clichs, pale local colour and indifferent performances."
m/gringo_2018, There's something both admirable and off-putting about the elaborate plotting of Gringo...
m/grisbi," Trazendo Jean Gabin em uma performance inesquecivelmente cnica, a narrativa jamais deixa de ser fascinante ao retratar um sujeito cujo carter ambguo  capaz at mesmo de surpreend-lo."
m/grizzly_man," A brilliant portrait of adventure, activism, obsession and potential madness that ranks among helmer Werner Herzog's strongest work."
m/grocers_son, Eric Guirado's documentary background grants a rare richness of detail and unforced humor to his seductive second feature.
m/groomsmen," As time goes by, the supposedly everyday middleclass lifestyles effortlessly enjoyed by his regular Joes begin to seem suspiciously like the province of the idle rich."
m/groove, Both a perfect introduction to the rave experience for the uninitiated and a celebration of electronica for experienced 'headz.'
m/grosse_pointe_blank," The coy, oh-so-hip tone of the title persists through the whole strained contrivance."
m/groundhog_day," What places it in the pantheon of great Hollywood comedies is that it manages to be wildly humorous without being moronic, romantic without being cloying, and meaningful without being preachy."
m/growing_up_smith," This immigrant clash-of-generations set-up risks falling into clich, and sometimes does, but director Frank Lotito and the screenwriters find enough specificity and comedy in Smith's dilemma to keep the genial, family-friendly story afloat."
m/grown_up_movie_star," Grown Up Movie Star is unruly, tortured, crisis-prone, nervy, melodramatic and just charming enough to make you forgive all of the above. It's like a teenager that way."
m/grown_ups," Sandler's version of The Big Chill, with more fart jokes and less ethically dodgy conclusions."
m/grown_ups_2," Crude, sophomoric sequel doesn't improve on original."
m/grudge_2," Story is incidental, as auds merely anticipate the scares."
m/grudge_match_2014," I'd shave a round or two off Grudge Match, but its heart and its fists are in the right place."
m/grumpier_old_men," Nowhere near as funny as the first film. Just a stale, tired rehash."
m/grumpy_old_men," If you poke through Grumpy's cheap sentimentality, you'll find a worthy picture somewhere."
m/grzeli_nateli_dgeebi," The site of the action, the pummeled landscape of revolution and war, isn't incidental -- it's what their generation has inherited, alongside disorder and dissent."
m/gtfo_get_the_fand_out," The rough edges of Sun-Higginson's Kickstarter-funded feature lend it an ingratiating, unpretentious modesty."
m/guardians_of_the_galaxy," Despite occasional disregard for the laws of physics, much of the imagery displayed onscreen is so realistic and thrill-inducing that sometimes even the plot becomes almost secondary during the more intensely visual sequences."
m/guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_2," From the obligatory Stan Lee cameo to the also-obligatory post-credits sequences, Marvel knows its audience."
m/guarding_tess, Enough cannot be said about Cage and MacLaine's performances and their obvious chemistry together -- and it's fair to say that they more than make up for the film's lapses.
m/gueros," Even if Güeros doesn't entirely work, it feels worthy: a film made independently and without interference whose reverence for the past thankfully doesn't result in too much solemnity or seriousness."
m/guerrilla-the-taking-of-patty-hearst, 'As powerful and effective as Owen Morris' The Fog of War'
m/guess_who, Bernie Mac easily makes up for a miscast Ashton Kutcher in a gem of comic timing.
m/guess_whos_coming_to_dinner," ...rather tame and superficial by today's standards: a gentle, sentimental comedy on the subject of interracial marriage."
m/guest_of_cindy_sherman," A latter-day exemplar of the postmodern exercise wherein tangential characters become protagonists, Guest of Cindy Sherman is a fascinatingly flawed and balloon-headed study of an unlikely encounter with greatness."
m/guest_of_honour," [An] over-plotted soap... continues the mystifying career drift of the once-interesting Canadian auteur, Atom Egoyan."
m/guidance_2014," Though it belongs to the same genre, Guidance is nowhere near so good as Young Adult (or even the Jump Street movies, come to think of it)."
m/guilty_as_sin," The plot is preposterous, the logic is sometimes faulty, but Lumet and his actors don't step wrong in the central thrust of the story."
m/guilty_of_romance," I'm starting to get the impression that Sion Sono is just really good at dressing up nonsense. An indisputably talented filmmaker and gut-churner, he knows how to make the audience putty in his hands. But to what end?"
m/gullivers-travels-2010, The material is too flimsy to hold water for 90-odd minutes.
m/gumball_rally, One of many coast-to-coast car-race films indistinguishable from the others.
m/gumshoe," Gumshoe is a perfect sort of summer film - light as a Panama hat, cool as a frosted daiquiri."
m/gun_hill_road," Though the story follows a familiar trajectory, Gun Hill Road offers a lot of fresh insight into the day-to-day transgender experience."
m/gun_shy," Neither romantic nor dark, neither humorous nor satiric, Gun Shy tries to be Bob Newhart, Goodfellas, Mickey Blue Eyes and Forces of Nature and succeeds at none of the above."
m/gun_shy_2017," Gun Shy is a desperate, embarrassingly unfunny attempt at a slapstick caper, with the script firing blanks at each and every turn."
m/gunfight_at_the_ok_corral, Handsome production based on oft-told Wyatt Earp confrontation...Lancaster and Douglas are outstanding.
m/gunga_din," Like the poem, the movie is sentimental and corny and totally absurd, and we wouldn't want it any other way. This is grand and exhilarating filmmaking that's hard to resist."
m/gunless," Gunless is certainly eager to please. Yet for all of its broad humour and cheeky pleas to patriotism, the laughs in this comedy prove to be scarcer than teeth in Gabby Hayes' head."
m/gunnin_for_that_1_spot," After the gimmicky audience-shot concert film ""Awesome ... ,"" Beastie Boy Adam Yauch proves he can make a comprehensive, state-of-the-art docu of interest to basketball aficionados."
m/guns_akimbo, Guns Akimbo is a double-barrel blast of adrenalized chaos. It ain't perfect but [it's] a rush when it fires on all cylinders.
m/guns_of_navarone," A good old-fashioned Nazi ass-whomping, aided by some great effects and a charming pair of heroes."
m/gut, A cerebral and shocking bit of horror for fans who love brain candy with their grue...
m/guy-and-madeline-on-a-park-bench, One of the most underproduced musicals of this or any other year.
m/guy-x, Jason Biggs (doomed to have some variation of the words 'pie-botherer' in every article ever written about him thanks to the American Pie movies) makes a successful leap from comedy to drama here.
m/guys_and_balls," Guys and Balls is an inventory of such cliches, but at least they're trotted out with a modicum of proficiency."
m/guys_and_dolls, ...may have been more than a bit outdated even when it was first released in 1955.
m/guzaarish_2010, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Guzaarish balances its blubbery sentimentality with some beautifully-realised images to heart-warming and generally likable effect.
m/gwen," McGregor gives horror aficionados a few choice jump scares to keep them happy, but Gwen is all about that certain mood common to most folk horror films: a darkening eclipse of dread as the evils of the collective begin to spill out into the night."
m/gypsy_83," A tiny, vulnerable, rather treacly film at heart, one that would probably float away were it not for Ms. Rue's generous presence."
m/gypsy_caravan_when_the_road_bends, Music is the conduit for repudiating stereotypes and fostering cultural unity in Gypsy Caravan.
m/h2_halloween_2," either a work of jaw-dropping, unhinged genius, or the most moronic horror film since Ernest Scared Stupid"
m/ha_shoter_2014," The slow-building import nicely captures the macho, band-of-brothers bond. But that's the only spark this otherwise chilly and remote film has to offer."
m/habermann," A World War II melodrama with a hook, Habermann does a credible job of personalizing a period of the war largely unknown outside the Czech Republic."
m/habit," It captures a certain gritty New York energy of the period, not unlike the texture of a Larry Cohen production. Fessenden gives a great performance as a man headed for a breakdown."
m/hachi_a_dogs_tale," Switching it up from his more familiar fascinations with hooker romance as in Pretty Woman, American Gigolo and Brooklyn's Finest, Gere gets into a very different kind of infatuation, pursuing puppy love in this man's best friend cuddly canine cinema romp"
m/hackers, What it lacks in substance and plausibility it makes up in inventive imagery and deft shadings of a world of scheming cyberpunks.
m/hacksaw_ridge," A gruesome, pounding war film about the courage of a deeply religious man in near-unbelievable circumstances."
m/hagazussa_a_heathens_curse," Feigelfeld uses amplified sound design and MMMD's intense bowed-bass drones to conjure an otherworldly presence from the starkly beautiful natural settings. This is a sensual, slow-burning tragedy filled wth ominous awe."
m/haiku_tunnel," A cute, charming little film that will delight a demographic that desperately needs more humor in their lives."
m/hail_caesar_2016," Like life, much of what's funny about Hail, Caesar!, the new film from Joel and Ethan Coen, is also what makes it a little sad."
m/hail_mary," [S]een alongside Godard's other films, Hail Mary isn't that shocking. It's a film of great sensitivity and yearning[.]"
m/hail_the_conquering_hero," This riotously funny motion picture, this superlative small-town comedy, is also one of the wisest ever to burst from a big-time studio."
m/hair," Milos Forman's movie version of Hair is every bit as exhilarating and exciting as the original play. What's more, Forman has managed to recreate with amazing accuracy the rebellious mood and irreverent spirit of those confusing times."
m/hair-high, The taste meter on Hair High gets turned off somewhere around the halfway mark.
m/hairbrained," Unfortunately, the movie lacks strong enough players to fill in subtext to Mr. Kent's formulaic setups, and the story flounders once Ms. Posey is out of the picture."
m/hairspray," It's one of the best Broadway-tuner adaptations in recent years -- yes, arguably even better than those Oscar-winning ones. Unpretentious, feel-good pic is low on histrionic diva wailing and MTV-style editing, high on retro movie-musical craftsmanship."
m/hale_county_this_morning_this_evening," [Ross] creates a sparsely beautiful film; his shots of insects at night, or cars waiting for an animal to clear the road, are hypnotic"
m/half-light," More televisual than cinematic, Half Light is too chocolate boxy and clean to be completely convincing, but it's a diverting enough story."
m/half_a_sixpence," In case you wondered why Tommy Steele never became a Hollywood star, look here."
m/half_magic," I admire what Heather Graham was going for with her directorial debut (it's definitely coming at the right time), but there's not a fraction of magic here, let alone half"
m/half_nelson," Sardonic yet moving, Half Nelson deftly outlines the perils of youthful idealism without lapsing into knee-jerk cynicism."
m/half_of_a_yellow_sun," Bandele's keen handling of cast and domestic conflict makes for a nuanced historical epic, but he's less sure on the big stuff ..."
m/half_past_dead," It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie, which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline."
m/hall_pass," Is it redundant to note that this Farrelly Brothers picture is rated R, ""for crude and sexual humor throughout, language, some graphic nudity and drug use""? If anything here, the Bros are sticking to their brand. Maybe it's time they grew up a little bit."
m/halloween_2007, Halloween is brilliant. It's a stroke of slice and dice genius.
m/halloween_2018," Thrilling, atmospheric, and brutally violent, Halloween (2018) delivers exactly what fans want from the series and then some."
m/halloween_4_the_return_of_michael_myers," H4 is very much the cheap knockoff of its prototype, but not half as visceral."
m/halloween_5_the_revenge_of_michael_myers, A prime example of the principle of diminishing reruns.
m/halloween_h20_1998," I imagined Miss Leigh telling her friends, 'They wanted me to do a cameo in the remake of Psycho, but I said, hell, I'd do Halloween: H20 before I'd lower myself to that.'"
m/halloween_ii, Halloween II is good enough to deserve a sequel of its own.
m/halloween_iii_season_of_the_witch," Points for trying something new, but the results are more laughable than terrifying."
m/halloween_resurrection," The film's trailer also looked like crap, so crap is what I was expecting."
m/halloween_the_curse_of_michael_myers," Unfortunately, while director Joe Chapelle and writer Daniel Farrands took advantage of a clearance sale at the Horror Cliche Emporium, they forgot to stop in at Plots R Us."
m/hamburger_hill," Unsparing, graphically violent depiction of Vietnam War."
m/hamlet," The play's the thing and it's uncut here, but it does feel like a production brought to the cameras rather than an organic piece of drama coming alive in front of us."
m/hamlet_2," An erratic, freewheeling satire of Middle American mores."
m/hammer_2019," Hammer is noteworthy for its unique approach to a story of challenging family dynamics, but the movie never lives up to the promise of its premise."
m/hampstead," Keaton's terrific, and it's sweet and airy and so unhurried you really feel like you've had a nice afternoon in the long grasses and cool breezes on the edge of the city. You wouldn't want to live there, though."
m/hancock, There's enough good stuff to justify action fan attendance.
m/handmaids_tale, This film adaptation of Margaret Atwood's bestselling 1986 novel heralds freedom as a cherished ideal.
m/hands_of_stone," Gets the job done, but it's hard to escape the feeling that you're watching a routinely conceived, rather generic boxing flick. It's utterly competent, yet it makes Duran's story seem a little so-what?"
m/handsome_harry," With Handsome Harry, the widely respected independent filmmaker Bette Gordon has hit a bull's eye."
m/hang_em_high, This is the film that brought Clint Eastwood (and his reefer smoking habit) back from Sergio Leoneland to Hollywood
m/hangar_10_2015," Found footage has come to be an excuse for storytellers to completely bypass drama, character development, and plot in an attempt to be 'authentic.'"
m/hangin_with_the_homeboys," The day may come when this movie, like American Graffiti and Diner, will be remembered because so many in its cast went on to become famous."
m/hanging_up," The final scene shows the sisters laughing together, preparing a Thanksgiving feast and playfully throwing flour at each other. I felt like throwing something too, but I didn't have any tomatoes."
m/hangman_2015, Another quality horror film damaged by the increasingly dopey found footage format.
m/hangman_2017," Pacino's ex-partner laughs, ""Shouldn't you be fishing?"" Who says he isn't? Oh sure, Pacino is technically on the set...but he generally isn't any more present here than he'd be on the back of a boat somewhere watching a fishing lure bob up and down."
m/hangmen_also_die, The film manages to pull off the tough double of making an anti-Nazi political statement and being thrilling entertainment as well.
m/hanky_panky," ""Hanky Panky"" is a witless, uneven, occasionally tasteless suspense comedy..."
m/hanna," Wright has got plenty of moves, but they seem applied rather than organic, noticeable in their own right rather than an inevitable part of the overall fabric."
m/hannah-montanamiley-cyrus-best-of-both-worlds-concert-tour," Once the movie (and the ringing in your ears) stop, though, it's obvious why Cyrus has become such a phenomenon. She's pretty and stylish but never a mean girl, energetic and popular but not conceited."
m/hannah_and_her_sisters," Despite Allen's wide-spread neuroses, he does not only a fair take on one woman's issues, but a handful of theirs."
m/hannah_arendt," An emotionally compelling and provocative character study of a brave, intelligent woman. Barbara Sukowa delivers a bravura performance."
m/hannah_gadsby_nanette, I truly hope Hannah Gadsby doesn't quit comedy. The obvious irony of Nanette is that her finale has given her that push into mainstream attention and near-universal critical adoration.
m/hannah_montana_the_movie," You grant a little leeway for a movie aimed at kids, but come on. Plenty of kids' movies are clever and make sense. This one isn't and doesn't."
m/hannah_takes_the_stairs," Joe Swanberg's charming comedy Hannah Takes the Stairs marks the Chicago-based filmmaker's third feature, but his first to land theatrical distribution."
m/hannibal_buress_comedy_camisado, Buress' new Netflix special sees the comic run through his hour-+ set with wily ease.
m/hannibal_rising," This horribly ill-conceived project is fake from start to finish, without a moment recognisable as real, and the story is often so badly told as to be laughable."
m/hansel_and_gretel_get_baked, Hansel & Gretel Get Baked is horror meets stoner comedy in a humorous blend of action and gore that will get a tickle out of even the orneriest of witches.
m/hansel_and_gretel_witch_hunters," Fails to raise much hell, insisting on a flat tone of tedious storytelling when all anyone really wants to see are the titular heroes continuously slaughtering broom-riding she-devils."
m/happiest_millionaire," The Happiest Millionaire is a pleasant, tuneful, tasteful musical that is also over-long and uneven. The overall effect, however, is one of pleasure and the movie is ideal family entertainment."
m/happily_never_after, Quantities of unimaginative CGI do nothing to perk up a barely sketched storyline. I spent the movie scratching my head over which audience the studio is hoping to profit from with this noisy rubbish. YouTubers? Tots with ADD?
m/happiness_of_the_katakuris," Basically a one joke film, it goes on too long and boredom sets in."
m/happy_accidents, Miscast performers do not help a story which is repetitive enough to outlast its 110 minutes' time.
m/happy_anniversary_2018," Schwartz and Wells are likable performers, but their charm can't save Sam and Mollie."
m/happy_as_lazzaro," A slow but bewitching burn that rewards viewers' patience with humor and uncanny grace, sealing Rohrwacher's status...as a truly distinctive European major."
m/happy_campers, Insulting to the intelligence and filled with numbingly awful jokes and little originality.
m/happy_christmas," [Happy Christmas] has the ramshackle, slice-of-life, ragged verisimilitude of mumblecore at its best, but fused with a story with actual momentum and unfailingly excellent performances by smartly cast professionals."
m/happy_death_day," If you're prepared to take your brain off the hook, then I reckon this film ticks a lot of boxes as an enjoyably daft way to spend a couple of hours."
m/happy_death_day_2u," It's unfortunate that Happy Death Day 2U is content on rehashing the same central mystery, as it is better than the original in nearly every other way"
m/happy_endings," I enjoyed HAPPY ENDINGS, despite the fact that it uses several narrative devices I hope never to see in indie movies again for some time."
m/happy_feet," By not being afraid of delivering an experience, its impact and enjoyability are unmeasured amongst current kid films."
m/happy_feet_two," Lovely to look at despite the 3D, and sometimes bordering on the psychedelic, this crack-brained morality tale blends the sublimely weird and the cloyingly awful..."
m/happy_gilmore," As dumb as Caddyshack was, though, it seems like George Bernard Shaw compared to this poor stepchild. Back to stand-up, Adam Sandler."
m/happy_happy, Happy Happy is a winning comedy that gets good-natured fun out of characters behaving quite badly.
m/happy_happy_joy_joy_the_ren_and_stimpy_story," Doesn't delve deep enough into the void and back again to leave a cartoonish hammerhead imprint on the brain or a tear-soaked membrane around our swollen, bleeding hearts."
m/happy_here_and_now," When Amelia takes the full multimedia plunge in the movie's final moments, Happy becomes something inexplicably (and metaphysically) beautiful."
m/happy_people_a_year_in_the_taiga, It would be inaccurate to call Happy People: A Year in the Taiga the newest Werner Herzog film.
m/happy_texas," Northam provides low-key comic counterpoint to Zahn's hilariously manic turn. Macy's deadpan, earnest sheriff is the one to watch, though."
m/happy_valley_2014," Those familiar with the story will find nothing new for large stretches of Happy Valley, and as presented some of the confusions unleashed by the scandal lack the context necessary to extract their significance."
m/happythankyoumoreplease," Tony Hale's winning characterization of an improbably straightlaced suitor who woos the ""quirky"" Annie saves the movie from total disaster."
m/hara_kiri_death_of_a_samurai," It doesn't help that Miike shot Hara-Kiri in 3-D, which as usual accomplishes nothing save for making the action look as if it's taking place during a partial eclipse of the sun."
m/harakiri," even if Kobayashi's first period film is an exemplary tale speaking as much to our own times as to Japan's feudal era, it is also a ripping yarn, keeping the viewer gripped with its jigsaw structure and intense performances."
m/harbinger_down, Ranks somewhere between self-consciously cheesy SyFy Channel fare and better-than-average direct-to-video product.
m/hard_breakers_2010, Remember those teen sex comedies like Losin' It that started the careers of people like Tom Cruise? This isn't one of them.
m/hard_candy," Yeah, this candy is hard to handle, but at the same time it's oh so sweet."
m/hard_core_logo," Like the best ""mockumentaries"", this often feels like the real thing - unlike the obvious parody that was SPINAL TAP."
m/hard_eight," Movies like Hard Eight remind me of what original, compelling characters the movies can sometimes give us."
m/hard_kill," Completely devoid of logic or suspense, the latest cash grab for Willis seems to have exhausted its entire budget on assault rifles and tactical gear."
m/hard_rain," ...while it's no Speed, Hard Rain is a suitably diverting way to spend an hour and a half."
m/hard_sell," This study of an impoverished student and a stripper teaming up to bilk his rich classmates feels like a Risky Business rip-off, which doesn't make it any less lousy."
m/hard_target," Woo, a master of stylized violence and explosive action, has had to buy into America's fascination with explosive effects and reaction. Something gets lost in the transition."
m/hard_to_be_a_god_2015," A slo-mo kaleidoscope of chaos and also a relentless prose poem of fear, featuring three hours' worth of non-sequitur dialogue, where each line is an imagist stab with nothing to do what has just been said."
m/hard_to_kill," One of Steven Seagal's best films, but that's not saying much."
m/hard_way," Fox and Woods let off some good sparks in a vivacious, witty and fast romp"
m/hard_word," I liked the premise and the basic storyline, it's a great mix of action and comedy, but it lacks focus."
m/hardball," By the end ... I fled the theater with ill wishes for everyone involved, including the projectionist and the guy who sold popcorn."
m/hardcore_henry," The most shocking part of the whole film isn't that it's heart-poundingly intense (it is) or that it feels new and inventive (it does that too), but that it's at times pretty damn witty with some terrific story beats (no, really)."
m/harder_they_come," Jimmy Cliff, a noted exponent of the native rocklike Reggae music, is natural and energetic in his movie debut as the ill-starred singer-gunman."
m/hardware, One of those lovingly crafted movies where ingenuity and enthusiasm overcome the budgetary limitations.
m/hari_kondabolu_warn_your_relatives," He mixes a lot of topical and political humor with goofy stand up, observational humor... but then it's funny."
m/harlem_nights," It's narcissistic, misogynistic and extremely mean-spirited."
m/harmonium," While the first hour slyly builds up the illusions of a man and his wife using the stranger as a catalyst for their weaknesses, in the second half their guilt and lies come home to roost with a shock. It's hard not to leave the film shaken."
m/harmontown," ... it has something to say about fandom, and just people, in general, so the uninitiated shouldn't shy away entirely."
m/harold_and_kumar_2," In its own wacky way, Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay is one of the ballsiest comedies to come out of Hollywood in a long time. No kidding."
m/harold_and_kumar_go_to_white_castle," Has the coarse exterior of a typical 'stoner classic,' but also a prominent undercurrent that is sweet, clever, and even a little thoughtful."
m/harold_and_lillian_a_hollywood_love_story," For an hour and a half, this charming little movie, with its chatty talking heads and its sweet-natured subjects, offers a glimpse into the lives of two fascinating people ..."
m/harold_and_maude," The epitome of a film that you can't believe you're laughing at, but you are. A lot. It hurts. In a good way."
m/harolds_going_stiff," There are enough interesting ideas, memorable lines and inventive choices to make this is a notable entry into the overstuffed DIY horror canon."
m/harper," Harper shows the actor to good advantage, Newman's nonchalant demeanor well suiting the character of the PI."
m/harpoon_2019, I haven't gleefully laughed this hard at a dark comedy in a very long time. It's vicious and nasty in the best way.
m/harrisons_flowers, A gripping account of one woman's desperate yet determined search for her photojournalist husband believed by all his colleagues to have died in the Croatian civil war.
m/harry_and_the_hendersons, The movie feels heavy and repetitive. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/harry_benson_shoot_first," It's a breezy, enjoyable portrait of a man for all seasons, a likeable, charismatic, visual raconteur who would do anything -- who has done almost everything -- to get his shot."
m/harry_brown," Caine's mesmerising, tough-as-old-boots performance makes Harry Brown, if no Get Carter 2, somewhere not a million miles removed. Get some."
m/harry_dean_stanton_partly_fiction_2013, An oddly satisfying mix that offers considerable insights into Stanton and his acting career.
m/harry_potter_and_the_chamber_of_secrets," Mostly fun, somewhat enchanting, and at a few turns -- surprisingly spooky."
m/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_1," While it's by no means a bad Harry Potter movie, the overriding feeling is that it's an incomplete one. Here's hoping that Yates and his team put that right next summer."
m/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011," Defined by darker mood and greater gravity than previous chapters, this film concludes the series on a high note that should please viewers and get serious attention as Oscar contender."
m/harry_potter_and_the_goblet_of_fire, Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is an endurance test for its audience.
m/harry_potter_and_the_half_blood_prince," A remarkable achievement... moving, funny, honest and true and sad and sweet. A movie about characters who we have come to know and love, and a movie that understands that it's these characters, and not the magic they perform, that is the real hook."
m/harry_potter_and_the_order_of_the_phoenix," The metaphors are all implicit and have a lot to do with just growing up and facing unpleasant realities, but they increasingly contribute to the feeling of nervousness and unease creeping into the series."
m/harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban," Assured, visually triumphant filmmaking that isn't simply a joy to look at, but also bewitches with its tightly conceived plotting."
m/harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone," The wonderfully imaginative, fabulously eccentric world of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has been brought to the screen with spectacular success."
m/harsh_times," Shot and acted on an adrenaline rush, Harsh Times has the free structure and intensity of a true indie film, but is sometimes just a little off-balance."
m/harts_war," If you've ever heard the word ""schizophrenic"" used to describe a movie and you weren't exactly sure what that meant, the wartime drama Hart's War is a picture-perfect example."
m/harvard_beats_yale_29_29, Ideas were flying around like bullets. And so were the footballs.
m/harvard_man, Gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact Toback himself used it in Black and White. But Toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again.
m/harvest_2011," This is largely a non-narrative piece, the director employing a slice-of-life-in-crisis approach that only works if the characters or the situations are sharply drawn. Neither are."
m/harvey_1950," This is a happy movie and leaves a long, lingering warm glow."
m/harvey_girls," The story and songs are reminders of a gentler, more innocent age that clearly never existed but was fun imagining in the movies."
m/hasan_minhaj_homecoming_king, The centrepiece for Minhaj is a truly astonishing and bittersweet tale about his prom that is alone worth the price of admission.
m/hasodot-emeth, Nesher's skillful hand as director and the convincing performances of the lead actresses allow both halves of the film to peacefully coexist without becoming overly schmaltzy.
m/hatari," All in all, one of those rare films that genuinely constitutes a 'late masterpiece'."
m/hatchet," Like its villain, its brute strength makes up for its relative lack of brains."
m/hatchet-for-the-honeymoon-1969," The general consensus on this Mario Bava film is that it's a departure from the traditional Giallo formula and that it's not one of his best, but it's one of my favorites."
m/hatchet_ii," Writer-director Adam Green offers another super-sized dose of bone-shattering, blood-splattering mayhem."
m/hatchet_iii," BJ McDonnell, too hesitant to stray from the beaten path set by Green's previous films, lacks the looser, more whimsical hand that would have allowed Hatchet III to transcend its thoughtlessly imitative state."
m/hateship_loveship," Like the world's longest advertisement for cleaning products, Hateship Loveship might well have come with the tagline: scrub your way to a better life."
m/hating_breitbart, You have to give Hating Breitbard credit. No other film on the subject would be as slavishly non-objective as this one.
m/haunt_2013," Mac Carter repeatedly compromises his intuitive, and often elegantly framed, glances at his main characters' teenage blues by too busily going through amateur-night gesticulations of spooking his audience."
m/haunt_2019," For folks who love horror, and the killers run amok at a haunted attraction subgenre, this works."
m/haunted_2014," Dark House practically drowns under the weight of mismatched horror tropes, including a preponderance of loud-noise jolt-scares and idiotic character behavior."
m/haunted_mansion," Best of all is Parker, the perfect melancholy romantic hero, brooding and dark, yet touching and sentimental."
m/haunted_palace, Vincent Price is deliciously maddening in a dual role...
m/haunted_world_of_el_superbeasto, It has all the failings of today's least inspired cartoons.
m/haunter_2013," Clever, unexpected, and elevated by an engaging leading lady performance from Abigail Breslin. It's also convoluted as hell."
m/haunters_the_art_of_the_scare, A highly entertaining documentary that contains more heart than you would expect from the subject matter.
m/haunting_of_molly_hartley," The story's a snooze, so the filmmakers punch it up with smash cuts and thunderclaps that turn the most laughably banal items into cheap jack-in-the-box shocks. They'll make you flinch -- but then again, so will most of the dialogue."
m/hausu," It's about equal parts brilliant, baffling, ridiculous, and unwatchable."
m/hav_plenty," Ah, love! Ah, black stereotypes! Why is it so hard to portray the black middle-class and the rich with any dignity?"
m/hava_nagila_the_movie," A playful and fun history of the Hebrew ""Hokey Pokey."""
m/havana_motor_club, The camera looks lovingly at the Fifties American muscle cars while also capturing the enthusiasm and hope in these men's stories.
m/have_a_good_trip_adventures_in_psychedelics," With no real thesis or through-line, the movie winds up being little more than a series of revue-style blackout sketches, lengthy digressions and dead ends."
m/havoc, Director Barbara Kopple strays into territory occupied by James Toback and Catherine Hardwicke.
m/hawking_2013," There's an admirable refusal to canonise the prof, and we're left in no doubt that his life has not been plain sailing either for him or those he relies on ..."
m/haxan," Viewers who think ""silent"" films are boring and primitive would do well to start with this one as an example of how advanced they really were."
m/haywire_2011," Though Haywire is very much the sort of slick, sassy Soderbergh we've come to expect from the prolific director, it's bogged down with a poor sense of story development and some less-than-clever plotting conceits."
m/he_got_game, Spike Lee frames the playground basketball sequences with energy and style.
m/he_knows_youre_alone," ...we never get to know the victims well enough to allow any real suspense to develop about their deaths. If she's young and pretty, expect her to die."
m/he_loves_me_he_loves_me_not, The pointlessness of this exercise is surpassed only by its rank misogyny.
m/he_named_me_malala, An expectedly stirring portrait of the exceedingly smart and courageous Pakistani teenager who defied the Taliban and lived to tell the tale.
m/he_said_she_said," He Said, She Said is not a great movie or even a very good one, but it contains likable performances and enough occasional wit that it feels like a missed opportunity, and not just a wasted effort."
m/he_walked_by_night," This is one of my favorite films noir, made on the cheap at Eagle-Lion Films."
m/he_was_a_quiet_man," He's [Christian Slater] still a capable actor, but seems to be having as much trouble finding good scripts as his Heathers co-star Winona Ryder."
m/head_count," Elle Callahan's Head Count is a steaming bowl of California ""Creepypasta"" served up hot n' fresh for horror fan consumption."
m/head_of_state," A distinct disappointment coming from a comedian whose stand-up work is so sharp, funny and relevant."
m/head_on," A film more easily admired than enjoyed, but there is much to admire in this bold, unsettling film."
m/headhunters," ...one of the most exciting, flat-out captivating thrillers to come around in quite some time."
m/headshot_2010," This Thai crime thriller has some novel ideas and is strikingly shot, but a jumbled, overreaching narrative robs it of cohesion."
m/headshot_2017," Fans of extreme Asian genre action won't care that things eventually grow somewhat predictable and repetitive: In terms of sheer, punchy physical vigor, ""Headshot"" is a knockout."
m/heal_the_living, ...an all-too-uneven piece of work that never quite lives up to the promise of its stellar first act.
m/hear_my_song," It's a slim story, this Irish romantic fantasy about the search for a long-lost singer. But it's held together by an abundance of music and a centrifugal playfulness."
m/hearing_is_believing," The music prodigy in this doc is an inspiration, but this limited, gushy film is not."
m/heart_is_a_lonely_hunter," Alan Arkin, as Singer, is extraordinary, deep and sound."
m/heart_of_a_dog," Anderson keeps the subject matter compelling, sometimes provocative, sometimes indulgent, but never pretentious."
m/heart_of_gold, Another snapshot of his fabled career that's of little interest to anyone outside his many fans.
m/heartbeat_detector," It has haunted me ever since I saw it, with its implied foreboding for the future. Implied and justified in my opinion, and it may become yours if you choose to catch Heartbeat Detector."
m/heartbeeps," ...packs the sensation of shards of stained glass being wedged into your brain; Heartbeeps will, with very little effort, burn itself right into your next 15 nightmares"
m/heartbreak_ridge, Eastwood's clearly having a ball as a gravel-throated solider man.
m/heartburn, No chemistry between Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson
m/heartless-2009," Sturgess gives it his all in a sweaty, breathless, claustrophobic performance, but commitment alone isn(TM)t enough to lift this film all that far above the pack."
m/heartlock," No matter the convincing performances and poignant points regarding politics in the prison community, this deadly dull drama doesn't get away with a get-out-of-jail-free card."
m/hearts_and_minds," A masterful documentary, one of the most unsettling discussions of Vietnam and its aftermath ever to appear in any medium."
m/hearts_beat_loud," A truly sweet, funny, and downright likable comedy."
m/hearts_in_atlantis," a film in the tradition of King adaptations ""Stand By Me"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption."""
m/hearts_of_darkness_a_filmmakers_apocalypse," At once anecdotal and revealing, this excellent film both illuminates the catastrophes that beset one particular project, and shows, by way of comparison, exactly what American film has foregone since the '70s."
m/heartstone_2017," A striking, indelible and profound debut for Gudmundsson."
m/heat_2013," Ultimately Wild Card isn't sharp enough to execute its modest ambitions, leaving one with the impression that a lot of stylishness has been flaunted without much to show for it."
m/heat_and_dust," In retreating from emotional involvement with its characters, Heat and Dust ultimately suffers from the gentility it parodies."
m/heathers," For a long time, we're not even sure of the point of view: Is this a black comedy about murder or just a cynical morality play? The traveler in the foreign country is not sure, but he knows the film inspires thought."
m/heatstroke_2014, An uneven but entertaining look at the animal in all of us.
m/heaven," An entertaining film, but it leaves you unsatisfied."
m/heaven_1999," All there is to the film is the hook; take it away, and what's left is a rather uninvolving tale."
m/heaven_can_wait_1943," Heaven Can Wait may be 73 years old, but it's vibrant and alive, and teaching us anew the central language of film."
m/heaven_help_us," The picture is timid, and all but worthless, but moviegoers who have always longed to see Donald Sutherland as a monk -- and I know that you guys are out there -- will be in ecstasy."
m/heaven_is_for_real, Fumbles for um-when-in-doubt-just-believe answers instead of following through on the hard questions.
m/heaven_knows_mr_allison, Solider and nun on Pacific isle during WWII. More dutiful than fun.
m/heaven_knows_what," Heaven Knows What quickly obtains an oddly charming rhythm, a sense of eavesdropping on sometimes unlikable, but fully realized, social outsiders."
m/heavenly_creatures, A movie that begins with high tension gradually fizzles out.
m/heavens_gate, Watching this movie is like watching three or four films.
m/heavens_prisoners, A humid and sweaty potboiler that fritters away the potential to be hot and steamy.
m/heavy," You've been in places like this. You linger over a second cup of coffee and people-watch, trying to guess the secrets of the sad-eyed waitress and the drunk at the bar and the pizza cook who looks like he's serving a sentence."
m/heavy_metal_in_baghdad," Whether you love or hate metal, Acrassicauda's struggle to stay together -- and alive -- will rock you."
m/heavy_traffic," There's something to offend everyone in this melange of crudely conceived, amateurishly animated stuff."
m/heavy_trip," Heavy Trip solidifies its place among other beloved metal genre films by summoning a dark comedy that even those who aren't familiar with Pantera, Children of Bodom, or Uruguayan grindcore can throw their horns up and enjoy."
m/heavyweights," Time has been kind to the discarded fat camp movie, finding Heavyweights more digestible these days, after years spent processing the askew sense of humor shared by Apatow and Company."
m/hebrew_hammer," The corker-to-groaner ratio heavily favors the latter as the bagel-and-dreidel jokes begin to lose their spark, as does the story."
m/hector_and_the_search_for_happiness, At times the whole thing is a hippie's beard whisker away from a clueless pop star on a charidee PR trip to a developing country.
m/hedwig_and_the_angry_inch," Funny as hell, and Trask's tuneful music makes one want to rush out to get the CD."
m/heidi_fleiss_hollywood_madam," It is so muddled, it is like staring at something through a glass of mud."
m/heights," Marsden delivers his best performance to date, showing that he has more than one facial expression; he has two."
m/heimat_is_a_space_in_time," So, it remains up to the viewer to measure the continuance of the past while the actual family history - who died; who married who - becomes as riveting as a half-grasped soap opera, with lives and loves disappearing in the fog of time."
m/heist_2015," You've seen neo-noirs like this before, but you probably haven't had this much fun with a modern B movie in a while."
m/held_up," Thanks to an attractive cast and an air of amiability, much of it works."
m/helena_from_the_wedding-2010," Marriage is hell. Matrimony is rife with mistrust, misdeeds, and misconceptions. But you know what's worse? Being single. We get it."
m/heleno_2011," [C]uriously all but avoids the game -- except for a few opportunities for Heleno, a hothead with no self-control, to berate and abuse his teammates -- in favor of a lurid focus on his other public exploits."
m/heli, Heli may be the most optimistic film you will ever see in which one young man sets another's genitals on fire.
m/helicopter_mom, A forced comedy that mines uneasy humor from stale stereotypes.
m/hell_and_back," It's a wonder how this stinker of a script -- packed with foul language, sex references, and scatological jokes -- attracted such a strong cast in the first place, and the finished film is no better."
m/hell_and_back_again, You can feel just how jarring and stressful it must be for a soldier to go from the life-and-death adrenaline rush of war to the maddeningly slow world of rehabilitation and forced inactivity.
m/hell_baby_2013," It doesn't reinvent the wheel after their anarchic sketch comedy show ""The State,"" but funny is funny, and Hell Baby is very, very funny."
m/hell_comes_to_frogtown," At any rate, Hell Comes to Frogtown is a decent flick, warts and all."
m/hell_fest, Captures all the fun and excitement of wandering aimlessly through an amusement park with boring people you don't like.
m/hell_house," Preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time, which is a pretty amazing accomplishment."
m/hell_house_llc_iii_lake_of_fire, The bigger the film's structure grows the weaker the foundation becomes until it all comes crashing down.
m/hell_night, Hell Night brought out the gimp at least a decade before Pulp Fiction was even a twinkle in Quentin Tarantino's eye.
m/hell_on_the_border, Gyasi's quiet gravitas and the excellent supporting cast bring an engaging story to life.
m/hell_or_high_water," A gritty, darkly humorous, and fiendishly violent neo-western."
m/hell_up_in_harlem," An implausible and near-uninteresting follow-up to Cohen's superior ""Black Caesar."""
m/hellbenders," It's a shame this story about sinning saints doesn't provide the necessary shock and awe entertainment, because director J.T. Petty is sitting on some serious cult cinema potential - it just never is achieved."
m/hellbound_2012," An engaging, accessible documentary that explores the (truly) eternal questions, ""Does hell exist? If so, who ends up there, and why?"""
m/hellbound_hellraiser_ii, The film collapses into a bloody mess of bravura set pieces that never add up to a satisfying whole.
m/hellboy, Every scene is an orgy of elaborate visual effects but there is so little to tie them together that the reels could be shown in any order...
m/hellboy_2019," Despite a potentially compelling lead, Hellboy is a surprisingly boring superhero epic that drags between sequences of fantasy action spectacle."
m/hellboy_2_the_golden_army," del Toro has succeeded in creating yet another masterpiece of genre storytelling ... A film worthy of following its wonderful original and, in many ways, superseding it."
m/hellion_2012," An engrossing glimpse into a working class nightmare, a lifestyle of indulged biker-kids, guns, violence and beer that is every bit the trap we consider our inner cities to be. to be."
m/hellions," When it comes to the visual scheme of ""Hellions,"" less would have equaled more. There is enough good left to savor, however, to prove more treat than trick."
m/hello_again," All of this is presented with a broad-stroked, sitcom raucousness that's pretty tough to stomach."
m/hello_dolly," Watch Hello, Dolly! in close succession to, say, The Sound of Music, and the latter film's elegant editing and harmonious visual schemes are all the more conspicuous."
m/hello_herman_2012," It barely tries to offer insight into its much-debated subject, content to rip the scab off an ever-fresh wound for the sake of controversy."
m/hello_i_must_be_going_2012," For all its faults, Hello I Must Be Going marks a huge step up from actor-director Todd Louiso's previous efforts..."
m/hello_lonesome_2010," They all run aground on questionable decisions, ranging from minor annoyance to insurmountable obstacle."
m/hello_mary_lou_prom_night_2," Every scene, every exchange and delivery lacks finesse, and actors move through the motions of a choppy screenplay with all the charm of underachievers in an after-school special."
m/hello_my_name_is_doris," ""Hello, My Name is Doris"" effectively conveys the cruel ambivalence of an ageist society, and despite its formulaic ingredients, the movie responds to that setback with Field's exuberant, virtuoso turn providing the ultimate critical response."
m/hellraiser," Lots of sex and violence, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
m/hellraiser-bloodline, What a swell idea! I wish they would put more slasher icons in space...
m/hellraiser_deader," We figure most viewers want their horror films to be, you know, scary. Which Deader is not."
m/hellraiser_iii_hell_on_earth, A step above the standard slasher flick and comes with some unusual ideas (along with some silly ones).
m/helter_skelter_1976, Its possible value is undermined by TV film values and fake Beatle tracks.
m/helvetica," A splendid documentary about one typeface, designed in 1957 in Switzerland."
m/hemingway_and_gellhorn_2012," Kidman is strong here as Martha Gellhorn, using her exceptional figure and old-fashioned movie star glamour to full effect."
m/henri_langlois_the_phantom_of_the_cinematheque, A treat for anyone who's passionate about films or who's ever wanted to learn more about them.
m/henry-portrait-of-a-serial-killer," The fact that Henry is affectless on the surface but commits exploitation-movie mayhem on the side is, by now, less an unsettling revelation than a rote banality."
m/henry_fool," The complexities and weirdness of popular culture provide the backdrop for this black comedy about creativity, politics, publishing, and mentors."
m/henry_poole_is_here," ""Henry Poole is Here"" is not a movie, but rather a sketch for a screenplay that was never written. If ever there was a cinematic impetus to give up all hope for humanity and free expression, it is this patronizing, condescending, and vacuous waste of cell"
m/henry_v_1946, Olivier's terrific performance and William Walton's sweeping score render it one of the best Shakespeare films ever made.
m/henrys_crime_2010," Enjoyable, bittersweet comedy-drama that has a pleasingly old fashioned feel to it, thanks to an intelligent script, well written characters, impressive direction and a delightful performance from Vera Farmiga that's worth the price of admission alone."
m/her," If, like me, you've admired Jonze's ambitions more than you've responded to his results, you may find that Her puts his means and his ends on more equal footing. He shoots for the moon and, this time, hits it."
m/her_alibi," Her Alibi is a trifling confection, a near-invisible farce, cinematic pocket lint. That's not to say that it's a terrible movie; cake icing certainly isn't a terrible food."
m/herb_and_dorothy," Delightful, involving doc about an unlikely couple who became pioneer contemporary art collectors with working-class salaries."
m/herbes_folles, Wild Grass is a casual flexing of careworn but finely tuned creative muscles that playfully demands reverence.
m/herbie_fully_loaded," [It] will amuse kids, but this Bug is low on comic gas."
m/herbie_goes_bananas," A cheerful, four-cylinder children's movie, though its car jokes aren't good for much mileage."
m/herbie_hancock_possibilities, Possibilities will likely draw in only the most hardcore of Hancock's fans.
m/hercules, A Disney fable savvy enough not to let its sincerity get in the way of its zippy multimedia charm.
m/hercules_in_the_haunted_world," The acting (aside from Lee) is wooden and the script extremely choppy, but the film is elevated by Bava's renowned eye for atmospherics."
m/hercules_the_thracian_wars," Once Brett Ratner flips that switch and Dwayne Johnson is unleashed, an entertaining and surprisingly enthusiastic swords and sandals actioner is in full swing."
m/here_2011," The dreamy, feverish beauty of these sequences just barely balances out the pretension of the exposition."
m/here_and_there, Here and There feels exactly like an amateur effort from a first-time director.
m/here_comes_mr_jordan," The delightful Here Comes Mr. Jordan was based on a play (Harry Segall's Heaven Can Wait), but it's hardly a stagebound film, given its ease at hopping between numerous locales both earthy and celestial."
m/here_comes_the_boom," Cage fighting is not inherently funny. In fact, it's the opposite of funny, something like cock fighting only with people, and this presents a problem the movie never completely overcomes."
m/here_comes_the_devil, Better sex scenes than scary scenes. Too few of either to make a difference.
m/here_comes_the_groom, Capra desperately tries to capture his prewar whimsical mood.
m/here_on_earth," Here on Earth does what it can to flatten the ascending careers of its attractive leads, yet Chris Klein and Leelee Sobieski probably will live to see another big-screen day."
m/hereafter," Hereafter occupies some muzzy twilight zone, too woo-woo sentimental to be real, too limp to make for even a halfway decent ghost story."
m/hereditary," It's pure emotional terrorism, gripping you with real horror, the unspeakable kind, and then imbuing the supernatural stuff with those feelings. It didn't play me like a fiddle. It slammed on my insides like a grand piano."
m/hermans_house," A portrait of an invisible man, Herman's House is a raised voice in the constitutional debate over solitary confinement."
m/hermia_and_helena," There's a reason why petits fours are a patisserie staple, and grands fours are not: what's puffily perfect at bite size can turn cloying in a larger slice."
m/hero," Instead of reinventing this genre, Zhang opts to dazzle his audience with his assemblage of technical and aesthetic wonders."
m/hero_and_the_terror," The plot of this movie barely makes sense, and Chuck Norris doesn't even have the decency to kick that many faces in before it wraps up its amazingly tedious 96 minutes."
m/heroin," Heroin(e) is a flashpoint in a national crisis with no end in sight, as another set of sirens preceed the closing credits."
m/herschell_gordon_lewis_the_godfather_of_gore_2011," Crammed with clips, behind-the-scenes footage and other archival material, this documentary love letter to pioneering exploitation filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis is aimed squarely at fans of his boundary-testing gore and nudie movies."
m/hes_just_not_that_into_you," Like a really good date, you'll be crossing fingers this one won't end until the morning."
m/hes_way_more_famous_than_you_2013," This frenetic movie has moments of wit, and Ms. Feiffer, a seasoned screen and Broadway performer, has range, stamina and charisma."
m/hesher," Dangerous, immoral and just plain wrong at parts, and that makes it fantasy. I don't even think it's wish fulfillment. It's just putting bold concepts on screen and asking audiences to deal with them."
m/hester_street, Joan Micklin Silver displays a sure hand for her first pic.
m/hey_arnold_the_movie, The mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick.' Translation: 'We don't need to try very hard.'
m/hey_bartender_2013, Douglas Tirola's documentary is an enthusiastic showcase for the many men and women responsible for the burgeoning cocktail revolution going on in metropolises around the world.
m/hey_boo_harper_lee_and_to_kill_a_mockingbird, ...serves to remind us of a brilliantly written allegory that influenced social change. The documentary's side-effect is to make the viewer want to revisit both Harper Lee's book and film version.
m/hey_happy," Often demented in a good way, but it is an uneven film for the most part."
m/hey_hey_its_esther_blueburger," Appearances by Toni Collette and Whale Rider's Keisha Castle-Hughes should draw a few curious parents to what is, most of the time, a quirky and quite enjoyable coming of age saga."
m/hh-holmes-americas-first-serial-killer," A rather neat, independently-produced documentary about H.H. Holmes, America's first serial killer (don't ya just love descriptive movie titles?)"
m/hick_2012, The movie careers downhill with the speed of an unhinged kangaroo with one foot.
m/hickey_and_boggs," This was Culp's only venture into movie directing, and he handles the assignment well, and he and Cosby are both credible in their roles."
m/hickok_2017," Straightforward drama featuring ""Wild Bill"" Hickok is unlikely to impress theatre audiences but could come as a welcome surprise to genre fans on home-viewing platforms."
m/hidalgo," 'Hidalgo' sprawls way too far, and its ambitions considerably exceed its grasp."
m/hidden, Superior B-movie fare cleverly disguised as a Terminator rip-off.
m/hidden_2015, Hidden is a chamber piece spiked with apocalyptic sensibilities.
m/hidden_blade, An exceptional portrait of a samurai warrior who is a nurturing male.
m/hidden_figures," With an air of optimism and hope for the future, Hidden Figures is a balm for the current political landscape, inspiring audiences to stand up for their ideals and continue striving forward."
m/hide_away," It's basically just Lucas going through a short story-like period of reflection and redemption almost entirely without dialogue. It's not enough, but it is what this underappreciated actor does best."
m/hideous_kinky, Screenwriter Billy MacKinnon had to have struggled to write convincing dialogue about searching for spiritual enlightenment. Much of what comes out of Julia's mouth sounds like babble.
m/high-tension-switchblade-romance, [Haute Tension] is as intense as its French title suggests.
m/high_and_low, The pessimism that dominates the film becomes an oppressive turn-off.
m/high_and_the_mighty," Ocasionalmente promissor, acaba sendo prejudicado por sua narrativa lenta e por sua durao excessiva."
m/high_art," This affecting film is one of the year's more intriguing art-house entries, and doesn't deserve to be simply relegated to a niche audience."
m/high_crimes, There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending.
m/high_flying_bird," Though non-Americans may be bemused by the plot's basketball politics and backroom dealings, they will be rewarded by the rush of good acting and word-duelling."
m/high_ground_2012," Brown ... translates a collage of experiences - some desperate, some hopeful, all tragic - into a first-person commentary on the malign reverberations of war."
m/high_heels_and_lowlifes," A refreshingly engaging British movie that isn't afraid to go all out for laughs and thrills, leaving its social conscience behind."
m/high_life_2019," Claire Denis fills her frames with disturbing and occasionally repugnant images, but she's never cavalier or careless about them."
m/high_plains_drifter," Paint the town red, Clint. It's your strangest and one of your best westerns."
m/high_rise_2016," A complex, fluid interpretation which is respectful and almost-faithful while still being its own beautiful, crazed beast."
m/high_school_high," High School High has one or two genuine laughs with several chuckle-worthy moments peppered throughout, but this is pretty much a lackluster effort."
m/high_school_musical," Unless you have a kid under the age of seven, you'll probably find High School Musical a little too cheesy for its own good."
m/high_school_musical_2," Actually better than the first one... The songs are catchier, the comedy funnier, the attitudes sunnier."
m/high_sierra, The Bogie and Lupino performances were razor sharp.
m/high_society, The original story is bumbled but Cole Porter's original score is a welcome addition.
m/high_spirits," Although flawed with a hopelessly off-the-wall story and visual jokes that fall flat, there are still enough unique elements to warrant a viewing for the curious."
m/high_strung_2016," What it loses in thematic richness, the uncynical High Strung makes up for in pure joy."
m/higher_ground_2011," A spiritual drama that challenges viewers to map their own journey of faith, asking questions, having doubts, and seeking a closer connection with God."
m/higher_learning, It's an ambitious but unfocused effort which is admirable for its balanced perspective but leaves critical characters as mere representations of the stereotypes it seems to be challenging.
m/highlander," It's a lot of utterly preposterous fun, even if it doesn't quite hang together."
m/highlander_2_the_quickening, It would be best if we all just agree amongst ourselves that this movie never happened.
m/highlander_3_the_final_dimension," This is the end of the Highlander series, they say. Not an eon too soon."
m/highlander_endgame," A complete and utter mess. Disjointed, incoherent, boring, corny, filled with bad dialogue ... and that's just the first thirty minutes!"
m/highwater, [Director Dana] Brown's main talent is the way he blends stunning cinematography and crisp editing into you-are-there immediacy.
m/hilary_and_jackie, The story is told in such a chopped-up way that it often seems pointless and certainly devoid of much-needed editing.
m/hillarys_america_the_secret_history_of_the_democratic_party," A searing, powerful and persuasive expos. Consider it your patriotic duty to see it! You'll never look at Hillary Clinton the same way again."
m/hills_have_eyes," Dogs are disemboweled, parakeets become tasty beverages, and actresses Emilie de Ravin and Vinessa Shaw are virtually raped on screen."
m/hills_have_eyes_2," It is only another by-the-numbers, don't-mess-with-the-formula screen filler aimed at the gore-hound fan boys who sustain all these franchises while bemoaning their sameness."
m/hills_have_eyes_the_pt_2, The original was a minor classic. This is just minor.
m/hillsong_let_hope_rise," ""God created music for the sole purpose to connect the human heart, our soul, with heaven,"" Joel says. Perhaps, but these tunes won't keep you awake."
m/himalaya, Seeing Himalaya is to bear witness to a proud and rich people.
m/himizu," Sono's latest is overlong and fidgety, but puts its post-Fukushima context to good use."
m/hip_hop_project," the bottom line is that Kazi and his cohorts would be even better served by a film that was more than only intermittently involving, and The Hip Hop Project is not that film."
m/hipsters," While everything looks glinty and gorgeous, the story's political edge is dulled by excessive levity."
m/hiroshima_mon_amour," Integrating past and present, poetic images and documentary footage, music and Marguerite Duras' dialogue, the film achieved a structural balance of such emotional and intellectual power that audiences were stunned."
m/his_dark_materials_the_golden_compass, Screenwriter/director Chris Weitz's spotty filmic adaptation never locates a throughline to the convoluted narrative.
m/his_girl_friday," His Girl Friday (1940) is Howard Hawks' speedy and hysterically funny screwball comedy, and one of the best examples of its kind in film history"
m/historias_que_so_existem_quando_lembradas," Julia Murat shows a fine grasp of form, letting her technique reflect the elements and moods of her story."
m/history_boys," Having created this moral confusion for the audience, Bennett sweeps it all away with a mushy, sentimental ending that would seem tidy if we weren't all too aware of the pile of dirt the playwright left under the bed."
m/history_of_the_world_part_i," It succeeds only in fits and starts, but the bits that do work are hilarious!"
m/history_of_violence, At nearly every turn the filmmaking weakens the story's sense of purpose rather than bringing to life intriguing themes concerning identity and self-preservation.
m/hit_and_run_2012," The rom-com/car chase back-and-forth doesn't always work, but a fun story and affable cast keep things moving fluidly."
m/hit_and_runway, Filled with elements that should set off alarms for anyone who's seen too many indie films.
m/hit_by_lightning," From its uninspired, sitcom-y look to its phoned-in dialogue (""I love you + infinity""; ""I love you + double infinity"") to its creaky plot, ""Hit by Lightning"" is anything but electrifying."
m/hit_so_hard_2012," Though stylistically incoherent at times, pic benefits from the percussionist's plainspokenness."
m/hitch," The sour subplot, in which Sara's dark side mistakes Hitch for a cad, staggers to a gummy resolution, throwing a wet-blanket reminder that romantic comedy -- indeed, romance itself -- isn't what it used to be."
m/hitchcock," Hitchcock might be a work of fantasy and speculation as much as it is history and biography, but as an interpretation of a major talent's inner life and imagination, it's undeniably lively and provocative."
m/hitchcocktruffaut, An entertaining gateway to a great book and Hitchcock's oeuvre.
m/hitcher," Meyers appears to appreciate the basic fundamentals of genre filmmaking, and lets his Hitcher out to play, instead of suffocating the whole thing in hip visuals and flash-cut edit rhythms."
m/hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy," That's not to say that the film sucked, just that...it wasn't my kind of movie or humor."
m/hitler_the_last_ten_days, [Hitler: The Last Ten Days] offers neither instruction nor entertainment.
m/hitlers_children_2012, How these men and women have chosen to face this inherited burden directly or flee from it creates a fascinating spectrum the film explores via quietly intimate interviews.
m/hitman, A movie so bland it's hard to believe it was inspired by anything more than a Wikipedia entry on 'action thrillers.'
m/hitman_agent_47," Hitman: Agent 47 is sometimes as handsome as its title character, but nowhere near as capable."
m/hobbit, For a made for TV movie from the 70's I was impressed.
m/hobo_with_a_shotgun," Takes exactly the right tone, straddling the line between imitation and parody."
m/hockney, You don't need to be a fan of the artist to enjoy this spirited celebration of his life and art. But you may end up a fan afterward.
m/hocus_pocus," Chock-full of visual tricks and treats, Hocus Pocus is actually just what its title implies -- cinematic chimera without much substance."
m/hoffa," Danny De Vito's Hoffa is artfully constructed, masterfully played, and travels at speeds beyond the prescriptive norm."
m/hold_the_dark," The story doesn't entirely hold together after the fact... but as is typical for Saulnier, it's shocking and moving while it's actually going on."
m/holding_the_man," The film's commanding achievement is probably tonal: there is a warm, sensual flow to it, with production values that feel amorous and tactile."
m/holding_trevor," In Holding Trevor, there's a depressed form of anger bubbling beneath the surface."
m/hole_in_my_heart, Sends your brain whirring as well as your stomach churning -- quite a feat.
m/holes," One of the few recent movies I have seen that plunged me into that rare, giddy state of pleasurable confusion, of not knowing what would happen next, which I associate with the reading and moviegoing experiences of my own childhood."
m/holiday," This is my favorite George Cukor movie, and a perennial New Year's Eve classic."
m/holiday_in_the_wild, It's a nicey-nice movie and hollow but there's an audience for it somewhere
m/holiday_inn," Call it old-fashioned or old Hollywood fluff, Holiday Inn is a sweet, pleasant slice of another time in pop entertainment."
m/holidays," Seeing how visionaries new and old foster an idea of things that go bump in the night is what keeps viewers coming back for more, and when anthologies add as many twists as Holidays, aficionados are always ready for the next installment."
m/hollow_2012," Generates a suitably creepy atmosphere and pulls off a couple of decent scary moments, but the found-footage conceit wears very thin and the plot never really comes together."
m/hollow_man, Verhoeven -- no doubt alarmed by the poor box-office showing of his last few films -- is clearly out to pander to a teenage audience.
m/hollow_man_2," Essentially a goofy little matinee flick for the FX geeks and the schlock-obsessed sequel-lovers, HM2 isn't nearly as bad as it could have been ... but it's pretty darn disposable all the same."
m/holly," Newcomer Thuy Nguyen, only 14 during production, holds her own with natural aplomb."
m/hollywood_ending, Just the film that could help revive the sluggish New York tourist industry.
m/hollywood_homicide, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett are...a veritably delightful and likable duo that mesh surprisingly well with each other.
m/hollywood_knights," One horrendous film--a shapeless, formless mess with little story and even less sense."
m/hollywood_shuffle," For a mere $100,000, Townsend and company have made a funny, poignant and technically proficient film -- one that should thoroughly embarrass those studios that routinely offer up badly made, multimillion-dollar disasters."
m/hollywoodland," A thoroughly involving modern noir, filled with hard-boiled dialogue and ambiguous characters - + it proves what a great actor Affleck is!"
m/holmes_and_watson_2018, It's just frustrating that Holmes and Watson has a handful of moments of genuine comic lunacy - a seconds-long Elephant Man cameo is inspired - but all they really do is highlight the laziness and lack of laughs in the rest of the film.
m/holy_man, The film never really explains where G came from or where he's going.
m/holy_motors," Full of references that are vaguely aligned (at least in his mind) with the ethereal fantasy of the afterlife as a place to borrow ghosts for re-enactment of certain scenes, usually dramatic or deadly"
m/holy_mountain," The mise-en-scene is packed with colorful, often shocking images (blood and body wastes are recurring motifs) but orchestrated in a creative delirium."
m/holy_rollers," Weaves a quiet, ethnographic spell, highlighted by a brave and detailed central performance from Jesse Eisenberg."
m/holy_smoke," The film doesn't make it easy to read his or her recovery, or whether salvation is even possible in this world."
m/home_2013, Oliver is off to a promising start. Let's hope it's enough to get his next go-round a wider theatrical release.
m/home_2015," There may be no place like home, but there are a lot of places like Home, an animated adventure about the unlikely friendship between a lonely girl and an alien misfit that can't help but feel familiar."
m/home_again_2017, Here's a mainstream romantic comedy where the romance isn't that important and where the woman makes all of the decisions - both in front of and behind the camera.
m/home_alone," Forget the cartoonish bad guys, this film is about overcoming fears and taking control of your life."
m/home_alone_2_lost_in_new_york, Whatever steam Culkin gained in Home Alone was lost in this tepid sequel rehash.
m/home_alone_3, [John Hughes] figures he didn't need any surprises: Just take the blueprint for the first of the series and slip it in the copying machine.
m/home_at_the_end_of_the_world," Compassionate and touching, but less complex and resonant than the book."
m/home_fries," What's interesting is pretty much unintentional, centering in the film's performances, which are excellent indeed."
m/home_from_the_hill," Along with Some Came Running, it ranks as Minnelli's finest family melodrama, lurid and flamboyant yet also deeply emotional and incisive in its critique of the patriarchal order; Robert Mitchum as the patriarch is superb."
m/home_of_the_brave," For all its relevance to the state of the nation, Home of the Brave is convinced it's saying something urgent but offers no fresh insight to postwar survival."
m/home_on_the_range, Doesn't rise above anything you're likely to see on an average Saturday morning.
m/home_room," At 133 minutes, Home Room is sluggishly paced and refuses to lighten up for even a second."
m/home_run_2013, Almost from the beginning the message overwhelms the medium.
m/home_sweet_hell," A bit on the nose, but Heigl hits the mark in a role that seems tailor made for her."
m/homecoming_a_film_by_beyonce," A euphoric, triumphant, and exhaustingly fierce documentary that should help see Beychella enshrined as one of the definitive pop culture events of the century. Call it history in the making, part two."
m/homefront, Jason Statham squares off against poor white trash in an old Sylvester Stallone script that should have stayed on the shelf.
m/homer_and_eddie," There's a deep sense of desperation in Homer and Eddie, its stars clawing at the screen in hopes of reminding the audience that hey, we're not just comedians."
m/homeward_bound_2_lost_in_san_francisco," Full of the cute doggie tricks, big noisy adventure sequences and the usual anthropomorphic bits of action and dialogue that children will love."
m/homeward_bound_the_incredible_journey, This film will appeal to anyone of any age who doesn't have a heart of stone.
m/homicidal, This devious little gem is an inspired twist on its inspiration...
m/hondo," Aside from the films of Howard Hawks and John Ford, this is arguably John Wayne's best and most beloved Western"
m/hondros," If the movie doesn't go more than skin deep in interrogating questions about interventions both military and journalistic into the Middle East, it does succeed in opening up Mr. Hondros's contradiction-filled world."
m/honey," ""Honey"" is aimed directly at the teen crowd and offers enough handsome characters, hip-hop songs and energetic dancing to keep the demographic happy."
m/honey_2," For all its killer choreography, alas, it's clear this genre urgently needs some new moves of its own."
m/honey_i_blew_up_the_kid, ...abandons the first film's sense of character and leans more heavily toward gimmick.
m/honey_i_shrunk_the_kids, This Disneyfied version of The Incredible Shrinking Man isn't so bad -- it at least features some reasonable special effects.
m/honeydripper," The film does feature a host of interesting characters and, as always with Sayles, the dialogue has more than a few zingers."
m/honeyglue," Honeyglue has a very good movie inside it, but decisions brought on by inexperience prevent it from sprouting its wings."
m/honeymoon_2014, [Honeymoon] delivers real unease despite a well-tread plot.
m/honeymoon_in_vegas," Comedy version of, 'Indecent Proposal.' Oddly enough, both of them are equally stupid."
m/honeymoon_killers, t's hard to see whether director Kastle has attempted a semi-documentary or a schlock-horror number. The film has elements of both and often slides into kitsch.
m/honkytonk_man," Uneven, indulgent and overlong, but, perversely, it still has a few good moments: the appearance of the some country greats, Eastwood's character trying to sing through his illness, the picturesque scenery."
m/hoodwinked_too_hood_vs_evil," Despite ample proof to the contrary, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil was not written by the punaholic Carrie Bradshaw."
m/hook, Hook breaks the cardinal rule of J.M. Barrie's timeless fantasy -- it grows up.
m/hooked_2018," Many forced, unconvincing situations...unfold as Emerson struggles to paint a meaningful social portrait, one that often feels surprisingly retro and clichd from a guy who seems pretty hip on YouTube."
m/hooking_up_2020, For a comedy that brushes up against serious social problems-sexual addiction and cancer battles-the film makes unthoughtful misstep after unthoughtful misstep.
m/hoop_dreams," A film that is so rich, so involving, so compelling... that superlatives seem inadequate."
m/hoosiers," Even though we've seen it all before, Hoosiers scores big by staying small."
m/hoot, Hoot tells a corny but gently humorous can-do tale of three Florida kids who help save a family of burrowing owls.
m/hop_2011," It goes through the motions provoking a few chuckles, yet wastes Brand's flamboyant way with words by keeping him nailed down to the script."
m/hope_floats," This material could obviously lead in a lot of different directions. It seems most promising as comedy or satire, but no: Hope Floats is a turgid melodrama with the emotional range of a sympathy card."
m/hope_springs," Ultimately it's the wholly unbelievable -- and frankly, impossible -- story that makes Hope Springs fail to work in virtually every scene."
m/hope_springs_2012," The therapy in Maine with recommended intimacy exercises for a couple married 31 years will be found hysterically funny by some, embarrassing by others, and for me, well-acted and simply amusing."
m/hope_springs_eternal_2018," A funny, occasionally poignant ""Fault in Our Stars"" send-up that's too short for its own good."
m/hopscotch, Bond on valium? This game of Hopscotch is a low-key but entertaining affair.
m/hornblower-the-examination-for-lieutenant-horatio-hornblower-the-fire-ship," The episode ends with rousing heroism, as the hero climbs aboard a burning ship to alter its course and save the endangered fleet."
m/horns," Predominantly a failure of tone, ""Horns"" has plenty of admirable traits and yet dooms itself from the outset. It's an admirable conceit stuffed into far less subtle material."
m/horrible_bosses," It could almost be argued that Horrible Bosses' general middle of the road, vanilla, just-good-enough nature is actually on purpose, a reflection of the lead characters' own qualities."
m/horrible_bosses_2," There's a sense here of making hay while the sun shines: just as the characters wing their way through their ill-conceived plan with a wink and a smile, so do the filmmakers."
m/horrid_henry_the_movie, 'Horrid Henry' is indelibly flawed and disorderly in tone but not devoid of rambunctious charm.
m/horror_2015," #Horror has plenty to say about cyberbullying, but it gets lost in frantic editing and bitchy stereotypes along the way."
m/horror_express," This Spanish production is one of the most entertaining and well-plotted horror films of the 1970s, boasts great acting, plenty of gruesome gore and%u2014best yet%u2014Telly Savalas."
m/horror_of_dracula, It may have slipped from an X rating to a 12A but this is still a potent adaptation of Bran Stoker's eternal monster.
m/hors_la_loi_2010," Whenever the film starts to feel too locked in by its plotting, Bouchareb introduces a new element of moral queasiness to upset the easy balance."
m/horse_girl," Ambitious, but muddled, but also featuring a stellar performance from Alison Brie."
m/horse_soldiers," Though not one of John Ford-John Wayne's best collaborations, this Civil War Western has some merits, primarily visual, but also thematic in positing the military (Wayne) verus the medical profession (William Holden) in terms of civic and personal duty"
m/horse_whisperer," has much in common with 'The Electric Horseman,' Redford's popular 1979 vehicle ...But while 'Horseman' was a feel-good formula picture, 'Whisperer' is aiming for something much deeper and truer."
m/horton-hears-a-who2008," A delight, brimming with colorful, elastic characters and bountiful wit."
m/hospital," This darkly humorous satire of an urban hospital is probably the only decent movie that Arthur Hiller had directed, benefiting from Chayefsky's Oscar winning script."
m/hospitality," The derivative screenplay lacking wit and the filmmaking devoid of arresting style, Hospitality never gather narrative momentum despite its frequent plot developments."
m/hostel," Slide in, belt up, and hang on: Hostel is the horror movie equivalent of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride!"
m/hostel_2," Part II is vile, but it commits an even worse sin by being so aggressively boring and hilariously one-note."
m/hostile_2017," There is a touching climax to the film ... a rarity in a movie that also features monstrosities roaming the desert like extras in The Descent, so worth sticking with for the duration."
m/hostiles," ""Hostiles"" finds its footing as it begins to reckon with the moral underpinnings of the Western genre."
m/hot_air_2019, A film that begins as a topical expose of polarizing media personalities eventually succumbs to predictably sentimental clichés.
m/hot_chick," When it tries to be funny it's usually appalling, but when it attempts to be sweet it's truly nauseating."
m/hot_fuzz," It's not a perfect template - running motifs are glaringly flagged up and there are at least two too many climaxes - but for both gags and thrills, few current British filmmakers come close."
m/hot_rod, Samberg's penchant for subversively silly asides certainly hints that he's capable of being more than a Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler clone. Now he just needs to find a film that won't fall apart around him.
m/hot_shots_part_deux," On the whole, feels less satisfying than the original."
m/hot_summer_nights," Hot Summer Nights is a sneaky slice of dark Americana, a gorgeously shot, hard truth coming-of-age tale rendered through a lens of innocence and grandeur, a sexy 20th century fairy tale."
m/hot_to_trot," Hot to Trot is a movie to make ninnies whinny, audiences gag and horses hide their heads."
m/hot_tub_time_machine, The 'Hangover' of home-appliance time-travel comedies.
m/hot_tub_time_machine_2, It's terribly easy to screw up a moderately good thing by making an inferior sequel.
m/hotel_2003, Pulls the conventions of conventional film-making apart right before our eyes and gives a glimpse of the future of narrative cinema.
m/hotel_artemis," [Writer and director Drew Pearce] flaps around for a consistent tone, stunts some potential story lines and kicks out a bunch of cliches."
m/hotel_for_dogs," Adapted from Lois Duncan's popular children's book, it's doggie-thumbs up to this fresh and breezy family-friendly film that not only tells its delightfully inventive story well, but is ultra cute to boot"
m/hotel_mumbai, Instead of eliciting a moving or joyous response it feels somewhat off-putting. And that certainly could not be what Maras or Collee had in mind.
m/hotel_new_hampshire, So-so John Irving adaptation suffers from cinematic schizophrenia.
m/hotel_rwanda," Both tough and tender, the movingly rendered production often strikes a devastating chord without resorting to any of the manipulative string-pulling known to accompany movies about 'men who made a difference.'"
m/hotel_transylvania," 'Hotel Transylvania' caters to the MTV generation's lack of attention, and blitzes through the gates without a breath."
m/hotel_transylvania_2, Genndy Tartakovsky is a talented director who knows how to telegraph what an animated character is thinking and doing and how to move a character in ways that suggest personality. He deserves a more interesting assignment.
m/hotel_transylvania_3_summer_vacation," Thankfully, this colourful, enjoyable lark is not a case of diminishing returns for this energetic troupe, the shift of scenery offering plenty of opportunities for the brand's signature style of animated slapstick"
m/hottie_and_the_nottie," It's hard to fault the filmmakers, because given the premise, it could have been much MUCH worse."
m/hounds_of_love," Hounds of Love benefits from impressive control of visuals to build suspense and from the spiky performances of its fearless cast, flagging Young as a talent to watch."
m/hour_of_the_gun," ...a plodding, turgid affair, drained of life or momentum by an enveloping morbidity..."
m/hour_of_the_wolf, A must for fans of horror and of Bergman. So good it makes you wish he had dabbled in the genre that bit more often.
m/hours, Considerable intelligence and strategic finesse have been brought to bear on this handsomely mounted adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
m/hours_2013," An ingeniously simple setup is cunningly exploited for maximum suspense in Hours, a slow-building, consistently engrossing drama."
m/house_2_the_second_story," House II doesn't even have much true horror, and the stuff we do get is decidedly tame in contrast to the rest of the series."
m/house_at_the_end_of_the_street," The kind of bland, mediocre thriller that's tough to review in the sense that it's difficult to put a shoulder shrug into words. How can I turn ""meh"" into a full review?"
m/house_bunny, What else can you say about a movie when Christopher McDonald counting to 30 is the funniest thing that happens in it?
m/house_by_the_river," Full of Victorian adornments, shadowy lighting and morbid moods, it is a desperate attempt to raise goose-flesh with a standard horror-psychological plot."
m/house_in_the_alley, Effectively creepy psychological horror that doesn't rely on gore.
m/house_of_1000_corpses, Succesfully playing a zombie onstage doesn't take the place of a few basic courses in Film School.
m/house_of_cardin," House of Cardin encapsulates how one man became an empire, one that continues to thrive even as he approaches a century of life on this planet."
m/house_of_d," The film looks and feels authentic, but Duchovny has powered his undeniably personal journey with a counterfeit heart."
m/house_of_dark_shadows, It has the unique distinction of being the only motion picture ever based on a daytime soap opera.
m/house_of_dracula, This becomes just a silly excuse to provide audiences with cheap scares.
m/house_of_exorcism," The Bava art on full display, voluptuous and oneiric"
m/house_of_flying_daggers, ...a lot of the stuff started to feel a little too melodramatic and just didn't click for me.
m/house_of_fools," Konchalovsky keeps the action reasonably quick, but sentimental storytelling eventually swamps the picture."
m/house_of_frankenstein, A wonderful Universal B-horror; the first of the all-star monster fests. Lots of fun with J. Carrol Naish almost stealing the show as the hunchback Daniel.
m/house_of_games," O roteiro  mais previsvel do que Mamet desejaria e seu primeiro trabalho na direo exibe uma teatralidade que ele gradualmente superaria, mas, apesar disso, a complexidade de seus personagens e a dinmica de seus dilogos so admirveis."
m/house_of_hummingbird," Bora certainly knows the nuances of her subject inwards and out and makes sure that we know there is no hero or villain, simply a family trying to find its way around each other."
m/house_of_pleasures," Among other things, a sharp corrective to such effervescent red-light classics as Max Ophls's ""Le Plaisir."""
m/house_of_sand_and_fog," The carefully laid foundation of suspense and dread, with its symmetries and crisp dialogue, is squandered in a clumsy pileup of credulity-stretching cataclysmic events."
m/house_of_wax_2005," The characters are about as intelligent as their waxen alter-egos, making it impossible to care too much about what happens to them."
m/house_of_yes," Presumably it worked far better onstage, where MacLeod's absurdist tale and self-conscious, Beckett-like wordplay probably found a friendlier context."
m/house_on_92nd_street, Provides a somewhat accurate historical framework for the period.
m/house_on_sorority_row," If you've never experienced the horrors of what happened that fateful evening at the Pi Theta House, this would definitely be an excellent introduction."
m/house_on_willow_street," Not quite enough here to fill its admittedly short running time, but the themes and visuals offer some nightmarish distractions from your day."
m/house_party," The first--and best--of the three black comedies made of the same concept, this joyful picture was far less cloying than its white counterpart movies of the 1960s."
m/house_party_2," House Party 2 is a genial and good-humored sequel to the surprise 1990 hit, but not much more."
m/house_party_3," Nope, not even bad enough to be the final installment."
m/house_that_dripped_blood," One of the best of the Amicus portmanteau films, this relies on Robert Bloch's superior scripting abilities to fashion a chilling atmosphere of terror that has dated extremely well."
m/houseboat," Innocent romantic comedy isn't one of Grant's best, but he and Loren make for interesting watching in close quarters."
m/housebound," unfolds in a borderland (on the Twin Coasts Highway!) between the ghostly and the physical, the eerily uncanny and the hilariously banal... Spending nearly two hours in the house with this extended and dysfunctional family is more joy than sentence."
m/housesitter, It's like a game of charades that goes on way too long at a dinner party nobody wanted to attend in the first place.
m/hover, Hover is an expertly crafted horror film focusing on a future almost too close to home.
m/how_do_you_know," How Do You Know is a terrible title for a not-much-better movie, missing a question mark and most of the point with romantic comedies. James L. Brooks' film is rarely romantic and barely amusing, dashing any hope that Spanglish was just a fluke."
m/how_green_was_my_valley," If not for the inevitable comparisons to Citizen Kane, How Green Was My Valley might have aged better."
m/how_high, It begs the response that seems to have been the moviemakers' mantra: 'Whatever.'
m/how_i_ended_this_summer," Playing an ignoble protagonist, Dobrygin keeps his motives always quietly evident; later, lost in a fog painted red by an emergency flare, he's an abject vision of man in a hell of his own making."
m/how_i_live_now, Proof there can still be boring stories during extraordinary times.
m/how_it_ends, How It Ends would have been well served to ask itself a few big questions.
m/how_murray_saved_christmas, It's the kind of special that harried parents may want to turn on for their own tired parents to help babysit the kids. They'll enjoy the extended tribute to milkmen.
m/how_she_move," For once, the movie -- written by Annmarie Morais and directed by Ian Iqbal Rashid with a gritty overlay of 16mm grain -- regards book learning as at least as important as physical prowess."
m/how_stella_got_her_groove_back," It takes a long, long time for our Stella to finally get her groove back, and by then you might not much care."
m/how_sweet_it_is_2013," How Sweet It Is may be sweet in spirit, but as a movie it isn't so, you know, sweet."
m/how_the_grinch_stole_christmas," If you truly love Theodor Seuss Geisel and wish to honor his memory, stick with the book and the cartoon."
m/how_the_west_was_won, Delivered big with breathtaking location work and an all-star cast...
m/how_to_be_a_latin_lover, I like everyone connected with this movie so much that I am especially sorry to give it a bad review.
m/how_to_be_a_player, This one hurt...and they did not do women right in these movies...
m/how_to_be_single_2016," Beneath its vulgar humor and crazy situations, the movie shows in a lucid way and consciously the universe of the contemporary woman. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/how_to_build_a_girl_2020," With a fantastic soundtrack and quippy one-liners, How to Build A Girl is thoroughly entertaining even when it gets gritty and mean."
m/how_to_change_the_world, All of it is calculated to provide easily detectable dramatic beats.
m/how_to_cook_your_life," Tasteful in more ways than one, mischievous and charming docu How to Cook Your Life serves up a heapin' helping of Zen."
m/how_to_deal, Producers smooshed the plots of two Sarah Dessen teen novels into one flick.
m/how_to_die_in_oregon, A poignant plea for acceptance of patient aid-in-dying.
m/how_to_eat_fried_worms," Fried Worms' appeal is right there in its title, only the second-best title of the month (after Snakes on a Plane) but still maybe the second-best title of all time."
m/how_to_eat_your_watermelon_in_white_company_2005, ... offers a solid overview of the pioneering African-American filmmaker's wide-ranging career.
m/how_to_live_forever," An entertaining and thought-provoking documentary that offers a global examination of longevity, centenarians, and the growing market for anti-aging products."
m/how_to_lose_a_guy_in_10_days, This boy-meets-girl movie is a chore to sit through.
m/how_to_lose_friends_and_alienate_people, How to lose friends and alienate audiences is the lesson taught by this cleverly titled but noxious British comedy.
m/how_to_make_an_american_quilt," Despite its hard-sell coming attraction and pot-smoking granny singing rock oldies, How to Make an American Quilt turns out to be a wealth of old-style Hollywood magic."
m/how_to_make_money_selling_drugs," It's a smart, funny, tough-minded film crammed with data and personal anecdotes ..."
m/how_to_marry_a_millionaire," Starring Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall, Fox's hugely popular hit was the first comedy to be shot in CinemaScope and the second film ever to use this format."
m/how_to_murder_your_wife," Lemmon est timo como sempre, e Lisi  belssima, mas o fraco roteiro e a ridcula concluso comprometem o filme irremediavelmente."
m/how_to_rob_a_bank, It seems especially depressing when so-called independent filmmakers have nothing on their minds except aping the style of Hollywood's hip caper movies.
m/how_to_survive_a_plague, A documentary on the impact of a passionate group of dedicated and creative individuals in raising awareness of the AIDS epidemic.
m/how_to_talk_to_girls_at_parties, There's too little narrative cohesion or persuasive subtext to make this much more than a low-budget folly that's outre without always being terribly interesting.
m/how_to_train_your_dragon," It has winningly Potteresque teen-dragon-slayer classes, a queen-bee dragon as grand as Godzilla, and a layer of age-of-terror allegory about the ignorance bred by jingoism."
m/how_to_train_your_dragon_2," DeBlois' powers haven't diminished ... he dares to go deeper, smarter and even darker, honing in on the elements that made the first film work."
m/how_to_train_your_dragon_the_hidden_world," Every bit as thrilling and entertaining as its predecessors, but with greater finesse in both visuals and storytelling to create a sublime swan song that will likely leave you in a mess of tears."
m/howard_the_duck, ...a hopelessly uneven and needlessly frenetic piece of work that's unlikely to hold much appeal for viewers over a certain age...
m/howard_zinn_you_cant_be_neutral_on_a_moving_train," This is a fine biography about a truly good, brave and honest man but it is also an incredibly detailed history lesson"
m/howards_end," Hopkins, as the Wilcox patriarch, is a combination of sensitivity and intractableness, turning in a modulated performance that dispels all lurid memories of Hannibal Lecter."
m/howling," 'La la la, let me walk in the woods and find out what that dreadful noise is.'"
m/howling_iii_the_marsupials," The third of the Howling series is also the least reverential to Joe Dante's original horror movie, with Philippe Mora's tongue firmly in his cheek from the opening credits"
m/howling_reborn, A decent time killer with strong performances and a good head on its shoulder.
m/howls_moving_castle, The straightforward narrative constantly seems at odds with Miyazaki's dreamy landscapes and fanciful flourishes.
m/hubble_3d, The newly resurgent 3D format gets an out-of-this-world showcase in Hubble 3D.
m/hudson_hawk, To say this megamillion Bruce Willis vehicle doesn't fly is understatement in the extreme.
m/hudsucker_proxy, Not even the slightest attempt is made to suggest that the film takes its own story seriously. Everything is style. The performances seem deliberately angled as satire.
m/hugh_hefner_playboy_activist_and_rebel, A revealing portrait of the freedom-fighting man beneath the silk pajamas.
m/hugo, Arthur C. Clarke once wrote that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' It's a sentiment that Scorsese seems to have taken to heart...
m/hulk, A nerdish scientist unleashes his monstrous inner child in this thoughtful superhero movie from director Ang Lee.
m/hulk_vs, It probably ranks higher than either of the live-action Hulk movies: at once humbler in its aims and keener in its understanding of the character.
m/human_capital, It gives the tired trope of cutting between overlapping stories a welcome shot of adrenaline.
m/human_capital_2020, Human Capital is a human interest drama without much interest.
m/human_centipede," Once Six gets the girls inside Dr. Heiter's ultra chic pad, what he offers is a more sophisticated study of unchecked aggression than Eli Roth is capable of."
m/human_flow," As DeMillean in scope as it is radical in its call to compassion, it's basically The Ten Commandments of dissident art."
m/human_stain," Without the sardonic rant of Philip Roth, upon whose novel the film is based, the material plays as stale or preposterous."
m/human_traffic," ...a sharp, witty, and fast-paced look at the rave life."
m/humanoids_from_the_deep, Takes the theme of the Julie Adams-lusting 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' to an extreme that the censors would not have allowed in the 1950s...
m/humboldt_county," While the concept of the movie is tuned into all those warm, important questions of purpose, the execution lacks gravity, making the picture one long, slow spiral into melodramatic hogwash."
m/hummus_the_movie," The fun film includes ongoing 'Guinness Book of World Records' challenges concerning the world's largest platter. And -- oh my gosh! -- Abu Gosh, an Arab-Israeli village with an astounding 20 restaurants in it -- might even take the cake!"
m/humoresque, pot-boiler with Crawford chewing up the scenery; Garfield does his best to retain his dignity.
m/humpday," The title suggests a titillating, frivolous film, but it's actually a serio comedy about socio-sexual taboos and the very nature of male friendship."
m/hunger_2008," Despite the filth, the violence and the desolation, McQueen's portrait is a thing of brutal beauty in terms of its composition."
m/hungry_hearts_2014," It took ahold of my mind in such a way that I found myself constantly thinking about it long after the screening. I couldn't get its images out of my head, its twisted tale of unconventional horror making me feel uncomfortable long after the credits."
m/hunky_dory, This relatively standard nostalgic teen drama holds our interest through its colourful settings and characters.
m/hunt_for_red_october," With a sharp eye for building tension and edgy editing that forces audience attention from distraction, McTiernan's Hunt should more than satisfy its audience."
m/hunt_for_the_wilderpeople," A sweetly-told, laugh-out-loud adventure that reminds us you're never too young or too old to find someone to love who'll also love you back."
m/hunter_gatherer, Josh Locy makes a beguiling directing debut with this curious tale of an ex-con trying to get his life back on track.
m/hunter_killer," The pacing seems intentionally designed to break your spirits, with a climactic set-piece that rages on forever, despite being comprised of nothing but shouting and torpedos."
m/hunting_elephants," 'Hunting for Elephants' is burdened by a truly horrendous, screechingly anti-feminist screenplay with so many holes in it that it's impossible to believe from the get-go, let alone want to believe."
m/hurry-sundown," Otto Preminger's Hurry Sundown is a frustrating case, not good but not particularly bad, with a smokescreen of controversy surrounding it and obscuring its real faults."
m/husbands," as a time capsule rendition of men being boys, it certainly has an inherent intrigue, but it is not one of Cassavetes' strongest films"
m/hush_2016, Flanagan's taut direction reinforces his rep as an up-and-comer we will hopefully be hearing much more from.
m/hushhush_sweet_charlotte," Davis has some authentic, poignant moments, before all hell breaks loose."
m/hustle_and_flow," A timeless and well-made story of personal redemption, enhanced by Howard's breakthrough performance and winning turns from every single supporting cast member."
m/hustler, This is the purest examination of an athlete's internal struggle ever mounted for the screen.
m/hustlers, These stories collectively amount to little more than a portrait of rural life as a redneck nightmare wherein people are very stupid or very evil.
m/hustlers_2019," Hustlers focuses the women of the strip club, but the fire roars loud enough to transcend this world and wake up a viewer in any other situation that could feel any similar floodlit rage."
m/hwal_2005," The evolution of the plot and the psychology of the characters are developed with a perfect progression, which results in something almost imperceptible, subtle and harmonious. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/hybrid_2001," For most of its running time, Hybrid is as remote and cold and boring as its subject."
m/hyde_park_on_hudson," Bill Murray as FDR? It takes a few minutes to get used to, but once he settles into the role of the 32nd president, the idiosyncratic comic actor does a wonderfully jaunty job of it ..."
m/hyena_road," The strategy was sound, but the script proves clunky on screen because it's clad in a heavy armor of thought and doesn't leave enough gaps for the subtle nuances and offhand gestures that make characters feel entirely real."
m/hype," The filmmakers also made a wise choice in not overlaying Hype! with the judgmental edge of a narrator. They merely allow the participants to tell their remarkable story, through music and words."
m/hysteria_2012," Though the film is a fairly plastic British period piece with all the intimacy of a Hitachi Wand, the script captures some delicate and intelligent facets of a tensely conflicted era."
m/i-want-candy," Billed as 'The British American Pie', a label applied apparently without irony."
m/i_am_a_fugitive_from_a_chain_gang, [A] difficult and heart-wrenching story of justice perverted.
m/i_am_a_sex_addict," Were the articulate director a less obnoxious presence, he might have just pulled off his audaciously self-conscious endeavor."
m/i_am_ali," It doesn't break any new ground, not does it claim to, but it's likable and reasonably thorough."
m/i_am_big_bird_the_caroll_spinney_story," This sweet if superfluous doc shows that Spinney is Big Bird, a tireless performer who refuses to retire."
m/i_am_bolt," If Bolt's talent continues to defy all explanation, the Turner brothers bring us close enough to it to witness bugs swarming over nerveless knuckles on the start line."
m/i_am_bruce_lee_2012," Whether you're a mixed martial arts fan, a kung fu movie junkie or a pop culture enthusiast enthralled by Lee's iconic image, you'll find something in ""I Am Bruce Lee"" to enjoy."
m/i_am_chris_farley," The movie is saccharine. The tone is set from the get-go by that lazy, obsequious title - it sounds like some bogus self-help seminar that one of Farley's characters would have smashed to smithereens."
m/i_am_david," The film is marred by too many coincidences, but there are a couple of twists at the end that tug at the heartstrings and leave you with a warm feeling."
m/i_am_divine, It made me fall in love with Divine all over again.
m/i_am_heath_ledger, A stirring tribute fittingly seen through the eyes of the artist himself.
m/i_am_jonas," Boys (Jonas) may be a TV movie, but it still suggests that its writer/director has a bright future ahead of him on the big screen."
m/i_am_legend," The film can never quite decide whether it's speculative fiction or a B-movie horror show. It's not a fatal flaw, though."
m/i_am_love, Tilda Swinton unleashes her diva and Italian cinema gets a powerful new voice in this operatic melodrama.
m/i_am_michael," Thankfully, the screenplay doesn't portray the story in simple terms of good or evil but that doesn't mean that there's quite enough nuance or insight to constantly elevate the material above the level of a well-made but TV-ready biopic."
m/i_am_mother," An uncommonly ambitious feature debut with impressive design work, sharp visual effects, a fabulous A.I. creation and a compelling lead performance from talented Danish newcomer Clara Rugaard."
m/i_am_not_a_serial_killer," Breathtakingly innovative, delightfully ghoulish, and insightfully unconventional."
m/i_am_not_an_easy_man," I Am Not An Easy Man has some winning portions in the strong comedic moments and Ferdane's spectacular performance, but ultimately its interesting concept goes nowhere."
m/i_am_not_your_negro," Narrated by a restrained and unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson, the film presents a compelling case of history that is still just as relevant and prudent today."
m/i_am_number_four," Four is a tease, promising muscular genre goods it never delivers, led by a painfully robotic performance from English actor Pettyfer, who spends the entirety of his screentime fussing with his unconvincing American accent."
m/i_am_richard_pryor, I Am Richard Pryor presents a sincere and moving account of the comedian/actor's life and career.
m/i_am_sam," A sweet endearing tearjerker, with Beatle's tribute soundtrack. I loved it."
m/i_am_the_pretty_thing_that_lives_in_the_house," It's commendable that Perkins seems wholly uninterested in the tropes of the genre: there's only one jump scare, hardly any gore and no final girl. The elusiveness of the narrative, however, grows weary fast."
m/i_am_thor," Jon Mikl Thor is a showman and a stalwart, a flat-out legend, and I AM THOR is the often uproarious, and sometimes quite poignant, love letter he deserves."
m/i_am_trying_to_break_your_heart, Fans of the band will know that the album was eventually released by Nonesuch and became a success. Yet Mr. Jones manages to generate some authentic dramatic tension and suspense.
m/i_am_vengeance_retaliation, Stu Bennett (aka Wade Barrett) returns in a formulaic action-adventure sequel that plays like a replay of '80s-era direct-to-video fare.
m/i_am_woman," This pedestrian biopic doesn't really convey the distinctiveness of Reddy's appeal, let alone package it in a way likely to trigger a significant revival of interest in a major star largely forgotten now."
m/i_can_do_bad_all_by_myself," Perry plugs into the primal power of gospel, blues, soul, and the black church in ways that make Bad far more affecting than it has any right to be."
m/i_can_only_imagine_2018," Like so many faith-based efforts, I Can Only Imagine suffers from a terminal case of self-importance."
m/i_can_see_you," The sensory disorientation climaxes in a freakout that wipes all your troubles away, as well as anything else lying around in your head."
m/i_capture_the_castle, A classy adaptation of the much-loved Dodie Smith classic.
m/i_come_in_peace," It's B-movie stuff, but as long as an alien sucks your brain out first, you'll enjoy it."
m/i_confess, The biggest crime surrounding I Confess is the generally indifferent reception that the film has received over the years
m/i_daniel_blake," Despite its flaws and predictability, it's hard not to be won over by the warmth of its human spirit, as it confronts a subject that sadly remains just as relevant as ever."
m/i_declare_war_2012," This is deadpan humour that stretches out one good joke, where not so innocent kids pass the time between strategic kills discussing schoolyard politics - or maybe grabbing a juice."
m/i_do_2012, Director Glenn Gaylord and director of photography David Morris Gil (shooting his first feature) give the film a nicely autumnal New York.
m/i_dont_feel_at_home_in_this_world_anymore, It's charmingly bizarre and it's a joy to watch Lynskey and Wood at work.
m/i_dont_know_how_she_does_it," I Don't Know How She Does It is a clich-ridden, misogynistic mess."
m/i_dreamed_of_africa," When the characters' minds and motivations are frustratingly closed off to us, all we're left with is the dim hope that something adventurous will happen instead. And when it doesn't, there's no hope left at all."
m/i_feel_pretty_2018," As sweet as ""I Feel Pretty"" often is, it's also at times depressing."
m/i_frankenstein," Mary Shelley, this is not. ""I, Frankenstein"" is a bland mess of a film with nothing going on upstairs and not a thing to separate it from the wave of dreary, likeminded sci-fi/action exercises."
m/i_give_it_a_year," Even if the emotional mathematics don't quite add up, enough diversion is provided by pic's broader comic setpieces to paper over the cracks."
m/i_got_the_hookup, The senseless chases and unexplained affairs and alliances ... wear on the patience of the audience.
m/i_hate_kids_2019, Not NEARLY as funny as its title -- notwithstanding the efforts of Tituss Burgess
m/i_hate_valentines_day, A plodding mediocrity with an almost mercenary adherence to formula.
m/i_have_never_forgotten_you_the_life_and_legacy_of_simon_wiesenthal, Important documentary record of an extraordinary man.
m/i_heart_huckabees," A one-of-a-kind original. Those courageous enough to give it a try will find their efforts rewarded, at times in the most unexpected of ways."
m/i_hope_they_serve_beer_in_hell, I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell is the Armageddon of gross-out sex comedies.
m/i_kill_giants," As a first-time film statement, I Kill Giants is particularly assured and remarkable."
m/i_killed_my_mother," Xavier Dolan is definitely a promising filmmaker. But his debut remains too uneven to be entirely satisfying, as far as I'm concerned."
m/i_know_what_you_did_last_summer," while any cod in the audience will undoubtedly shiver at the sight of a murderer in fisherman's garb, it looks pretty silly to us land-lubbers."
m/i_know_who_killed_me, There is no way that Lohan was in her right mind when she signed the contract for this one.
m/i_lost_my_body," It's a romance, a macabre comedy and a PTSD character study without ever feeling like a patchwork. It's a tale of someone trying to become whole again, literally and figuratively."
m/i_love_trouble," This unsnappy vehicle lets its two stars down, individually and as a team."
m/i_love_you_again," One of the duo's finest works together, a rip-snorting screwball comedy that bounces from silliness to insanity with spectacular ease."
m/i_love_you_alice_b_toklas," This first half of the film is the best, as Sellers gradually bends the middle-class into non-class."
m/i_love_you_man," A pal from hell premarital grossout kept afloat by meek makeover man Rudd and brazenly wacko Segel. But those prenuptial same sex chum assignments, public poop pooch pride, and a cozy nook filled with masturbatory chachkas, feel less bonded."
m/i_love_you_phillip_morris," Best of all, throughout this madcap yarn, Carrey's Russell is a fittingly unreliable narrator and thus pings the movie randomly through time in occasionally bewildering and ultimately exhilarating fashion."
m/i_love_you_to_death," It's a movie oddly out of touch with itself, simultaneously anarchic and flaccid. You can laugh at it, even love some of it, but just as likely, you'll slip off to a dreamy world all your own."
m/i_married_a_witch," It's short and wittily acerbic, and suggests that his confections may be worth re-assessment."
m/i_melt_with_you, It's not a matter of filmmaking incompetence. This is all on purpose. They meant to make it exactly this way.
m/i_now_pronounce_you_chuck_and_larry," The picture delivers 90 minutes of gay caricatures, along with a barrage of fat jokes, and culminates by lecturing the audience about how wrong it is to mock those who are different."
m/i_o_u_s_a," For a topic as inherently boring as economics, [director Patrick] Creadon has managed a creditable job of keeping our attention throughout I.O.U.S.A."
m/i_origins," Persuasive sci-fi tech talk, soulful romance and an earnest stab at metaphysics combine in director Mike Cahill's polished second feature."
m/i_pastafari," One of the more delicious, amusing, and relevant documentaries of the year. Thanks to Mike Arthur's deft direction, what at first seems just a Monty-Python-like fun fest actually becomes an in-depth take on religious institutions."
m/i_remember_mama," Thin, manipulative, and overlong, but frighteningly effective."
m/i_remember_me," Well edited, with an informative narration, the film is an important step toward understanding this bizarre disease."
m/i_robot," A routine Will Smith cop-on- the-hunt thriller at heart, I, Robot lacks imaginative excitement."
m/i_saw_the_light," It's always disappointing when a biopic fails to capture an artist, but I Saw The Light doesn't even capture the art."
m/i_see_you_2019," While Randall maintains tension and a palpable sense of ambiguity, his film also happens to be a bit slow and clumsy, biting off more than it can chew. It especially gets laughably convoluted towards the end, where plausibility is stretched..."
m/i_served_the_king_of_england, Story has been shrewdly yet passionately shaped for the screen.
m/i_smile_back," A grim and depressing movie that's painfully dull, making it hard to recommend it even for fans of Silverman who want to see her stretch her dramatic acting muscles."
m/i_spit_on_your_grave," A precise and damning indictment of male sexuality, perhaps the most stridently anti-masculine film ever made by a male filmmaker."
m/i_spit_on_your_grave_2," With I Spit on Your Grave 2, director Steven R. Monroe returns and reveals that everything he seemingly did right in his first remake must have been accidental, for this horrifically misguided sequel is everything you pray a movie like this would not be."
m/i_spit_on_your_grave_2010," It is a movie that digs into a heart of darkness on par with the criminal atrocities that soldiers of all stripes commit against innocent people every day. If it's tough to swallow, that's because it's supposed to be."
m/i_spy," The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story, character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together."
m/i_still_believe, This biopic of the real-life romance between the future contemporary Christian singer Jeremy Camp and the strong and good Melissa Henning is very touching.
m/i_still_know_what_you_did_last_summer, The prospect of a third installment of this derivative series is much scarier than anything that happens in the movie.
m/i_still_see_you," There's too much science, not enough fiction, in this sci-fi spook-show."
m/i_think_i_love_my_wife," There's a lot to recommend here, and it's a stepping stone to even more impressive work from Chris Rock."
m/i_think_were_alone_now_2018," ""I Think We're Alone Now"" is mostly an ambitious portrait of a man who meets another survivor that slowly beguiles feelings of hope and affection from someone who never thought he'd see another living person again."
m/i_tonya," A beautifully made pop-culture pastiche, with the best ensemble cast of the year."
m/i_trapped_the_devil," It may sound like I Trapped the Devil is an absurdist dark comedy or a boring thought exercise, but the experience of watching it makes for a tense, slow-burn horror film."
m/i_used_to_be_darker_2013," The songs performed here function as the creative end point of emotional trauma, revealing pain gradually transfigured into art."
m/i_used_to_go_here," Looking toward a future, moving past emotional shellshock, assembled with the understated, even serene confidence of an experienced filmmaker... Rey is a miniaturist who has found an apt canvas."
m/i_vitelloni," Moving from cafés to poolrooms to movie theaters, it's the prototypical male ensemble film."
m/i_walked_with_a_zombie, A miniature masterpiece of contorted human emotions and uneasy personal broodings emphasized by a gothic melange of sight and sound.
m/i_want_to_live, Director Wise is content to let Hayward take the film in her teeth from the moment she appears in the film and not let it go until she collapses in the gas chamber two hours later.
m/i_was_a_male_war_bride, Very funny star vehicle with Grant and Sheridan at their best.
m/i_was_a_teenage_zombie," Although cheap and juvenile, I Was A Teenage Zombie is amusing enough for those who enjoy the goofy films that turn up at midnight shows."
m/i_went_down," Well-acted crime drama, though the thick accents might be off-putting to some."
m/i_will_follow," The soulful, messy process of grief gets a soulful, messy treatment in Ava DuVernay's I Will Follow."
m/i_will_follow_you_into_the_dark_2012," An embarrassment for everyone involved. Pay for a ticket, and that'll include you, too."
m/i_will_make_you_mine, Chen does a great job expanding on these characters that Dave Boyle created while she spins her own creative and mature lens on them.
m/i_wish_2012," I Wish makes us feel like we are watching these kids discover each new sensory pleasure of youth for the first time, or that we're experiencing it ourselves."
m/ibiza, Stream it. You'll laugh often enough that you won't feel ripped off. But you'll also likely feel a twinge of regret at the comedy these three women could have made.
m/iboy," iBoy is a sparky film, embedded in London's cheek-by-jowl world of wealth and poverty. It's also a dark teen drama, peppered with brutal beatings, gang rape, drugs and dead bodies."
m/icarus_2017," While Icarus technically doesn't break any news, it certainly scores many points by showing a diabolical wizard so surprisingly laying his secrets on the table."
m/ice_age, Ice Age is a fun new addition to the growing list of CG Animation films.
m/ice_age_2," Ice Age: The Meltdown blithely looks on the bright side of life, amassing a screen full of vultures to sing and dance 'Food Glorious Food' and daring us not to get happy."
m/ice_age_collision_course," Sadly, 15 years in, even the domestic developments surrounding Manny and his brood have been relegated to the sidelines, displaced by too many shrill characters frantically attempting to pad the emaciated plot."
m/ice_age_continental_drift," The wit and charm of the series' earlier entries, and much of their visual splendour, appears to have evaporated."
m/ice_from_the_sun," Here and there one can detect the slightest vestiges of creative fancy peeking through the rubble of horrific brutality, gimmicky, and din."
m/ice_harvest, The film never convinces us that its main characters really belong in this seamy world.
m/ice_on_fire_2019, Should be essential viewing for anyone who plans to carry on living on the planet...
m/ice_princess," Trite but nice, this enjoyable comedy-drama has good-spirited warmth toward almost all its characters."
m/ice_station_zebra," If this had been a routine Saturday-afternoon thriller, it might have been fun. But it's been stretched out to roadshow length and loaded down with lots of gimmicks to conceal the thinness of the story."
m/ice_storm," Lee is adept at creating a vivid sense of place, using numerous establishing and tracking shots to make the wistful, forlorn atmosphere of New Canaan come alive."
m/iceberg_slim_portrait_of_a_pimp," A labor of love biodoc that nonetheless offers a warts-and-all evaluation of its subject, Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp intrigues and illuminates."
m/ichi_the_killer, Nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one.
m/ida_2013," This story of faith and despair is gracefully told, its simple, uncluttered spaces and luminous black-and-white photography harking back to Robert Bresson."
m/identity, What starts out as a seemingly-routine excursion into genre clichs emerges into a more complex and satisfying arena than most viewers will anticipate.
m/identity_thief," A cabal of under-sketched narrative interlopers, an uncertain mixture of tones and, most damningly, a general lack of good ideas and jokes doom this strained offering."
m/idiocracy, ...consistently entertaining and sporadically hilarious...
m/idiots_and_angels, I like to think Plympton would take it as a compliment if I said he sees human beings as little more than a debased sum of bodily functions.
m/idle_hands," It may not be a great movie, but it's one of the most amusing times I've had at the multiplex this whole year."
m/idlewild," While it's visually inventive, the story's too trite and clichd to be meaningful."
m/if1968," If . . . is so good and strong that even those things in the movie that strike me as being first-class mistakes are of more interest than entire movies made by smoothly consistent, lesser directors."
m/if_a_tree_falls_a_story_of_the_earth_liberation_front, A gimlet-eyed glimpse into the roots of terrorism and the politics behind its prosecution.
m/if_i_stay," [Moretz is] a rapidly rising star and the role is her first full-fledged romantic lead. But a few minutes into the drippy teen love-and-death story, you'll likely wish she hadn't."
m/if_i_want_to_whistle_i_whistle, A stilted and frustrating grab-bag of stylistic and narrative clichs propping up nothing at all in particular.
m/if_i_were_you_2012," A screwball comedy for Canadians-not LOL funny, but as crazy as you might expect Toronto to get."
m/if_lucy_fell," If Lucy Fell has all the attributes of romantic comedy, including absolute predictability. The only surprise is that it also provides a mostly-enjoyable journey to its ultimate destination."
m/if_the_dancer_dances," It's less of an insightful backstage documentary than a gushing, sycophantic love letter to the late Merce Cunningham."
m/if_you_build_it, That one comes away with so many questions speaks to the film's inspirational quality.
m/if_you_dont_i_will, The on-screen relationship is dead upon the first scene. There's no else to go but to divorce court.
m/igby_goes_down, Unusually well-grounded in terms of its offbeat characters and ironic situations.
m/ikiru," Confronts life and death without avoiding complexity, exploring ideas and emotions with subtlety and compassion."
m/il_divo," Witty, playful, poignant, and boasting a charismatic turn from Servillo, Sorrentino's chronicle of notorious Italian politico Andreotti is deservedly a highlight of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival; it's time to release all of Sorrentino's work in the U.S."
m/il_futuro_2013," A counterproductively ""literary"" film with no satisfying payoffs, Rutger Hauer's blind recluse notwithstanding."
m/ill_always_know_what_you_did_last_summer, This one will not hook any but the most desperate of horror fans.
m/ill_be_there," This movie is a light romp and a little different from your typical romantic comedy, because most of the relationship building is between the father and daughter."
m/ill_do_anything," It is helpful, I think, to simply forget about the missing songs, and recognize that I'll Do Anything is a complete movie without them -- smart, original, subversive."
m/ill_follow_you_down," Writer-director Richie Mehta's characters aren't especially thoughtful. Like their creator, they make massive leaps in logic before they do anything."
m/ill_see_you_in_my_dreams," This is the mercurial nature of cinema. With good casting, decent writing and a light directorial touch where others might go for full-frontal schmaltz, almost any scenario can win you over."
m/ill_see_you_in_my_dreams_1951," This story, as enacted by Mr. Danny Thomas and Miss Doris Day, is remarkable for its similarity to the life-histories of all the lyric-writers who have ever lived."
m/ill_sleep_when_im_dead, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead may take its place with Get Carter as a classic British gangster film.
m/ill_take_your_dead," The life-like thriller, eccentric comedy, and outlandish horror elements don't quite gel as well as intended, clumsily getting in each other's way."
m/illegal_2011," Blunt, loud, and showboaty, Illegal suffers even more when compared with another recent Lige-set film about the horrors faced by paperless immigrants: the Dardennes' Lorna's Silence."
m/illegal_tender," Pic is too muted to have much lasting impact, and remains modestly diverting only on a scene-to-scene basis."
m/illtown, A rare--almost subversive--cinematic treatise on the modern gangsta genre
m/illuminata," Those who share the movie's love of acting will find much to enjoy, though mainly in discrete tableaux."
m/illusionist," It's a marginal story, and passionless in the way it's been antiseptically brought to the screen, but it's not unenjoyable."
m/illustrated_man, Interesting if not totally successful adaptation of Bradbury's stories.
m/ilo_ilo," ""Nice"" film about new Filipina nanny in Singapore deeper than it looks"
m/ils_se_marierent_et_eurent_beaucoup_denfants_2005," There's little you haven't seen in any number of French flicks, but then, most of them didn't have Gainsbourg."
m/ilya_and_emilia_kabakov_enter_here," There's a lot of material here to get through, and Wallach and her cinematographer Ken Kobland take their time with it, a gamble of an approach which works, on the whole."
m/im_all_right_jack," It combines social satire with knockabout farce, not always successfully, but at least both are there and both are done crisply and with wit."
m/im_gonna_git_you_sucka, Wayans' choosing to play romantic lead seems more narcissistic than smartly comic (watch him unleash those built biceps once too often); he lacks an unidentifiable shtick.
m/im_in_love_with_a_church_girl, A message film with the narrative sophistication of a recruiting pamphlet.
m/im_not_ashamed, Ultimately it's just another vehicle for a series of scenes in which devout characters remind each other that God has it all under control.
m/im_not_there_suppositions_on_a_film_concerning_dylan," A beautifully shot, brilliantly acted incoherent mess, ranking up there with David Lynch's Inland Empire as one of the most inscrutable films of the year."
m/im_so_excited," It's as camp as Christmas and light as a feather, but there's fun to be had in this absurdist comedy in the clouds."
m/im_still_here_2010," This film gives us more access than the most inquisitive tabloid magazines into Phoenix's world. By doing so, it makes us question and even become a little ashamed about our own voyeurism."
m/im_through_with_white_girls, A broad comedy that occasionally suffers for its leads' lack of comic chemistry...it takes the film a while to work through the stereotypes it traffics in before it can critique them.
m/images," It is a rare film that can entice me to surrender my logic, but Images does just that. [It] is a film in which Altman doesn't worry about defenses. He boldly creates a spiritual vision and lets logic and caution fall by the wayside of wondrous beauty."
m/imaginary_crimes," Keitel manages to endow this compulsive liar with a degree of tenderness. And the film, unusually literate and textured for today's Hollywood, presents him as an emblem for an uptight, self-deceiving era."
m/imaginary_order," Admirably acted and powered by a loopy internal rhythm, the film nonetheless wears out its welcome long before it's done inflicting indignities on its heroine, arriving at its main point early and then repeating it again and again."
m/imagine," The result is the portrait of a man who was complex, sometimes confused, not always very happy, but a great artist all the same."
m/imagine_me_and_you, ...this is the sort of movie that's almost impossible to all-out dislike (provided one approaches it with the appropriate mindset).
m/imagining_argentina," Hampton makes a moving job of it, with top-notch cinematography and heartfelt performances."
m/imitation_girl," Beautifully filmed, thoughtful and dreamlike, Imitation Girl is an impressive piece of work."
m/immaculate_conception_of_little_dizzle," Looking as if it were devised on acid and executed on mushrooms, this imaginative debut feature from the Seattle artist and filmmaker David Russo finds meaning in cleaning and life in dead ends."
m/immediate_family, Lovely performances elevate this predictable drama.
m/immigration_tango," A sprightly, pedestrian, Miami-set romantic comedy whose utter predictability -- trumpet fanfares couldn't announce plot twists more blatantly -- feels more cozy than disappointing."
m/immoral_tales," In Paloma Picasso, sex reaches the exquisite category of a rigorously calculated pleasure, a studied rehabilitation of love. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/immortal_2020," ""Immortal"" is inventive and engaging, with more emotionality and surprise than similar offerings."
m/immortal_beloved," It is, in the end, no more than a nice, fluffy, heavily romanticized stab at an already disputed history."
m/immortals_2011, Few directors offer such a geometric mise en scene.
m/imperial_dreams," Imperial Dreams details the morally ambivalence of the situation in inner-city LA with beauty and grace, providing some of the most effective and memorable performances of the year."
m/imperium, It demonstrates both the fatal proximity and deceptive distance that can exist between the words and deeds of extremists.
m/importance_of_being_earnest," Where Husband was light on its feet and congenial, Earnest never gets off the ground."
m/impossible_monsters," Stylish and atmospheric, but undercooked and underwhelming."
m/impostor, Feels like one of those sci-fi TV shows that you watch for an hour and then forget all about.
m/impractical_jokers_the_movie," I'm glad the jokers had fun, but what about the rest of us?"
m/imprisoned_2019," Although certainly well-meaning in its condemnation of capital punishment, Imprisoned is too dully executed to achieve its desired impact."
m/impromptu," Most of the hearty laughs are packed into the first half, but the more focused second part maintains interest as it cannily explores the topic of role reversals."
m/in-the-name-of-the-king-a-dungeon-siege-tale," A major piece of crap. It shamelessly steals from J.R.R. Tolkien/Peter Jackson, but with none of the intelligence, heart and artistry."
m/in_a_better_world," A well-told parable about on the futile perpetuation of violence ... [Director Susanne] Bier may not believe in hitting back, but she's a big believer in hitting hard."
m/in_a_lonely_place," Ray wrings plenty of sweat from the Hitchcockian premise, and Bogart outdoes himself as a man mid-breakdown."
m/in_a_relationship," It's difficult to imagine that a rom-com about twenty somethings in LA could bring anything new to the table, but In a Relationship is just charming and funny enough to avoid problematic narratives or clichés."
m/in_a_valley_of_violence," West's grasp of the rhythms and the grace notes of the Western idiom is undeniable, but he never seems to find a film worth telling within it."
m/in_a_world_2013," A delightful comedy that goes a long way on the strength of its very likeable cast, In A World... isn't uproariously funny, but its steady stream of chuckles and ingratiating tone leave a very warm afterglow."
m/in_america," This is Francis Coppola level filmmaking... It is driven by that rarest of commodities in America film today... real, unabashed, unashamed emotion."
m/in_and_out, One coming-out party that aims to please nearly everyone.
m/in_another_country," An arty, though not particularly artful, experiment"
m/in_between_days," Above all a meditation on loneliness, the narrative is frequently interrupted by static landscape shots accompanied by Aimie reading letters to her absent dad -- stabs at poetry that feel less poetic, and more calculated, with every recurrence."
m/in_bruges," Not a comedy for everyone, but definitely a comedy for some, especially those who enjoy dark, un-politically correct comedy and who don't mind a bit of blood and violence amongst the laughs."
m/in_country, A profoundly moving tearjerker about the festering wounds caused by the Vietnam War in middle America. A young Emily Lloyd is absolutely wonderful.
m/in_darkness_2011, A harrowing story of a Polish Catholic who develops empathy for the Jews he saved during WWII.
m/in_darkness_2018," This thriller starts well and has worthy elements -- especially a strong female character, co-created by Dormer herself -- but the plot eventually becomes needlessly stretched-out and convoluted."
m/in_dreams, For all the movie's extravagances--and it must be admitted that Darius Khondji's cinematography is gloriously extravagant--it just isn't all that frightening.
m/in_dubious_battle, Impressive Steinbeck adaptation let down a bit by the younger leads.
m/in_fabric, The overall exercise is so captivating - despite its taxingly slow pace - that audiences naturally reorient themselves to see where Strickland will take them next.
m/in_fear_2013, In Fear is very much a must-see movie of the year for fans of the genre.
m/in_good_company," Weitz provides juicy roles for Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson and manages to edge into areas in our society mostly unexplored in mainstream American films."
m/in_harms_way," It goes on and on, the slowness exacerbated by Preminger's customary long takes and by the endless parade of star cameos."
m/in_her_shoes," You'll probably need a tissue or two, but the film earns every sniffle due to its sharply astute writing, directing and acting."
m/in_like_flint," A clumsy, bland and far too subtle satire of the spy genre."
m/in_my_country, A sludgy quagmire of sanctimonious moralizing and overbearing melodrama.
m/in_my_fathers_house," In My Father's House doesn't spend much time on politics, examining why rates of fatherlessness are so high among black American families, but it doesn't need to."
m/in_my_sleep," The biggest problem with Allen Wolf's thriller is that there are so few characters, it's immediately clear what's going on; there's simply no one to suspect besides the obvious."
m/in_old_arizona," The first major Western in sound...One can occasionally feel the filmmakers showing off the technology, with close-ups of a crying baby or sizzling ham and eggs. [Blu-ray]"
m/in_old_chicago," Like San Francisco, events sort of just happen and allegiances just sort of shift around to stall time before the grand finale."
m/in_our_nature, Savelson's approach feels old-fashioned and perhaps even a little stodgy.
m/in_search_of_beethoven," If the interminable length of In Search of Beethoven doesn't put people off this repetitive documentary about ""the world's greatest composer"", then the lack of real insight into the man rather than the myth surely will."
m/in_search_of_blind_joe_death_the_saga_of_john_fahey, Fahey-who died in 2001 at age 61-is depicted as a unique explorer who was in constant search of his next sonic revelation.
m/in_search_of_chopin, [Feels] at times like a infomercial for a greatest-hits album.
m/in_search_of_greatness," Obviously, sports fans will get the most out of ""In Search of Greatness."" But there are self-help tropes for everyone."
m/in_search_of_haydn, Is the best way to bring audiences to this fantastic music to make them feel like they're back at school?
m/in_search_of_memory," No negatives can detract from the warm, inviting, slightly-yellowed smile of this survivor and optimist with more to teach us than just neuroscience."
m/in_search_of_mozart," Setting the record straight literally and figuratively, In Search of Mozart is an adamantly linear, myth-busting stride through a prodigiously talented life."
m/in_secret," A broad, crude mutilation of Emile Zola's noirish romance Thrse Raquin that prioritizes heavy petting over plot."
m/in_the_aisles," A lyrical portrait of emotionally damaged misfits sharing a soulless working environment in contemporary East Germany, In the Aisles is full of tender observation and humane empathy for its downtrodden protagonists."
m/in_the_army_now," Every promising situation -- Shore suffering through basic training, dealing with real battle and so on -- suffers immediate creative fatigue."
m/in_the_bedroom, Field's leisurely buildup forestalls but doesn't prevent his movie's mutation into a granola Death Wish.
m/in_the_blood_2013, It's a tense and exciting action thriller I was very much invested in until the very end...
m/in_the_company_of_men," This is a fully realized movie, whose intelligence -- despite its grim findings -- dwarfs any Hollywood production. It's a film to admire -- even if it leaves you cold."
m/in_the_courtyard, Salvadori explores themes and layers of the genre that are very uncommon. [Full review in Spanish]
m/in_the_cut," Derivative, idiotic thriller that is devoid of any suspense, logic or intelligence."
m/in_the_electric_mist, There are too many subplots going on to make it work other than as a mildly intriguing curiosity.
m/in_the_fade," Doggedly conventional in its approach, the film walks an uneasy line between unflinching honesty and crass emotional exploitation, before tipping into the latter in a questionable final act."
m/in_the_family_2011," Mr. Wang's slow-reveal psychological drama isn't just a showcase for his excellent ensemble cast. Beautifully modulated and stylistically sui generis, ""In the Family"" is also one of the most accomplished and undersold directorial debuts this year."
m/in_the_heart_of_the_sea," A pedestrian retelling of a harrowing real-life survival story that served as one of the key inspirations for ""Moby-Dick."""
m/in_the_heat_of_the_night," ...a thoughtful moral drama, an absorbing character study, an enjoyable comedy, and a mystery thriller all rolled into one."
m/in_the_intense_now, The movie is unique in its ability to put the viewer inside of the mind-frame of an explosive time that seemed so far away-until today.
m/in_the_land_of_blood_and_honey," Not a celebrity vanity project, but an astute, dramatically gripping, deeply feminist work. Despite some script problems, the film is a surprising triumph in so many ways."
m/in_the_land_of_women," it is amazing to discover just how much this absorbing, intelligent picture has going for it: a strong sense of time and place, interesting characters, painfully sincere direction and an intriguing scenario that pauses and breathes in all the right places"
m/in_the_line_of_fire," While strong performances by John Malkovich and Eastwood make this an engaging movie to watch, director Wolfgang Petersen too often substitutes gratuitous violence for suspense, enigma for narrative and cliches about loneliness for character development."
m/in_the_loop," Spinal Tap meets Strangelove. A satirical demolition of Whitehall and Washington: politically astute, hilarious and terrifyingly real."
m/in_the_mirror_of_maya_deren," Not only celebrates Deren's cinematic legacy but also reveals a gifted talent whose explosive temperament was at odds with the lyrical, dreamlike imagery she put on screen."
m/in_the_mix," Mix, however, never once veers from its main mission. That would be superstar as product placement."
m/in_the_mouth_of_madness, Limp performances and ludicrous special effects remove this study of reality from any sense of it.
m/in_the_name_of_my_daughter, A French thriller revolving around the theme of betrayal by those you trust
m/in_the_name_of_the_father," It's powerful, and Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is scalding."
m/in_the_pit, Formally elegant depiction of lives of ordinary workers involved with mammoth construction project.
m/in_the_realm_of_the_senses," The majority of what we are made to watch is far from enlightening, entertaining, or erotic."
m/in_the_shadow_of_the_moon," Absolutely awe-inspiring, it manages to be almost as naturally funny as it is uplifting. It offers viewers a nearly perfect 'you are there' experience."
m/in_the_shadow_of_the_moon_2019," It's certainly an imaginative concept for a detective story, but the storyline gets so convoluted and baroque that unintentional humor sets in."
m/in_the_tall_grass_2019," The closest recent parallel I can draw is between this and ""A Quiet Place."" Both movies prove that what we don't see (or hear) can conjure up an entirely different form of dread than you might expect."
m/in_the_valley_of_elah," Haggis, with an exemplary cast, explores shadowy secrets of men in the ranks with a determined brush, tipped with heart-piercing irony."
m/in_their_skin, The most frustrating thing about Jeremy Power Regimbal's directorial debut is there's part of a very effective thriller here. It's just not the good part.
m/in_time, Falls apart whenever there's a lull in the action and you start to think about how it all fits together.
m/in_un_altro_paese," Marco Turco's film is a thorough, journalistic examination that is ultimately as horrifying as it is informative."
m/in_which_we_serve," Perhaps the most honored propaganda film of World War II, in which the survivors of a torpedoed British battleship recall their reasons for fighting through individual flashbacks."
m/in_your_eyes_2012," It almost seems like a failed TV pilot where they were planning to tell some really cool stories in the first season, but they never ended up writing those episodes."
m/inappropriate_comedy," An inept, brutally unfunny collection of sketches ..."
m/inbred," It is, alas, stuck down the very same 'dirty hole' of the British horror market where the likes of Lesbian Vampire Killers and Evil Aliens reside, desperate to pump their captive audience full of all the shit it can take and more."
m/incarnate_2016," Offers a relatively fresh take on standard-issue exorcism-melodrama tropes, along with a performance by Aaron Eckhart that is more than persuasive enough to encourage the investment of a rooting interest."
m/incendiary, The movie plunges straight down that treacherous black hole that exists between fact and fiction and the inability to replicate either.
m/incendies," A sensible switch from stage to screen, but lovers of the original may be disappointed"
m/inception," A devilishly complicated, fiendishly enjoyable sci-fi voyage across a dreamscape that is thoroughly compelling."
m/inchallah_2012," This film has a lot to say, and it's sometimes affecting, but most of the time feels too understated to really deliver the powerful effect it seems to be going for."
m/incident-at-oglala," Incident at Oglala is about his specific case, but in a sense it is about a larger subject, about the continuing insult of a federal government which treats and regards Native Americans in a paternalistic, repressive style."
m/incident_at_loch_ness," Razor sharp and funny as hell, Incident at Loch Ness is the harpoon hurled into the hot-air balloon of 'reality' entertainment."
m/incident_in_a_ghost_land_2018," Although this film by the French director, Pascal Laugier, takes on the conventions of the film genre, it also proposes a different reading, influenced by the current of the new French extremism. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/inconceivable_2017," It's bland, and the more helmer Jonathan Baker trusts in the dramatic limitations of the effort, the harder it is to sit through the movie."
m/inconvenient_truth," What one comes away with hoping for the future is that we do not look back on Al Gore as we look back now on Eisenhower (""Why We Fight"") or Edward R. Murrow (""Good Night, and Good Luck"") - as a man who gave a warning unheeded."
m/incredible_shrinking_man," The special effects and trick photography are cleverly done (for its time). Also, the story is intelligently handled."
m/incredibles," The ""comics"" of the 21st century--in the fullest sense of the term. If you don't love it I've got a nice flat for you on Mars. Meanwhile, there's a new bonanza on the block."
m/incredibles_2," Incredibles 2 feels a bit late to the game, but will still delight audiences in the themes and family togetherness it promotes."
m/indecent_proposal," It is artificial and manipulative, and in the real world this sort of thing would never happen in this way, but then that's why we line up at the ticket window: We want to leave the real world, for a couple of hours, anyway."
m/independence_day_resurgence," In trying to recapture the sheer entertainment value of the first movie, Independence Day: Resurgence forgot it was making a movie for modern audiences, relying on the kind of bad dialogue and plot contrivances better left in the 20th century."
m/indian_in_the_cupboard," The 98 minute drama takes good advantage of the premise, however, to provide some simple intelligent lessons about tolerance. cultural diversity and the nature of life, utilizing the magic of filmmaking to ignite the imagination and stir some excitement,"
m/indiana_jones_and_the_kingdom_of_the_crystal_skull, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull can't be seen as anything other than a very minor chapter in the adventures of one of cinema's most beloved action heroes and a disappointment for those who have waited patiently for his return.
m/indiana_jones_and_the_last_crusade, A brilliant coup sees the film kick off with an extended flashback to Indiana's early days and our young hero (Phoenix) having his first taste of adventure during a scout trip in Utah.
m/indiana_jones_and_the_temple_of_doom, There's plenty of rip-roaring action to distract us from the more unpalatable elements.
m/indie_game_the_movie_2012, My favorite film of SXSW and would have been my favorite film at Sundance if I'd seen it there this year... the story of an artist making something and what it costs personally and professionally.
m/indignation," You can keep your 3D and blue screen. For my money, the most exciting scene of the summer comes as Logan Lerman and Tracy Letts let it rip in this Philip Roth adaptation."
m/indiscretion_of_an_american_wife, I'd be hard-pressed to name two actors with less obvious chemistry together.
m/indivisible_2018, Homecoming from war treated as more than merely tying a yellow ribbon around an old oak tree and leaving the rest to Jesus.
m/inequality_for_all_2013," The woods are full of ""Outrage Docs,"" but this one is special."
m/inescapable_2012," The film is shaped as a political thriller, but the emotion of a desperate father looking for his child makes Inescapable accessible; the stakes are personal."
m/infamous, Infamous is a film about flashy facades and what lies beneath them.
m/infamous_2020," Bella Thorn and company try to imagine if ""Bonnie and Clyde"" had been social media influencers in ""Infamous"" and it's exactly as terrible as it sounds."
m/infancia_clandestina," As is often the case with directors who adapt their own life-histories, there's the sense that Avila is a little too close to his material."
m/infernal_affairs, It's refreshing enough to make up for its occasional missteps in the storytelling department.
m/infernal_affairs_2, More than worthy companion to its powerhouse predecessor.
m/inferno_2016," Having already taken two rides on the Dan Brown merry-go-round, shouldn't this have been the one where Ron finally got it right?"
m/infini_2015," Script and storytelling shortcomings aside, it is the overarching familiarity of Abbess' visual cues that derails his ambition."
m/infinitely_polar_bear," Could be subtitled ""the lighter side of manic depression"". Ruffalo is terrific, and the film is ultimately great family entertainment."
m/informant_2013," Gripping documentary about a snitch responsible for two young men being entrapped by the FBI. In a period where federal agencies are breaking crimes left and right, a most topical offering."
m/inglourious_basterds," It's a film that's only interested in film, a masterclass in gorgeously-constructed self-pastiche. Tarantino desperately needs an editor willing to trim his indulgences."
m/ingrid_goes_west," One of those weird, creepy, unsettling films about obsessions that you just can't help but become a little bit obsessed about yourself."
m/inhale," This is not the feel good movie of the year, but it certainly is a potent flick that will have you thinking."
m/inherent_vice," a hilariously complex stoner noir that weaves around its massive web of characters utilizing a tone that's at times overtly slapstick, yet also deeply spiritual and romantic."
m/inherit_the_viper, A run of the mill crime drama that does the genre well and also features Josh Hartnett.
m/initial_d_2005," The racing scenes are well done; unfortunately, they're too often interrupted by a clich-filled story about one-note characters."
m/inkheart, The film's message that books are the doorway to learning and adventure is not overplayed even if the pic cheats a bit at the end for a tidy denouement.
m/inlaws, There are too many other good films to go see instead of this masterpiece of mediocrity.
m/inmate_1_the_rise_of_danny_trejo," [Director Brett] Harvey's documentary minces no words and gives no quarter as audiences are invited in by Trejo, his family, and his friends, to discuss a life lived on borrowed time."
m/inner_demons, ...really sticks the landing with a finale you'll remember.
m/innerspace," It's an easy-to-get-along-with movie -- bouncy, rabbity fun."
m/innocence_2014," Pretty, and dull. More promising as a romance than as anything horrific."
m/innocent_blood," It lacks the bite (so to speak) of the classics in this genre, but is a stylish blend of cool black comedy and obvious gore."
m/inserts, Inserts is a worthwhile film and does not deserve to be X'd off your list.
m/insiang_2007, Lino Brocka's portrait of familial treachery and societal abandonment channels its melodrama through the filter of neorealism.
m/inside_2007," ... a film that had tremendous potential to be much more than it is, but that potential is squandered in a welter of self-defeating carnage."
m/inside_2018, Nightmare of mother against mother that you can see with your children. [Full review in Spanish]
m/inside_daisy_clover," Wood's movements are spasmodic and graceless. The director Robert Mulligan can't quite find the rhythm, either. Some of the picture is whimsical, some of it as lugubrious as a horror movie."
m/inside_deep_throat," Tracking down everyone possible involved in making the film, a raft of intellectual commentators and key participants in the lengthy legal battles, the filmmakers successfully place Deep Throat in the context of its time."
m/inside_game," It's serviceable but generic, going through the motions of a typical crime movie without coming up with much that's distinctive. And the one genuinely novel aspect of the story - a dirty NBA referee - is squandered."
m/inside_job_2010," Compelling, infuriating and comprehensive...the best kind of lecture, explaining complex ideas with clarity and skill."
m/inside_lehman_brothers, Inside Lehman Brothers is highly relevant for a world still awakening to #MeToo. It also walks viewers through the invisible machinations that led to the subprime mortgage crisis...
m/inside_llewyn_davis_2013, To call Inside Llewyn Davis a minor work doesn't render it any less a pleasure to watch; it's to admit that the film's melancholy depiction of the '60s folk scene in Greenwich Village (and beyond) may only improve in the interim.
m/inside_man," Until Inside Man, it didn't seem possible Spike Lee could make a dull film."
m/inside_out_2015," Call Inside Out a comeback, a return to form, a gratifying reminder that no one else would attempt to make a children's tentpole movie about how emotional pain is just as essential a part of life as happiness."
m/inside_out_an_imax_3d_experience," Shooting for stoic, Mr. Levesque only delivers inert. And the plot devolves into a tangle of dithering story lines."
m/inside_the_rain," Inside the Rain can't help but be a brave piece of filmmaking. But you might not expect it to be as funny as it is. And above all, you may well be caught off-guard by its frequent moments of visual beauty."
m/insider," When Crowe gets to command the screen, The Insider comes to roiled life."
m/insidious," Less film than funhouse ride, but it's a frequently scary funhouse ride that presents itself as such."
m/insidious_chapter_2, An accomplished follow-up that doesn't feel like some lazy studio financier-instigated cash-in.
m/insidious_chapter_3_2015," The result is a warm-hearted frightening, about love and loss and, yes, next chapters."
m/insidious_the_last_key," Sporting an emotional connection and narratively complexity that's new to the franchise, Insidious: The Last Key is entertaining and effective."
m/insomnia_1998," ... a paranoid noir thriller in broad daylight, and Skarsgard inhabits his role so naturally that when he starts going off the rails, it's as disorienting as it is disturbing."
m/inspector_gadget, Broderick's natural sense of humor adds a twist to Gadget.
m/inspector_gadget_2," ...clearly aimed at six-to-ten year olds, who will miss most of the film's in-jokes. But the in-jokes are not funny, anyway, so it's no great loss."
m/inspector_general, Sharper cutting could have made it a delight; it's still passable entertainment.
m/instant_family," While Instant Family doesn't totally break the conventions of the family comedy, it uses them to its advantage."
m/instinct_de_mort, Director Jean-François Richet (Assault on Precinct 13) is proof that Luc Besson is not the only French filmmaker taking his cues from an American playbook.
m/insurgent," ""I know this doesn't make any sense,"" breathes Tris Prior during Insurgent's flamboyantly muddled finale, ""but you have to trust me."" You could hardly ask for a more honest line of dialogue than that."
m/intacto," In this much-ado-about-nothing procedural, Fresnadillo reduces his characters to pawns lost in a Greek labyrinth."
m/intermission, Thoroughly engaging multi-strand ensemble comedy that looks at the resilience required to get through everyday life.
m/internal_affairs," Figgis never lets the pace slow long enough to expose the story's thinness despite, in retrospect, a moderate amount of action."
m/international," Tom Tykwer's glossy, high finance conspiracy thriller is a spectacular looking film with an unsettling intensity."
m/international_falls," The alternately funny and poignant character-revealing dialogue flows naturally in the expert hands of Harris and Huebel, who leaven their comedic performances with strong layers of pathos."
m/interpreter, Offers something more meaty and topical than the pulling power of its glittering parts
m/intersection," Intersection pretends to be a movie of grown-up, middle-aged concerns, but it plays like a rather dull and pointless soap opera."
m/interstellar_2014," Reaffirms Nolan as the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place alongside ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""2001,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Gravity"" in the canon of Hollywood's visionary sci-fi head trips."
m/interview_with_the_assassin, The film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots.
m/interview_with_the_vampire," My complaint about the film is that not very much happens, in the plot sense."
m/intimate_enemies_2007," Truly unforgettable and revelatory, L'Ennemi intime presents a rare glimpse into the realities of war in all its gory detail, tempered with a heartbreaking insight into our inescapably frail human consciousness."
m/intimate_stories," Contrasting the epic Patagonian landscapes with the modesty of his characters' aspirations, Sorin has crafted an appealing portrait of this remote region."
m/intimate_strangers_2003," The journey really is the reward. ... A fascinating film with an intriguing little mystery at its core, it is never clear where it is headed."
m/into_great_silence," Though there are dozens of images here that you might want as a computer-screen saver, Into Great Silence does not add up to a valuable or engrossing documentary."
m/into_temptation," Sharply constructed with a heavy spray of noirish aroma, Temptation is a uniquely accomplished indie film, wielding salacious material sensitively, building an intoxicating sense of intrigue and discomfort."
m/into_the_abyss_2011, You come out shaken by the fathomless destructiveness of idiocy and the healing powers of belief and remediation.
m/into_the_arms_of_strangers_stories_of_the_kindertransport, Students of both the dark and bright side of human nature cannot afford to miss it.
m/into_the_ashes," Rather a slog...musters a grubby atmosphere but is otherwise a completely routine revenge tale, not unlike many that have come before."
m/into_the_blue," Undeniably exciting and much better than a movie with this many young, buff bodies should be."
m/into_the_forest," Connecting the incidents in Hegland's book gives Into the Forest plenty of dramatic kick, but the film leaves the impression that the characters' full selves remain stubbornly on the page, as thoughts not translated into action."
m/into_the_inferno," Herzog has always shown a gift for immersing us in the startling extremes of the natural world, and his images here do not disappoint."
m/into_the_night," Maybe what the movie needed was more professional discipline and less geniality. As a rule, it's probably better to throw the party after the filming is finished."
m/into_the_storm_2014," ...delivering the goods without turning into a kill-by-kill horror flick...it's entertaining, it works, and it doesn't pull any punches."
m/into_the_white_2012," Their little world in the wooden hut they find eventually becomes a microcosm of the real one, where they can leave behind some of the sillier prejudices of war."
m/into_the_wild," While the material seems to warrant understated, direct storytelling...Penn opts for epic proportions and clutters his narrative with gimmicks."
m/into_the_woods_2014," It's all vigorous fun, a wonderful, wintry entertainment, but its branches catch at your heart."
m/intolerable_cruelty," A broad farce that is long on manic, cartoonish behavior and short on intelligence and wit."
m/intrigo_dear_agnes," Through flashbacks, the film traces the falling out that led to the women's current iciness. Their own connections, revealed bit by bit, make their plan even more ludicrous."
m/intrigo_death_of_an_author, A narrative puzzle that proves tiresome in the solving.
m/introducing_the_dwights," Anchored by a strong performance by Brenda Blethyn as the loud, crass club entertainer angry at the world for having robbed her of her fame and success, Cherie Nowlan's down-to-earth comedic drama and coming of age story is funny and poignant"
m/intruder-2000," Confusing as hell. At one point, I was convinced the projectionist was showing the reels out of order."
m/intruder_2016, It's amazing how Intruder's ending can ruin ninety minutes worth of buildup material in three seconds.It's amazing how Intruder's ending can ruin ninety minutes worth of buildup material in three seconds.
m/intruders_2011, What begins as a masterfully crafted creature feature ultimately falls flat on its face knocking out all of its teeth.
m/intruders_2016," Intruders ultimately comes across like basic-cable schlock (or is it Netflix schlock now?), slightly redeemed by the germ of a great idea, even if said idea never truly germinates."
m/invader_zim_enter_the_florpus," It would've been depressing for these characters to go through a lazy rehash of past adventures, so I'm far happier that Vasquez took this opportunity to evolve Invader Zim."
m/invasion," ...buried deep within this mess, there are signs of a good movie struggling to get out...But, when all is said and done, the good aspects just go to show how bad this film was gutted."
m/invasion_planet_earth," This is no-budget, no-clue and no-chance film-making."
m/inventing_the_abbotts," It is rare to find a film that treats teenagers and young adults as real people who think for themselves, and own up to their mistakes"
m/invention_of_lying, An okay film with a funny premise that offers enough laughs to excuse the weaker direction.
m/investigation_of_a_citizen_above_suspicion, The movie survives beautifully both as an elegant thriller and as a study of the twisted infantilism that shapes the fanatic heart.
m/invictus," The movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, has its corny moments, for sure, but it's also powerful, full of conviction and one of the most inspiring movies of the year."
m/invincible," [It] a real-life event and turns it into a well-made, feel-good film."
m/invisible_circus," This modest project is all about atmosphere and reflection, and, as such, it is successful."
m/invisible_essence_the_little_prince," The Little Prince is a dark allegory about humans, the ridiculous extent of our selfishness versus our capacity for good. And as Officer discovers when he takes his show on the road, children have no trouble absorbing its message."
m/io, IO isn't science fiction storytelling distilled so much as it is vaporized.
m/io_sono_li, Touching story about the tender friendship between a 60-year-old Yugoslav fisherman and an unmarried Chinese woman working in a local bar.
m/ip_man," The film's hagiographical simplicity makes the Rocky movies look profound, but this is still a spirited tale with excellent martial-arts scenes."
m/ip_man_2_legend_of_the_grandmaster, Yen's in top form and the fights and stunts throughout are stellar.
m/ip_man_3," Typically nippy fight choreography by Yuen Woo-ping adds spice, while a punch-up which begins in a lift proves a slick highlight to an otherwise uneven film."
m/ip_man_4_the_finale, The film is overstuffed with characters and subplots that ultimately have little to do with Ip Man and his legacy.
m/ip_man_the_final_fight," The action choreography eschews the slow-motion, wire-assisted grace of Yuen Woo Ping's in ""The Grandmaster,"" but does a solid job of crisply and clearly showcasing a few epic brawls."
m/iq," I.Q. is a romantic comedy with its heart in the right place, and all of the other pieces distributed correctly, too."
m/ira_and_abby, A deeply funny follow-up to Kissing Jessica Stein from that film's co-writer and co-star Westfeldt.
m/iraq_for_sale_the_war_profiteers," Companheiro temtico do excelente Shadow Company, o filme expe de forma articulada a ganncia pavorosa das grandes corporaes, que no hesitam em sacrificar vidas e roubar o povo norte-americano com a cumplicidade do prprio governo."
m/iraq_in_fragments, Much of what is captured will be familiar for viewers of Frontline or other recent documentaries.
m/irene_in_time," There's some sharply written dialogue, and a few strong performances in supporting roles. But much of the action onscreen doesn't ring true."
m/iris_2015," Iris isn't groundbreaking doc filmmaking, but it's amiable and jovial in a way rarely seen in the field, which tends more toward drama, trauma, and forwarding big causes."
m/irma_la_douce, The movie was filmed on a 360-degree set so shooting could be done in any direction.
m/iron_giant," This is the film that invigorates you, makes you laugh, makes you cry and makes you happy to be alive!"
m/iron_island," Depending on one's mood, the movie might seem boldly simplified and poetic -- or boringly simpleminded and prosaic."
m/iron_man, [An] expansively entertaining special effects extravaganza.
m/iron_man_2," Not all the amped up action works...but ultimately this is Robert Downey Jr.'s gig, and he effortlessly entertains as the narcissistic, nihilistic rascal you love to envy."
m/iron_man_3," In the annals of superhero movies, this is not the most thrilling, but it does contain two Downton Abbey jokes, and a stonking performance from Downey."
m/iron_sky," Mercifully, Iron Sky is not interested in being bad, which is fortunate, because I have no interest in watching something bad."
m/ironclad," THERE comes a time in every great movie-watching experience where a special little moment in the film makes you smile with purest joy. For me, in Ironclad, it was the bit where a guy tears another guy's arm off then beats him to death with it."
m/ironclad_battle_for_blood, The director manages to deliver a commendable production on what appears to be little budget.
m/ironweed," The two leads put in startling performances to cut through [the] cynicism, but there's no levity or dramatic peak to elevate you from the misery."
m/irrational_man, Woody Allen comes out with all guns blazing on his modestly appointed but fiercely intellectual thriller Irrational Man - though the one-liners mouthed by Joaquin Phoenix's initially nihilistic philosophy professor are unusually grim.
m/irreplaceable_you, The film itself seems to be in denial about its own story.
m/irresistible_2020, Irresistible does not reflect the level of satire one would expect from from the person who hung corrupt politicians on their own words.
m/irreversible, The worst one can say about Irrversible is that it bores more than it shocks. It's essentially a 30-minute film blown out to three times that length.
m/is_paris_burning," The real star of Is Paris Burning? is the city of Paris itself. Its other performers are miscast, the film's direction is uneven, its development is confused."
m/is_that_a_gun_in_your_pocket, To call this feeble comedy a misfire would be to give it more credit than it's due.
m/is_the_man_who_is_tall_happy_an_animated_conversation_with_noam_chomsky," Oh my, look at the density and stretch of this MIT linguist!"
m/is_there_anybody_there," A combination of playful humor and gentle emotions connecting unlikely generations. Even if returning to the planet from the afterlife as a born again badger, is the elixir of choice that may shake this self-hating senior out of his miserable funk."
m/ishtar," Ishtar is an unabashed vamp for a pair of household names, and as such it works, often hilariously."
m/island_of_lemurs_madagascar," Lovingly captures lemurs in the wild, while clearly displaying how humans have become a part of this environment for better or worse."
m/isle_of_dogs_2018," In place of a satisfying whole, it is still entirely pleasurable to once again get lost in Anderson's signature wash of exquisite detail."
m/isle_of_the_dead," The film comes magnificently alive with the burial sequence, and with the zombie-like, white-robed woman roaming through shadowy galleries and shuttered rooms."
m/ismaels_ghosts," The spy story-within-a-story is moderately interesting and makes for a surprise or two, but the rest of it is utterly unbelievable."
m/isnt_it_romantic_2019," The ultimate romantic comedy for people who both love and hate rom-coms. If you love them it is a celebration of cinematic romance. If you hate them, this movie mocks the maudlin mercilessly."
m/isnt_she_great, Only funny if you enjoy going out and paying for the kind of comedy writing you can stay at home and get free on sitcoms.
m/isolation_2006," A grim, gruesome, and gloriously gross horror flick about mutated cows and the poor saps stuck on an isolated farm with the bloody bovines."
m/it-came-from-outer-space," Among top five of 1950s sci-fi classics, starring great effects along with Richard Carlson."
m/it_2016," I.T. has moments of real tension interspersed throughout, but its consistent theme -- that you can't trust technology because a bad guy might use it against you -- is a little bit silly."
m/it_2017," For a movie with so much blood, It feels disappointingly bloodless."
m/it_came_from_kuchar," Fun, frisky, ceaselessly enjoyable documentary froth."
m/it_came_from_the_desert," This isn't especially 'good', and by setting its sights no higher than to pastiche the films it's aping (as much Aliens as Them!) it falls short of being in any way meaningful."
m/it_chapter_two," While it settles into its own rhythm for the first two hours, it certainly doesn't whizz by. The casting is perfect and I enjoyed the jump scares, but overall it's not very frightening, or involving."
m/it_comes_at_night," With all of Shults' dark-night-of-the-soul mood manipulations, the film promises more than it delivers. Its buildups are impressive, but in the end its frights are mild."
m/it_felt_like_love_2013," It's easy to be seduced by the loosely observational vibe of the movie, even as its tale of a shrinking violet struggling not to be a late bloomer fails to strike more than a single note of dismay."
m/it_follows, Plays the teen horror conventions skillfully - and attractively ...
m/it_had_to_be_you_2016, This silly romantic comedy may find an audience among the 30-something crowd but will make little sense to anybody else.
m/it_happened_in_brooklyn," The film's most interesting angle: Sinatra's bloom into a carefree, light-comedy personality."
m/it_happened_in_la," Once it sheds the immediate air of imitation, L.A. Times vastly improves and even becomes charming."
m/it_happened_one_night, ...one of the smartest romantic comedies of the season. The Capra technique is evident in this story of a rich man's daughter who rebels at her father's objection to her marriage to an aviator.
m/it_lives_again," On the whole this is a good film in theory rather than practice. The script is written in the Albert Memorial style - ungainly in structure, weighed down with extraneous detail."
m/it_might_get_loud, Should cast a spell even in a tone-deaf theatrical marketplace.
m/it_runs_in_the_family, Director Fred Schepisi's painstakingly paced approach to screenwriter Jess Wigutow's already weighty material makes for a strained viewing experience.
m/it_started_as_a_joke," ""It Started As a Joke"" really makes it feel like you've been privy to something special, not only in terms of comedy, but in terms of the potential of people."
m/it_the_terror_from_beyond_space, Proudly displays all of the limitations of its bargain-basement budget.
m/italian, The Italian is not so much about present-day Russia as it is an upbeat fable of what [director Andrei] Kravchuk envisions as its future. It's a wish-fulfillment fantasy posing as hard-edged realism.
m/italian_for_beginners," Works because, for the most part, it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren."
m/italian_job," There may not be many 'wow' moments in it, but the movie rarely flags and consistently delights."
m/its-kind-of-a-funny-story, Paints a mental hospital as a charming place for a teen to come of age. Incredible that the directors of HALF-NELSON could get this so wrong.
m/its_a_disaster," The film flirts with big ideas about adult relationships, but fails to locate any gravitas about its characters' existential or psychological crises."
m/its_a_mad_mad_mad_mad_world," We just lauged and laughed -- in Cinerama, no less."
m/its_a_wonderful_life, This great American fable is buoyed by its unwavering faith in the wealth of the human spirit.
m/its_alive_iii_island_of_the_alive, Cohen continues to milk his cash cow series with some success.
m/its_all_gone_pete_tong, Whether you really dig this film will depend entirely on your affection for the club scene and you opinion of its heroes.
m/its_all_true," A short, rather unsatisfying film about Welles's misadventures in Latin America at the start of World War II."
m/its_always_fair_weather," The lively musical comedy has splendid dancing, but the story is not so splendid."
m/its_better_to_jump_2013," There are some beautiful shots of the city, but this is little more than an expertly produced home movie."
m/its_not_yet_dark_2017," Ultimately, what makes It's Not Yet Dark so remarkably powerful is the open-book honesty of its subject and those he loves."
m/its_the_great_pumpkin_charlie_brown, What the hell kind of grown-up hands out rocks on Halloween?
m/its_the_rage," ..guns take center stage as catalysts if not characters in their own right, not to mention conduits of sensuality, intimidation, foreplay and destiny."
m/itsy_bitsy_2019," The majority of computer effects throw immersion out the window (quite literally in one instance), and regardless of how hard the movie tries, it doesn't make up the lost ground by the end."
m/itzhak," Despite its many engaging moments, Itzhak will likely prove frustrating for viewers desiring more information."
m/ivan_the_terrible_part_i," Most revealing as an unintended allegory for Russian rulers' continuing will, in their aspiration for absolutism, to lead a powerful and menacing empire, regardless of those people far below who get crushed by an iron fist."
m/ivans_childhood," Much more than a war film about a young boy, My Name Is Ivan is a pure film experience."
m/ive_got_issues, Fans of Bob Byington and Miranda July will be at home with the deadpan humor and synecdochal storytelling.
m/ive_loved_you_so_long, Credible tale of the impact on her family and others of a woman who killed her child.
m/ivory_tower," This isn't a thesis film, but one that explores an issue from as many angles as it can in the traditional documentary length of around 90 minutes."
m/ixcanul," As an indictment of how people of privilege continue to exploit and abuse life's have-nots, the movie is devastating."
m/j_edgar," As always, when Eastwood turns his compassionate eye onto the frailties and emotions of his characters, the film flies and reminds us why he remains one of the world's most vital filmmakers."
m/ja_zuster_nee_zuster, Director Pieter Kramer successfully reproduces the bright colors and cheerful ambiance of musical comedies of the 1950s and '60s.
m/jab_tak_hai_jaan," The spirit of Yash Chopra lives on in Jab Tak Hain Jaan, a poignant ode to love."
m/jabberwocky," The cast looks like it was recruited from a Pasolini movie, the budget-concious framing is claustrophobic, and there's way too much smoke"
m/jack-and-diane, Starts with an irresistibly trashy premise and proceeds to treat it with the po-faced pretentiousness of a film-school thesis.
m/jack_and_jill_2011," Feels like an elementary school recess that's gone on too long, the merrymaking strained and the participants looking tired even when they're in full comic dudgeon."
m/jack_brooks_monster_slayer," With a Buffy-like title and a poster that recalls Bruce Campbell at his buffest, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer should have horror fans eager for a little low-budget monster mash chomping at the bit. They won't be disappointed."
m/jack_goes_boating, An encouraging film for the large Philip Seymour Hoffman fan club -- he directs with the same energy and integrity he brings to his acting.
m/jack_goes_home, The film veers almost at random from ghost story to family drama to erotic thriller to black comedy.
m/jack_ketchums_the_girl_next_door, L'exprience que nous propose Wilson se veut si intense et le malaise qui s'en suit si profond qu'il serait surprenant que +ieurs dsirent la vivre une seconde fois
m/jack_of_the_red_hearts," Youth in social and economic crisis today converges with autism, and struggling to come of age in this troubled world. Based on the challenges of the director raising her own autistic child, and raw and real mixed with plenty of tough love empathy too."
m/jack_reacher," Jack Reacher stumbles around looking for a unifying narrative tone, while the star soldiers on, offering up his generic action-hero stance of calm, opaque concentration."
m/jack_reacher_never_go_back, It almost seems as if Cruise is slumming in this one.
m/jack_ryan_shadow_recruit," Pine is never going to successfully pull off weight-of-the-world anxiety: His expression in Shadow Recruit's first moments, set on 9/11, might be called ""aggrieved puppy."""
m/jack_the_giant_killer," Stop-action animation, blue-screen work, matte backgrounds, and a rollicking fantasy story make this one for the ages."
m/jack_the_giant_slayer," Marked by simple narrative and often silly dialogue, Singer's fantasy adventure offers the basic thrills (but no more) expected by fans of this subgenre."
m/jackal," There's a certain novelty factor at work here that may appeal to die-hard Willis fans... As to everyone else, it's hard to imagine why they'd want to bother."
m/jackals_2017," The idea -- is an interesting one, and adds a new spin on the home invasion film, it just fails to really land what it wants to achieve."
m/jackass_3," More often than not, this third installment in the franchise, directed as always by Jeff Tremaine, doesn't take full advantage of its visual potential."
m/jackass_number_2, It's seems so pathetic and desperate Steve-O. You don't need to lose a limb in order to be loved. Enough.
m/jackass_presents_bad_grandpa, Bad Grandpa may not be quite as strong as the perfection that was Jackass Number Two or the outrageousness of Jackass 3D but it is an evolution far beyond the first movie or TV series.
m/jackass_the_movie, Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio.
m/jackboots-on-whitehall," Like a British variation on Team America, this loudly hilarious wartime romp pushes its parallel-reality scenario in some very funny directions, although it perhaps relies too much on postmodern pop-culture references."
m/jacket," You'll either walk away with a headache, or praising filmmaker John Maybury for his unique narrative...and it is unique, but in my eyes, it's also a big giant mess."
m/jackie_2016," A strange, refreshingly cynical, and unexpectedly cerebral account of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's actions in the immediate aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963."
m/jackie_and_ryan, The film comes undone in its clumsy attempts to transform its story into a parable of economic distress.
m/jackie_brown," A slick, sly, soulful story of paranoia, misgivings, a dominant theme of vengeance and a tone of whimsy."
m/jackie_chan_the_myth," Embodies the high-stakes risks inherent in switching between multiple genres, particularly considering the story's central point is nearly lost in the process."
m/jackie_chans_first_strike," Here is crucial dialogue from early in Jackie Chan's First Strike': ""It's me! I found new suspect!'' ""Who is he?'' ""I don't know!'' Right there you have the beauty of the Jackie Chan movies."
m/jacknife," ""Jacknife"" is not a bad film -- it simply fails to say anything new about the post-Vietnam experience."
m/jacobs_ladder," Jacob's Ladder is a hammerhead movie, one that bashes the audience to death with its jazzy technique."
m/jacobs_ladder_2019," As the plot moves forward, it loses interest in the metaphysical torment that made the original so gripping."
m/jade," Writer Joe Eszterhas's follow-up to his Showgirls fiasco is every bit as hopeless, and this time he takes some good actors down with him."
m/jafar_panahis_taxi," It is subtle, humorous and humane. It tells you more about modern Iran, I think, than you'll discover on the news."
m/jagged_edge, So-so thriller that's finally pretty unintentionally funny.
m/jail_bait," The tale of a bad seed immersed in that most horrific of crimes, unregistered gun ownership."
m/jailbait_2004, I wouldn't have thought it was possible to make a prison picture as utterly boring as Jailbait.
m/jailhouse_rock," singing carries the day, just as we'd expect in an Elvis movie"
m/jake_squared," More enervating than it is ambitious, Jake Squared is partly a romantic comedy and mostly a pseudo-philosophical apology for self-absorption."
m/jakob_the_liar, Jakob will have audiences wondering why they're sitting through two hours of Holocaust horrors with so little to drive the plot.
m/jalsaghar," Like a lotus flower, Satyajit Ray's Jalsagbar (The Music Room) gently reveals its enigmatic central character"
m/james_and_the_giant_peach," The story, which I am told varies a great deal from the book, just is not a very good one."
m/james_vs_his_future_self," By focusing on the human element, it becomes an affable, surprisingly-tender dramedy that uses sci-fi as a boost rather than the endgame."
m/james_white," ""James White"" is about broken people barely holding on while trying to cope with unbearable pain, and the experience can be bruising. But without ever feeling the need to show you hope or redemption, a recognizably real humanity still bleeds through."
m/jamesy_boy," Burns has overcome a lot of hardship in his life, and his story is truly inspiring, but not everybody's story needs to be a movie."
m/jamie_marks_is_dead," The film uses its phantasmagoric conceit, a sickly-hued poetry, and eerie sound design to build metaphors for closeted homoeroticism and melancholic unfulfillment."
m/jandek-on-corwood," Not the year's best documentary, but it's the one most likely to stick in your mind for days."
m/jane_eyre_2011," Fukunaga's superbly executed direction and careful staging speak very rarely, and yet say so much."
m/jane_got_a_gun, Whatever feminist angle the film might have once aspired to is lost in its listless shuffle.
m/jane_wants_a_boyfriend," ""Jane's"" affecting emotional core and cathartic conclusion carry the day."
m/jane_white_is_sick_and_twisted, Achieves that rare balancing act of skewering a subject while simultaneously paying homage to it.
m/janes_journey_2010," Intriguing and inspirational, it's a beguiling film in every way."
m/janie_jones," Not only reveals that Abigail Breslin as an incredibly talented singer, but an actress who can take a subpar script, breathe life into it and make it somewhat enjoyable, too."
m/janis_little_girl_blue," The film is tasked with cramming an entire life into the minimum of time, and it often comes up short when it comes to canny explorations and richer examinations of both Joplin's individual life and her greater legacy."
m/jannat_2, It never lives up to the cheeky-rogue promise of its first scenes.
m/japanese_story, Fans of Toni Collette and alien environments will find this trip worth taking
m/japon, The one thing that is clear from Japn is that a major new visual stylist has hit the screen and that Reygadas' first film represents the beginning of an auspicious career.
m/jason_becker_not_dead_yet," An intense, emotional ride. Uplifting and inspiring."
m/jason_bourne, Visceral echoes of real life accidentally make the over-the-top action feel more prescient than anyone could have intended.
m/jason_goes_to_hell_the_final_friday," That the end result is convoluted, lacking in logical coherence, and sometimes downright silly is not ideal, but you can sense the genuine desire to take the story in a new direction"
m/jason_x," Deserving of immediate X-cision and X-termination, and its makers forced to to perform some act of X-piation for it."
m/jauja," It's a film of fussy, cultivated austerity; Alonsolytes will debate what it's hiding, while others will suggest ""an actual movie"" as the answer."
m/java_heat," The film's anthropological interest in Indonesia is the smartest thing in an otherwise familiar scramble of kidnapped babes, expensive jewelry and millions of bullets."
m/jawbreaker," Why sit through a lesser imitation, when you could just rent Heathers and those other movies for a far more enjoyable time?"
m/jaws," Like Hitchcock, nothing is thrown in without serving a purpose."
m/jaws_2," Suspension of disbelief might have been possible had this been a ripping good yarn; but the kids are just plain silly, and it's a toss-up to decide which is more unconvincing, the shark or Scheider."
m/jaws_3," The shark gets more time on screen than before only it's not a wise decision, as it remarkably looks cheaper than in the last film."
m/jaws_the_revenge," The shark models have so little movement that at times they seem to be supporting themselves on boats, instead of attacking them. Up until the ludicrous final sequence of the movie, the scariest creature in the film is an eel."
m/jay_and_silent_bob_reboot," Smith has every right to be older and wiser here, and ""Jay and Silent Bob Reboot,"" with its gentle anarchy and not-quite-mock nostalgia, is a time-machine sequel that passes the time amiably enough."
m/jay_and_silent_bob_strike_back," Smith set out to make a bad movie, then accidentally created a pretty good one. ** INTERVIEWS! **"
m/jayne_mansfields_car," A triumphant return to directing for Billy Bob Thornton. It's maybe not as monumental as Sling Blade, but it's a fine piece of character work with an unmistakable Thornton touch."
m/jazz-on-a-summers-day-1960, Bert Stern's one film compels in capturing musical spirit before gatherings of the tribe became commercial orchestrated total-package mega-spectacles.
m/jcvd," Switching it up from dumb and dumber action thrillers to smart alek moviemaking, JCVD is Van Damme's girlie man unplugged, and literally his own worst enemy. It's no Dog Day Afternoon, but still a sensitive tough guy mock reality show with balls."
m/jds_revenge," Once we figure out this basic situation, we're on familiar ground; diabolical possessions are as commonplace in the movies these days as love scenes used to be. But J.D.'s Revenge adds a couple of twists."
m/jean_michel_basquiat_the_radiant_child_2010, Lively and touching doc combines insider view of its art-star subject with smart present-day interviews.
m/jeanne_dielman_23_quai_du_commerce_1080_bruxelles," Jeanne Dielman can initially absorb, fascinate but, ultimately, ends up less than the sum of its parts"
m/jeepers_creepers," Two of filmdom's biggest idiots get involved in a really creepy, scary horror story."
m/jeepers_creepers_2," Even when the boys in the film do manage to put their clothes back on, it's only a matter of time before the Creeper takes them off (amongst other things)."
m/jeepers_creepers_3," Lacking in imagination or genuine scares, Jeepers Creepers 3 falls tragically short on just about every front."
m/jeff_who_lives_at_home," A cleverer script could have made its point and remained tactfully agnostic, but it's still amusing to see mumblecore's trademark naturalism leavened by some old-fashioned movie magic."
m/jefferson_in_paris," What is it about? Revolution? History? Slavery? Romance? No doubt a lot of research and speculation went into Jhabvala's screenplay, but I wish she had finally decided to jump one way or the other. The movie tells no clear story and has no clear ideas."
m/jeffrey," If nothing else, Rudnick and director Christopher Ashley know how to keep the audience off balance and in stitches."
m/jeg_er_din," How to be a mother, a lover and an aspiring actress all at once?"
m/jellyfish_eyes," Though it may amuse hardcore devotees of kaiju film on video, the film hardly threatens to make Murakami the next Julian Schnabel."
m/jem_and_the_holograms_2015, Intercutting the story's action with eclectic performance clips from YouTube delivers the film's most intriguing point. You're going to find much more raw talent online than anywhere else in this movie.
m/jen_kirkman_im_gonna_die_alone," The end result is a nicely discursive hour-+ of standup, one that covers familiar topics but stands out due to material that sounds bitter without being embittered."
m/jennifer_8, Bruce Robinson's Hollywood debut is much better than generally thought
m/jennifers_body," Gory rather than scary, mean-spirited rather than funny, Jennifer's Body is a nasty piece of work."
m/jenny_slate_stage_fright," Slate-like so many women-has more than one self, and she shows us a few of them in Stage Fright."
m/jennys_wedding," It all feels outdated, simplistic and insulting to both the characters and the audience."
m/jeremiah_johnson," Like other films of the 1970s, Pollack's saga combines nostalgia and cynicism in equal measure, thus pleasing both right-wing and left-wing viewers, not to speak the delight of seeing Robert Redford at his most handsome in a cowboy attire."
m/jerichow," We imagine his burning gaze and labored breath behind every wide shot that depicts Thomas and Laura's trysts, providing the sterile visuals with a voyeuristic intensity."
m/jerk," The next time Marting considers a script like BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE, he should watch this and remember when he was funny."
m/jerry_before_seinfeld," It was such a pleasure to sink down into these jokes with Seinfeld, such a treat to be carried along by such a confident professional. It's rare to be treated this way by any piece of current entertainment; enjoy his achievement here."
m/jerry_seinfeld_23_hours_to_kill," Seinfeld presents as an ordinary shmoe at one with the common man, save for his ability to weave shared experiences into comedy gold. Still bearing that signature high-pitched voice of exasperation, he strikes a high laugh-per-minute rate from the get-go."
m/jersey_boys," It works in the hits, and it casts singers who make those hits sound virtually identical to the originals. What the movie doesn't do is answer the question, ""Why did I just spend 134 minutes watching the Frankie Valli episode of 'Behind the Music'?"""
m/jersey_girl," Affleck, who often seems confused on screen . . . uses that quirk as Ollie matches wits with a kid who is not only smarter, but also probably more mature than he is"
m/jersey_shore_massacre," Acknowledging Hurricane Sandy, ""Jersey Shore Massacre"" reminds viewers that it's hardly the worst disaster to hit the region. But it gives the Hindenburg stiff competition."
m/jerusalem_2013," Laudable for turning armchair tourism into a breathtaking experience - a viewer can truly feel as if he or she has gone inside a number of fantastic, ancient places."
m/jerusalema, It's a rich portrait made all the more worrying by apparently being based on actual events.
m/jessabelle, The depths prove awfully shallow in this murky and derivative bayou gothic.
m/jesus, Fernando Guzzoni's Jesus is at its best when it steers clear of pat moralizing and simply yokes its moody sense of atmosphere to the aimlessness of the story's young characters.
m/jesus_camp," Like the filmmakers' award-winning Boys of Baraka, Jesus Camp examines the relationship between education and social context."
m/jesus_christ_vampire_hunter, It will offend those who are offended by the very title; it will probably thrill those who take one look at the title and immediately want to see the film.
m/jesus_henry_christ," Pleasant without being revelatory, underwhelming but not obnoxiously so, the film explores how we become who we are, whether by genetics or environment or some combination of the two."
m/jesus_shows_you_the_way_to_the_highway," Not every shabby, cheap DIY touch is cute. But for laughs, it's hard to go far astray when ""Jesus Shows You the Way to the Highway."""
m/jesus_son," Despite the occasional miscalculation and disappointing last half-hour, an estimable piece of work."
m/jesus_you_know, The film proves the dramatic power of the cinematic close-up by not including a single one.
m/jet_lag," Seen for what it is, the film is enjoyable, though nothing sticks in the mind when the lights come up."
m/jewel_of_the_nile," While it's definitely not an awful little adventure flick, Jewel of the Nile stands as a pretty good indication as to why the guys never reunited for a third adventure."
m/jews_and_baseball_an_american_love_story," I doubt there's much here any die-hard fan doesn't already know, but having it retold from the perspective of a struggling, respect-hungry community merely makes the metaphoric affinities of the game that much more persuasive."
m/jewtopia," It's a movie that thinks it stands for openness and cultural understanding, underneath the poop jokes, when in fact it manages to be offensive to almost everyone, including people who like to laugh at something because it's funny ..."
m/jexi," The stranded DeVine, for all his goofy charms as an actor, quickly exhausts our patience; he's in nearly every frame of this movie, and his screen partner is a phone, which means a hell of a lot of mugging for the camera."
m/jhoom_barabar_jhoom," Flirtatious repartee between glamorous stars in travel-poster international locations; a gratifyingly simple plot with puzzles and sleight-of-hand surprises; and, at regular intervals, outbursts of gaudy, energetic dancing infectiously exploding."
m/jianyu_2010," There's little about Chao-Bin's other work to suggest the splendidly choreographed ballets of swordplay that feature here, with Woo's dexterous hand obvious in the fight scenes."
m/jiao_you_2013," Tsai's latest is small and human and primal-a howl from the gutter, and a survival story about life on the fringe, in which a family of four ekes out an existence one day and scavenged meal at a time."
m/jig," While it's easy to sneer at the tweens and their scary parents, you can't ignore their dedication to their dying art, nor their kinetic energy."
m/jigsaw_2017, Jigsaw is the law of diminishing returns elevated to lamentable levels
m/jim_and_andy_the_great_beyond_featuring_a_very_special_contractually_obligated_mention_of_tony_clifton, It makes for powerful and stimulating viewing whether or not a game is being played with viewers.
m/jim_gaffigan_cinco," Over the last 15 years, Gaffigan has proven himself to be one of our most intelligent observational humorists, and that trend continues the 74-minute set that makes up Cinco."
m/jim_gaffigan_noble_ape," If the show's hilarious first half gives way to a more modestly amusing second part, ""Noble Ape"" remains good, clean, relatable fun."
m/jim_gaffigan_obsessed," The bulk of his comedy is, as always, his ""obsession"" with food and his observations are truly hilarious, ranging from eating ice cream to lusting after donuts to trying to figure out seafood."
m/jim_gaffigan_quality_time," If that smacks suspiciously of brand solidification after the near career-derailment Jeannie's illness temporarily brought about, Quality Time is at least quality old-school Gaffigan."
m/jim_the_james_foley_story," ""Jim"" is at once an intimate portrait of a restless spirit and a family's journey to understand him, as well as a treatise on the state of international conflict journalism and world news in today's market."
m/jimi_all_is_by_my_side," ...a Hendrix movie without the full Hendrix story, seminal Hendrix songs, all in a portrait of a man that doesn't really feel like Hendrix at all."
m/jimmy_and_judy," For all their surface bluster, debuting co-writers/directors Jon Schroder and Randall K. Rubin are trading in reflexive sulky adolescent philosophy."
m/jimmy_neutron_boy_genius," Though Nickelodeon insists the target audience is six to 14 year olds, the plot, characters and design seem far more appropriate for preschoolers."
m/jimmy_p," At its heart a tale of redemption, played through a culture-clash dynamic as the French analyst and his patient build a relationship, and it's hard to resist the similarities with The King's Speech."
m/jin_roh_the_wolf_brigade," Suffers from a rambling, allegory-laden storyline that makes it nearly impossible to follow."
m/jindabyne," Technically excellent in every department, the film tells the story with great verve and at a well judged pace, but the strong emotional content seems to stay on the screen, without translating to the deeply moving experience we hanker for."
m/jing_cha_gu_shi_2013," It makes fans of the original ""Police Story"" franchise wistful for the mundane locales but extraordinary daredevil stunt work of yore."
m/jingle_all_the_way," You'll need an awful lot of Christmas cheer to forgive Arnold Schwarzenegger for his fourth, and hopefully last, venture into comedy, a turkey that needs stuffing on the most inaccessible shelf of your local video store."
m/jingle_bell_rocks, The best-selling singles in America have been Christmas songs and Kezin's look at the b-side -- the business of Xmas -- is entertaining.
m/jinn_2014," Clunky, missing engaging elements of franchise filmmaking that would make the viewer beg for a continuation. What's here is a cluttered snooze that limps to a conclusion."
m/jinn_2018," In ""Jinn,"" a young, black Muslim woman finds her spirit amid cultural restraints. And in that regard, ""Jinn"" is a winner."
m/jiro_dreams_of_sushi," In Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Gelb details, among other things, the painstaking process that goes into creating these mouthwatering pieces of sushi."
m/jo_jo_dancer_your_life_is_calling," If it hadn't been directed by its subject, it would have been a great disservice. As such, it's just a major disappointment."
m/joan-rivers-a-piece-of-work, What is most surprising is not the dilligence with which Sundberg and Stern set about following the course of Rivers through a year of her life - although that is certainly in evidence - but how incredibly welcoming she is to their scrutiny
m/joan_didion_the_center_will_not_hold, Some of the things I'd heard here would not leave me alone for days.
m/joannas-flower-power-flower-design2007," A lovely performance by Ethiopian supermodel-actress Liya Kebede as supermodel-activist Waris Dirie works wonders to elevate this uneven, occasionally awkward but often absorbing film."
m/jobriath_ad_2012," Fast-paced and colourful, this documentary chronicles the astonishing story of a gifted artist who never found the success everyone knew he deserved."
m/jobs," This is far from the bomb some would have envisaged, but neither is it the character illumination one would wish for."
m/jodhaa_akbar," Bollywood films, more than films from anywhere else in the world, harken back to the heyday of the Hollywood studio star system with all the glamour and gloss that goes with that."
m/jodorowskys_dune," This is a film that is largely about Jodorowsky himself... but also about the way sci-fi movies have grown, changed, and mutated over the years."
m/joe," A raw, tough movie of enormous power, with a riveting performance from Peter Boyle as the avenging devil."
m/joe_2013," Cage excels as Joe here: amongst all of the larger-than-life southern characters in the film, Cage's performance seems almost subdued and he is completely convincing."
m/joe_dirt, You Should Pay Nine Bucks for This If: You really liked Stuart Saves His Family. This is just as good as that one.
m/joe_dirt_2_beautiful_loser," You'd think that after 14 years, they'd have more than stale fart jokes and weak callbacks to bits that weren't funny in the first place."
m/joe_kidd," It's still a prime example of a good, sturdy bread-and-butter Western."
m/joe_somebody, Joe Nobody becomes Joe Somebody after he gives it to the man.
m/joe_strummer_the_future_is_unwritten," Celebrates Strummer's fecundity and self-invention and honors his reticence and private despair, reminding us along the way what a contradictory and amazing affair a single human life is."
m/joe_the_king, An excellent piece of entertainment. The cast is undeniably brilliant.
m/joe_versus_the_volcano," Joe Versus the Volcano achieves a kind of magnificent goofiness. Hanks and Ryan are the right actors to inhabit it, because you can never catch them going for a gag that isn't there: They inhabit the logic of this bizarre world and play by its rules."
m/joes_apartment," There's not enough story here for something half that length, so we're subjected to numerous pointless and irritating song-and-dance numbers designed to nudge the lame plot towards its conclusion."
m/joffrey_mavericks_of_american_dance," There's a lot of valuable information here, but for all the archival footage on view, dance is rarely allowed to make its effect."
m/john_carpenters_ghosts_of_mars, A hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences.
m/john_carpenters_vampires, ...little more than an excuse to watch people kill each other in the most brutal possible ways.
m/john_carter," Often spectacular, with stunning action and thrilling moments, it's a film that captures the pulpy, swashbuckling sensibilities of Burroughs while updating much of the whiz bang for an audience a century older than the original novels."
m/john_dies_at_the_end," In Coscarelli's reprehensibly lazy adaptation, much of which is copied note-for-note from Pargin's book, shit happens at a furious pace, and almost none of it is adequately explained."
m/john_henry_2020," Crews steps up to the increased responsibility, and his performance as the stoic, upstanding title character is the best part of Will Forbes' muddled debut feature."
m/john_leguizamos_latin_history_for_morons," Leguizamo's history class is not an end all, be all-it leaves out pieces of Central American history I would have liked to see-but rather serves as a starting point, and he's the perfect educator for the task."
m/john_lewis_good_trouble, John Lewis: Good Trouble is absolutely inspiring - but it stops a bit short of being illuminating.
m/john_mellencamp_its_about_you, A striking musical documentary about rock singer and songwriter John Mellencamp and the changes overtaking this musical genre and the heartland of America.
m/john_mulaney_and_the_sack_lunch_bunch," Mulaney's in total control, and yet completely out of his element."
m/john_mulaney_kid_gorgeous_at_radio_city," The first half of the special seems a little slow in general... But somewhere around the middle - somewhere around a Mick Jagger impression, which sounds terrible but isn't - it takes flight. After that, it's very good."
m/john_q," The criticism never rises above easy, cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters..."
m/john_rambo," One of the most grotesque, gruesome and gory movies you will ever see. I started having 'Nam flashbacks, and I wasn't even born then. I need to rent Cinderella, so I can feel clean again."
m/john_tucker_must_die," some of the most entertaining trailers and commercials of the year, but they should have hired that editor to make the whole movie"
m/john_waters_this_filthy_world," Even though I've heard quite of bit of his show before, I still enjoyed it."
m/john_wick, This is the most entertaining Keanu Reeves action vehicle since THE MATRIX. JOHN WICK is a wild and bloody ride that hardly lets up until the final frame.
m/john_wick_chapter_2," Sit back and enjoy the stunts, the speed, the style."
m/john_wick_chapter_3_parabellum," A balletic, radiant, and relentless feat of action filmmaking, captured with the kind of clear-eyed, pleasure-filled elegance reminiscent of Jacques Demy."
m/johnny-got-his-gun2008," Unless viewers are aficionados of solo shows and want to see every one they can, this effort comes off as forced, far too self-aware and unfortunately dated."
m/johnny_be_good, The people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves.
m/johnny_english," Por mais que tente, Johnny English não é páreo para o Inspetor Closeau, Derek Flint ou Austin Powers. Aliás, não é páreo sequer para Mr. Bean."
m/johnny_english_reborn," Is funnier and more complete than the original, with Atkinson in fine fettle, displaying the unique style of comedy he has honed into an artform"
m/johnny_english_strikes_again_2018," Screenwriter William Davies has to tread carefully, not pushing the implicit conservatism too far: English is skeptical about women in the military, for instance, but eventually learns to move with the times."
m/johnny_frank_garretts_last_word, Rumley's first foray into the (possibly) supernatural... this story - of a convicted killer taking vengeance from beyond the grave against those who conspired to sentence him to death - comes with an unusual grounding in reality.
m/johnny_got_his_gun," Sadly, time has not made this story any less relevant or potent."
m/johnny_guitar, The film makes much to do about sexual role-reversals.
m/johnny_handsome, A stylish and tough crime-thriller with that underlying mournfulness which characterizes Hill's best work.
m/johnny_mnemonic, You can have a better time title-scanning Johnny pics in an alphabetical video guide than you can enduring the latest Blade Runner knockoff: Johnny Mnemonic.
m/johnny_suede, Pitt's tendency to turn into a space cadet without a well-defined archetype to play slows the movie's pacing to a crawl
m/johnson_family_vacation," Johnson Family is, basically, National Lampoon's Vacation with darker skin and a better star. But the Lampoon movie had quite a bit of comedy happening around its star, and Johnson doesn't."
m/johnstown_flood," Johnstown Flood is the kind of movie I wouldn't have minded watching in school. It concurrently educates and entertains. While it's not perfect, it's still a worthy introduction to an American tragedy."
m/joker_2019," Joaquin Phoenix kills it in dark, timely DC origin movie that is no laughing matter. Will he be second Joker to win an Oscar?"
m/joker_3d, Kunder has devised a simplistic story which has no coherent format.
m/jolene," While its lumpy story drags long before its running time is up, the film serves as the perfect showcase for new star Jessica Chastain, a dazzling redhead whose talent and radiance keeps its many parts watchable."
m/joli_mai," It's never fully uninflected like authentic vrit, but the material gets at a kind of truth: the chatty anxieties of shopkeepers, passersby, mothers and sons, all grappling with the changing world of May 1962."
m/jonah_a_veggietales_movie," Kids five and up will be delighted with the fast, funny, and even touching story. Parents may even find that it goes by quickly, because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year, including those intended for adults."
m/jonah_hex," Although it's got the shortest running time of anything we've seen all year, Jonah Hex doesn't feel so much snappily paced as it does rushed and disjointed."
m/jonas_brothers_3d," This tepid concert film does the Jonas Brothers no favors, not that the band's tweener fans will notice."
m/jonathan_2018," Jonathan does end up feeling like a hybrid of Fight Club and Charlie Kaufman... And in the end, it doesn't feel like Jonathan fully commits to its own premise."
m/jonathan_livingston_seagull, Truly one of the most boring pictures ever done but with enough attractive photography to merit your brief attention.
m/joneses," Borte supports his jewel of a story idea with dead-on casting, stunning images and product placement that's intentionally heavy-handed."
m/joseph_and_the_amazing_technicolor_dreamcoat, A flamboyant interpretation of the classic Webber-Rice rock musical.
m/joshua," If you can appreciate complex, slow-burn dramas and forego the buckets of blood, then you're likely to agree with me when I say that Joshua is among the best of films of its genre to come along in quite some time."
m/joshua_tree_1951_a_portrait_of_james_dean_2012," Mishory's film walks the same forlorn street as that of Bruce Weber's 1988 Chet Baker documentary, Let's Get Lost, and shares its palpable fascination for an iconic individual cursed by both beauty and artistic genius."
m/joshy," Ace performances all around, each perching on the razor's edge between comedy and tragedy, and falling freely from one side to the other."
m/josie, [Josie's] third-act twist is so astonishingly obvious as to be completely and totally unforgivable.
m/josie_and_the_pussycats," If its ragtag heroines are as wholesome as ice-cream cones and as skimpily dressed as Hooters servers, at least they are not conformist mallrats."
m/joueuse, Misrepresents the difficulties of women with no semi-marketable talents at freeing themselves from their own domestic grind.
m/journey-to-italy-viaggio-in-italia," An influence on everyone from Michelangelo Antonioni to Jacques Rivette, this brave work still stands as a watershed."
m/journey_of_hope_1991, This surprise winner of the Best Foreign Language Oscar centers on a poor Turkish couple looking for work in Swizerland
m/journey_of_natty_gann, Another fondly remembered Disney flick absolutely flushed down the toilet by a pathetic full frame transfer. Sad news indeed.
m/journey_to_the_center_of_the_earth," ...solid family fun...good juvenile entertainment that adults can appreciate, too."
m/journey_to_the_center_of_the_earth_2008," The comin'-at-ya effects are certainly state of the art ... but any hopes that the film might blaze new trails are squashed the first time someone picks up a paddleball. Kids should lap it up; for anyone else, Dramamine is advised."
m/journey_to_the_center_of_the_earth_2_3d, Go on this 3D journey with low expectations and you won't be disappointed.
m/journey_to_the_west_2014," As a director of kinetic slapstick action, Chow remains unparalleled."
m/journey_to_the_west_the_demons_strike_back_2017," This time round, though, there's more high-spirited whimsy than laugh-out-loud humour."
m/journeys_end_2018," A robust, sinewy production that honours the film's enduring themes and proves that it has stood the test of time."
m/joy_2014," The splendidly dextrous cast ensures that this goofy success story, which could just easily be titled American Hustle 2, keeps firing on all cylinders in the manner of the writer-director's previous few outings."
m/joy_luck_club," There's no ignoring the fact that The Joy Luck Club is a moving work, both a contemporary and an eternal story about the interlinked boundaries between mothers and daughters."
m/joy_of_life," A transfixing, unforgettable new half personal essay, half documentary."
m/joy_ride, Film is infused with John Dahl's terrific sense of the macabre.
m/joy_ride_3_road_kill, Joy Ride 3 is a serviceable enough gore fest and the actors are all up to par.
m/joyeux_noel, A powerful antiwar statement based on historical events
m/joyful_noise_2011," Despite the sheer volume of music on offer, very little of it feels authentic -- or especially inspiring."
m/jsa-joint-security-area-aka-gongdong-gyeongbi-guyeok," Park's film reveals its double agency by swinging between emotion-charged flashbacks of weepie male bonding and the investigative longueurs of the icy, half-Korean, half-Swedish female officer in charge of mopping up the brotherly bloodbath."
m/jt_leroy," The story of JT LeRoy, the best-selling author who never really existed, gets the standard biopic treatment in Justin Kelly's unfortunately uninspired Jeremiah Terminator LeRoy."
m/ju_dou, As sumptuously cinematic as it is woefully fatalistic.
m/juan_of_the_dead_2011," Juan of The Dead is rough and ready, the effects are a little shoddy, the comedy is broad and sometimes homophobic but there are just enough whimsical moments and deadpan hilarity to make it worthwhile."
m/juanita_2019, The only thing keeping this movie from completely driving off the road is Alfre Woodard.
m/judd_apatow_the_return," This all feels a bit mechanical, a problem confounded because this is a very American set, flitting magpie-like between subjects, with no arguments developed, no narrative, and nothing terrifically compelling to say."
m/jude," The novel's vast scope includes some pointed social critique, and the film gets the gist of it...But the romance is very thinly outlined."
m/judge_dredd," There's a few things done right, but they are outweighed by many misfires."
m/judgment_night," A tight, energetic sleeper in the action-adventure genre, manages to pack a few anti-machismo sentiments into an otherwise brawny tale."
m/judy_2019," Goold's movie sometimes stumbles, but it made one indispensable choice in finding the right actress to channel the diva."
m/judy_and_punch," A tonally complex comedy-drama about spousal abuse, infant mortality and misogyny told with magic tricks, puppets and slapstick."
m/judy_moody_and_the_not_bummer_summer, A for-small-children movie that excludes everyone else.
m/jug_face," Intriguing without ever proving insightful, the film nonetheless has a formal patience and meticulousness that sets it apart from its jump-scare-loving mainstream-horror brethren."
m/juggernaut_2018," DiMarco's noir-inflected family drama is confident and mature, but less involving than it could be, because the filmmaker and his star make their anti-hero stubbornly unappealing."
m/juice," Dickerson's story of street kids at risk breaks no new ground. It is better than most, but not by much. Sure looks good, though."
m/jules_and_jim," Truffaut's filmmaking revolve[s] around the great Moreau, who returns the compliment with one of the most memorable performances in screen history."
m/julie_and_julia," Like a fallen soufflé, this movie delivers flavor but not the dizzying deliciousness it promises."
m/julien_donkeyboy," The odds are good that most people will dislike this film and be offended by it. For others, it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn. You know who you are."
m/juliet_naked," Juliet, Naked is a hilarious adaptation of Nick Hornsby's book that centers on a quirky man's obsession with one rockstar that hinders a romantic relationship."
m/juliet_of_the_spirits, Fellini went deliriously and brilliantly bananas with the color to create a rollicking through-the- looking-glass series of tableaus evoking a woman's troubled psyche.
m/julieta_2016, A film that's never conventional or predictable. [Full review in Spanish]
m/jumanji_the_next_level," Unfortunately this movie's plot seems a bit forced, with a wafer thin reason for the original gang to go back into the video game."
m/jumanji_welcome_to_the_jungle," The action scenes are satisfying, and the effects, fun, if not earthshaking. But the best thing about Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle may be how well-crafted it is."
m/jump_shot_the_kenny_sailors_story," Hamilton does a great job not only educating us about Kenny's impact on basketball and his career, but also gives us a window into what kind of man he was."
m/jump_tomorrow, The sweetness at the core of the raggedy low-budget romantic comedy Jump Tomorrow is hard to resist.
m/jumper," As a travelogue, Jumper isn't half bad, with lots of juicy images of Rome, Tokyo, New York and other splendid places. But we're supposed to be watching a sci-fi action film, and that's where things go south."
m/jumping_the_broom, Family matriarchs played by Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine go up against each other in a wedding comedy that grows increasingly unfunny with each passing minute.
m/junebug," It's sometimes said that Southerners rejoice in their eccentrics and put them out on the porch for full display, rather than push them in the closet. Indeed, the filmmakers have given us a nicely filled porch."
m/jungle_2017," A true story of horror and trauma, the most extreme battle between man and nature that we can imagine. But it's also an inspiring story of faith, and loyalty, and the ineffable resilience of the human spirit."
m/jungle_2_jungle," Jungle 2 Jungle still finds time to appreciate Mr. Allen's easy way with a child actor, an audience or a heavily tranquilized pet cat."
m/jungle_book_2," In a time when sequels rarely live up to the original, its flawless, lighthearted entertainment will please everyone."
m/juno," Dialogue and pic overall are saved from cloying glibness by the fact that Juno is not only a smarty-pants, but also genuinely smart and self-possessed, even if her condition occasionally threatens her composure."
m/jupiter_ascending_2014," An over-stimulating, intergalactic odyssey evocative of The Wizard of Oz."
m/jupiters_wife," She may have a screw or two loose, but she's always engaging to listen to"
m/jurassic_park," Clich or no, there's no getting around it - quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time."
m/jurassic_park_iii, Compared to some of this summer's blockbusters ... this is better than average.
m/jurassic_world," Even with its flaws, Jurassic World works, thanks to director Colin Trevorrow's great sense of pacing and flair for drama that transcends the idea of beasts chasing humans."
m/jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom," The visual effects are beyond spectacular, and the dinos are the star players, especially the new and downright scary hybrid."
m/juror," Despite its big names and slick sheen, [the film] fails to make a convincing case."
m/jury_duty," Disappointing, even for a Pauly Shore comedy. Not much satire, and the ending with the evil juror just makes no sense."
m/just-another-love-story-kaerlighed-pa-film, Just Another Love Story has all the foolhardy bluster of a talentless film student nagging at us to acknowledge his artistry.
m/just_45_minutes_from_broadway_2012," Though Jaglom intends for us to be charmed by show folk, the amateurish performances and perennially misjudged direction wind up portraying them instead as boundlessly needy narcissists."
m/just_a_kiss, It just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on (or be entertained by).
m/just_another_girl_on_the_irt, Remove the swearing and the hip-hop soundtrack and it would make a fine after-school special.
m/just_before_i_go," Anchored by a nicely understated performance by Seann William Scott, ""Just Before I Go"" effectively juggles a wealth of genuine, at times profound, emotion with quite a bit of nutty-raunchy humor."
m/just_buried, Blame the Brits for making this kind of morbid farce look easy...
m/just_cause," There is no psychological depth, no real motivation, no human values to weigh, just characters jerked here and there like puppets in an arbitrary plot."
m/just_charlie, One of most moving and insightful films about the trans experience ever made.
m/just_do_it_a_tale_of_modern_day_outlaws," Engaging and frequently eye-opening documentary that gives a valuable voice to a section of the protest movement that's often dismissed by the media, though the film loses focus in the second half and runs out of things to say."
m/just_friends," A succession of frantic, and frequently brutal, slapstick episodes...raucous but largely mirthless."
m/just_getting_started," A rather lazy boondoggle by Shelton, who waited 14 years to direct again and didn't bother to make it worthwhile."
m/just_go_with_it_2010," Cheaper than a flight to Honolulu, with probably a few more laughs."
m/just_like_a_woman_2013," While one can sympathize with the subjects Bouchareb is exploring here, his picture strives for a great deal more than it actually delivers."
m/just_like_heaven, Idealized romance is all about chemical connections and random mumbo jumbo. Just Like Heaven does a solid job of boiling that brew
m/just_married," The filmmakers themselves betray a lack of knowledge about the Old World, while unfailingly repeating physical hijinks one time too many."
m/just_mercy," Yet Jordan and Foxx take the little material they're given and play it as deep as possible, turning in memorable, eventually gut-punching performances."
m/just_my_luck, Features Li.Lo doing what Li.Lo does best: Pretending to be one kind of person (lucky/unpopular/a teenager/one twin/not a race car driver) and then pretending to be the exact opposite (unlucky/popular/a mom/the other twin/a race car driver).
m/just_one_of_the_guys, Just One of the Guys  is a charming and wild 1980s teen comedy anchored by Joyce Hyser's charismatic and unexpectedly committed performance.
m/just_visiting, Wasn't one iota funnier when I regained consciousness than it was when I mercifully slipped out of it.
m/just_wright," You know these two are meant to be together, and the de rigueur obstacles that stand in their way are visible from a mile off."
m/justice_2011, It's not that 'Justice' doesn't achieve its goals - but the goals are so modest that disappointment is inevitable.
m/justice_league_2017," The gang is all here as DC Comics finally brings together its brooding bigwigs for a lugubrious, deafening and occasionally (but only occasionally) enjoyable team-up."
m/justice_league_dark," Justice League Dark is worthy of the R-rating. It's markedly violent and truly dwells in the mystical realm, but is burdened by an overly intricate plot with multiple characters."
m/justice_league_dark_apokolips_war," The no holds barred, post-apocalyptic tale impressively weaves together threads from Flashpoint, Justice League Dark and Son of Batman in an epic conclusion."
m/justice_league_gods_and_monsters," Another solid entry in the DCU line, Justice League: Gods and Monsters works best as an entrée into what should be a fascinating and highly entertaining series of its own. [Blu-ray/DVD]"
m/justice_league_throne_of_atlantis," I think I'll call this review: ""The time I was outrageously disappointed by the generic and rehashed Aquaman origin story!"""
m/justice_league_vs_the_fatal_five, Superheroes encounter brutal villains from future; violence.
m/justice_league_war, Justice League: War loses the battle mostly by biting off more story than it can comfortably chew.
m/justin_and_the_knights_of_valour," Even Banderas' character feels like a cheap knock-off, who is not fit to polish the boots of Puss."
m/justin_bieber_never_say_never," Though anyone who needs convincing won't touch this one with a 10-foot pole, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never makes a persuasive case for its titular star as a far more talented-than-usual teen idol."
m/justin_biebers_believe," A documentary that supposedly chronicles the 2012-2013 tour but stays so relentlessly on message, it offers no insights and few anecdotes about the real Justin Bieber."
m/justin_timberlake_the_tennessee_kids," Certainly it's possible that a live JT concert would entertain. But can this special achieve anything more? Oh, yes."
m/juwanna_mann," As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game, Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre, and a personal low for everyone involved."
m/k19_the_widowmaker, This submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to Das Boot.
m/k_11," Jules Stewart makes a confident directorial debut. Although the screenplay comes perilously close at times to sensationalizing or stereotyping the characters, Stewart wisely resists."
m/kabhi_alvida_naa_kehna," At over three hours long it's left to the lighter comic moments, provided by Amitabh Bachchan as an outrageously flirtatious pensioner, to keep the momentum going."
m/kabhi_khushi_kabhie_gham," A well made film, with some magical moments (hilarious and weepy) and possibly the world's best looking family!"
m/kabluey," This charming, pointed comedy is a genuine discovery."
m/kaboom_2010, You have to admire [Araki's] sense of style and ambition even if the convoluted narrative begins to grate.
m/kaena_the_prophecy," Despite several striking images and a high technical polish, this picture is just generic fantasy."
m/kagemusha," Though not as overall impressive as his next picture Ran, Kagemusha, Akira Kurosawa's return to the epic Samurai film deservedly received Oscar nominations for its great pictorial beauty and other production values."
m/kalamity," ""Kalamity"" is the kind of indie suspense thriller that gives indies a bad name."
m/kaleidoscope_2017, The plot doesn't always stack up but the two Joneses combine to create a psychological thriller with an extremely oppressive atmosphere.
m/kalifornia," The movie begins extremely well before escalating into the inevitable Straw Dogs confrontation, when the sensitive-intellectual man discovers, just like Dustin Hoffman, that when push comes to shove, we're all brutes and animals."
m/kamp-katrina, Ashley Sabin and David Redmon's bittersweet film documents the efforts of two New Orleans natives to help their beloved city heal from Hurricane Katrina's devastation.
m/kangaroo_jack, A shrill and silly farce in which a CGI marsupial seems more lifelike than most of its flesh-and-blood co-stars.
m/kansas_city," A sadly ordinary motion picture, and, in less sure hands, it might have been something of an unfortunate mess. Even with Altman at the helm, however, it manages to be singularly unremarkable."
m/kansas_city_confidential," Terse and tough, Kansas City Confidential is one of the great lean, mean B crime thrillers..."
m/karate_kid," A warm-heartened riff on the tried-and-true Rocky formula, and one of the better cinematic icons of the 1980s."
m/karate_kid_2010," The Karate Kid is fun, and believable, on the most important level: It convinces us that Jaden Smith has what it takes to fight his way to the top."
m/karate_kid_part_2," Even as sequels go in this era of movie mega-series, ''The Karate Kid Part II'' peters out faster than most."
m/karl_marx_city, This documentary will help to convince you that Soviet style Communism forced on people of East Germany was destined to fail without intense surveillance by the state.
m/kart_racer," It may just be a kid's movie, but in some ways that makes Kart Racer's incredible lack of originality even more of a crime."
m/karthik_calling_karthik, Akhtar's little-boy-lost vulnerable charm holds it all together.
m/kassim_the_dream_2009," Kassim Ouma has, to say the least, an unusual life story....The filmmaker Kief Davidson recounts this vivid tale in the dull documentary."
m/kat_and_the_band, This film is about as accurate a reflection of how people break into the music business as In the Night Garden is about temperate-zone forest habitats.
m/kate_and_leopold, Flies on the sweet chemistry of Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman.
m/katie_says_goodbye, Wayne Roberts' powerfully low-key drama gets under the skin.
m/katt_williams_great_america," This is a man who once retired from stand-up only to mount a comeback three days later. He reliably keeps you on your toes, and many, many, many people can attest to it."
m/katy_perry_part_of_me," Perry, who is part of an era of artists who aim to please their fans first and foremost, goes out on a limb with this film. Ultimately, Part of Me is for fans, but it should have interest for people interested in celebrity culture."
m/kazaam," It's full of special effects that are big on smoke and noise, but short on logic and payoff. Scenes are sloppily edited, as if to imply that lower standards can acceptably be palmed off on kiddie audiences."
m/keane, Mr. Kerrigan both gives us a life at the edge of the abyss and pulls off an extremely deft narrative sleight of hand.
m/keanu_2016, It will delight the show's fans while winning over others unlucky enough never to have seen [Key & Peele].
m/kedi_2017," We're down on the ground with these animals, whose day-to-day impulsiveness finds a sinuous expression in some of the most elegant camerawork to ever grace a nature doc."
m/kedma, Gitai has made a quirky film about the origins of the state of Israel that provides insights into the source of present day Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
m/keep," Directed by Michael Mann. Starring Ian McKellan, Gabriel Byrne and Scott Glenn. Sounds good, right?"
m/keep-your-right-up, Offers pleasure as well as frustration and engages even as it baffles.
m/keep_on_keepin_on," A dig through [Clark] Terry's 2011 autobiography would be more instructive, but this still does the trick."
m/keep_the_lights_on," Bless [Sachs] for eschewing melodrama in favor of tenderness, but his characters are often left adrift in a sea of conflicting emotions."
m/keep_the_river_on_your_right," The [directors)...betray him, condescendingly and manipulatively making it all turn on one relatively unimportant bite of flesh."
m/keeping_the_faith," The movie slides by nicely, giving us larger-than-life characters navigating through ridiculous situations toward the mandatory happy ending. What more can we ask from a romantic comedy?"
m/keeping_up_with_the_joneses, The film is just...bad. There's no other way to put it.
m/keeping_up_with_the_steins," If its ribbing lacks teeth, it's also 100 percent free of spite and snooty meanness."
m/kelly_and_cal_2014," The presence of [Juliette] Lewis makes it feel like a bigger, more important movie than it would've without her"
m/kellys_heroes," Unclear notions of heroism and crime ... packaged as escapist, mainstream entertainment"
m/ken_jeong_you_complete_me_ho, What happens when a doctor who's funny decides to go all in on the funny? We find out in Jeong's first stand-up special.
m/kentuckian," The Kentuckian, though its plot is almost tenuous and its action slight, is a long and ambitious kind of Western."
m/kentucky_fried_movie," It's surprising, then, that The Kentucky Fried Movie can still inspire laughter at its naughtiness, and even more surprising that it might still be considered envelope-pushing."
m/keplers_dream," This family-friendly drama may be inspired by a 17th-century book of the same name by the visionary astronomer, but the movie ""Kepler's Dream"" lacks imagination."
m/kes," Unforgettable when it first appeared 30 years ago, Kes remains something of a landmark."
m/kevin_hart_irresponsible, It's funny! But it leaves you a little annoyed that you never got to the part where you and Hart get to ride the coaster for real.
m/kevin_hart_laugh_at_my_pain, Brace yourself to laugh as much at the irreverent funnyman's profane language as at his pain!
m/kevin_hart_let_me_explain, You know he's still humble enough to remember where he came from when tears can be seen streaming down his face as he takes bows at Madison Square Garden.
m/kevin_hart_what_now, Hart's exuberance make him a captivating performer-and his energetic delivery helps even the most mediocre jokes land.
m/key_largo, The script prepared by Mr. Huston and Richard Brooks was too full of words and highly cross-purposed implications to give the action full chance.
m/keyhole_2012, It was a dark and stormy night. What? You've heard that one before? Not the way Canuck director Guy Maddin tells it in his mind-bending black-and-white psychosexual melodrama.
m/khodorkovsky," The visually snazzy film has stark, ominous, mostly black-and-white computer-animated sequences depicting Mr. Khodorkovsky's initial arrest."
m/khumba," Real-life nature is presented as more exotic, detailed and deeply felt than any fantasy world."
m/khyi_rgan," While the rigid framing and wispy plot create an unfortunate inertia, they also magnify the occasional whimsical moment ..."
m/kick_ass_2_2013," A fun if sporadically schizoid return to one of the brighter, brasher comic-bookers of recent years. Now, about that Hit Girl spin-off..."
m/kickboxer_retaliation," Comes the closest to recapturing the wide-eyed, bone-crunching fun of the 1989 hit, inching away from darkness to reclaim the brand name with a lively offering of bodily harm."
m/kickboxer_vengeance," ""Vengeance"" is well-crafted good fun - and good proof that you don't need more than two hours or $100 million to give ticket buyers their money's worth in popcorn thrills."
m/kicking_and_screaming, What could have been a third-rate knockoff of The Bad News Bears instead emerges as just about its equal.
m/kicking_it," A well-meaning look at the Homeless World Cup, Kicking It presents its topic without much sentimentality, though it could benefit from a more pared-down approach."
m/kicks_2016," If the movie is over-reliant on slo-mo, voiceover and almost wall-to-wall music to drive scenes, its silky blend of lyricism with urban grit marks it as a promising debut."
m/kid_cannabis, Nate comes across as an insufferably arrogant twerp stupid enough to believe there's loyalty in the underworld.
m/kid_in_king_arthurs_court, The ragtag adaptation by Michael Part and Robert Levy is familiar fodder run through a blender too high and too fast.
m/kid_stays_in_the_picture, It's the kind of documentary that doesn't get nominated for awards because it's too entertaining.
m/kidnap_2017," At least there's Halle Berry in the driver's seat, and the force of her performance is enough to push to make this a half-decent recommendation for someone looking for a quickie genre thriller."
m/kidnapped_2011, Relies on the nerve-wracking effect of women's screams and hysterical sobbing for tension...an exercise in audience torture more than anything else.
m/kidnapping_mr_heineken," Anthony Hopkins plays the king of the hops, and he is excellent. So is the rest of the movie, a sober, no-frills account about the highest ransom ever collected up to that time-$10 million and counting."
m/kids_for_cash," A nightmarish and heart-wrenching documentary about fear, paranoia. greed, and an indictment of the juvenile justice system."
m/kika," A riot of colors, Kika is sometimes sick, sometimes playful, but consistently hilarious and entertaining in ways that few films have been lately."
m/kiki_2017," It's an ultimately uplifting film and one that doesn't patronise or placate: the ballroom is shown for what it is, complex, flamboyant and a place to express yourself."
m/kikis_delivery_service," It's a delightful tale of a young witch coming of age, learning to recognize her own talents, and striving to serve her community."
m/kikujiro," ... the movie's humor is dissipated by its slow pace and static scenes, and its emotional payoff is assumed rather than earned."
m/kilimanjaro_to_the_roof_of_africa, This Big Movie leaves no doubt that Mount Kilimanjaro is a truly amazing place.
m/kill_bill_vol_1," Kill Bill may have little on its mind besides pop extravagance, yet you can feel the movie tracing a transition in the world -- from West to East, from male to female rule."
m/kill_bill_volume_2," A beautiful, twisted, complex martial arts soap opera."
m/kill_command," Gamers will have a bit of deja vu watching this, but it is a well managed movie with some cool, controlled performances among the detonations."
m/kill_list_2011," Even with a predictable final twist, this is the most terrifying and audacious British horror film in years."
m/kill_me_three_times, An Aussie crime caper that's full of familiar faces plays a familiar humdrum tune. And also an atrocious score.
m/kill_order," So long as you ignore the plot, this one is filled with mindless action fun."
m/kill_switch_2017," Similar to HARDCORE HENRY, in that it's like watching someone else play a video game for ninety minutes."
m/kill_the_irishman, True-life crime drama about the rise and fall of '70s Cleveland mobster kingpin Danny Greene proves there's life in one of cinema's most venerable genres.
m/kill_the_messenger_2015," To use the parlance of journalism, Kill the Messenger buries the lede ..."
m/kill_the_monsters," The film is skilfully shot in black and white, and inventively edited and performed."
m/kill_the_poor, This lukewarm riff on gentrification and its discontents resurrects the low life and tough times of Alphabet City in the early 1980's.
m/kill_your_darlings_2013," Kill Your Darlings may be best described as an intellectual moral maze, a story perfectly of its time and yet one that still resonates today."
m/kill_your_friends," It's as if Niven fears any glimpse of humanity might risk the project's integrity, but the lack of human empathy ultimately becomes this project's biggest handicap."
m/kill_zone_2_2016," An exemplary showcase of gritty, no-holds-barred action filmmaking."
m/killer_bees_2018," Engaging and humane storytelling that uses the drama of basketball to tell a deeper story about race, class, and the excitement and heartache of young lives careening toward adulthood."
m/killer_elite_2011," While the idea of having three fine actors in an action movie together is certainly promising, Killer Elite proves that it doesn't really matter who you cast if the filmmaking is just more of the same old choppily edited, noisy action crap."
m/killer_is_loose," Handed a narrative stuffed with cat-and-mouse violence, the filmmaker plays down dark hysteria in favor of grayish curtness, and the film is no less tense for that."
m/killer_joe, These are easily the two best pictures the filmmaker has made since his early-'70s heyday; he'd be wise to continue hitching his wagon to this particular writer.
m/killer_kate," Slow, silly and toneless sum up the final product, though with some sharpening and polish Feld could hit his stride as a storyteller and I hope he does."
m/killer_klowns_from_outer_space," This krazy, kooky movie strings together the creature feature with the alien movie, and pumps it full of dark humour"
m/killer_me," It's a remarkable portrait of a man breaking down and fighting for human dignity, and is filmed without any gimmicks or unnecessary distractions."
m/killer_shrews," The film's pre-credit voiceover is laughable, and the opening lines of dialogue not much better, but I don't think it deserves its much-maligned reputation"
m/killerman," An exhilarating, audacious crime thriller, provided you go along with the ride."
m/killers_2010," The mismatch isn't quite of Justin Bieber-Charlize Theron proportions, but Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl play an oddly disjointed pair of lovers, partners and reluctant assassins in Killers."
m/killers_2015," ""Killers"" has plenty to offer genre fans - provided they don't bolt during its opening scene of a tied-up woman being beaten to death with a mallet ..."
m/killers_anonymous," A truly execrable dirge that fails to satisfy a single element of coherent contemporary film-making, except, perhaps, for the initial one-line pitch."
m/killers_kiss, Offers some glimpses of what [Kubrick] was capable of doing with no budget and no crew and no actors.
m/killing," Stanley Kubrick's masterful manipulation of chronology brings an excruciating sense of doom to The Killing, a classical noir about a carefully threaded heist unraveled by the scheming of a fiendish femme."
m/killing_bono_2010, I've not been this disappointed by a movie's title since that Penelope Cruz film Blow turned out to be about a drug dealer.
m/killing_fields," The Killing Fields (1984) is based upon a true story, and follows the historical events surrounding the US evacuation from Vietnam in 1975."
m/killing_ground_2017," Killing Ground is a lot more polished than the raw original Wolf Creek but captures the same intense, unforgiving violence."
m/killing_gunther, Killing Gunther is an astonishingly unfunny film considering the level of sheer comedic talent involved in it. Its lack of energy or character development keeps the film from ever finding its groove.
m/killing_kennedy, Killing Kennedy deserves some credit for attempting to retell the JFK assassination in a slightly different way but it doesn't go far enough in getting at the underpinnings of Oswald's character and motivation.
m/killing_me_softly," Nothing about the story hangs together, the characters become increasingly stiff and unbelievable, and the incessant red herrings finally become too much to bear."
m/killing_them_safely_2015," Therein lies Berardini's critique: using naught but his subjects' own words, he paints a portrait of men who have been dazzled by profits at the expense of their ethics."
m/killing_them_softly," Dominik's aim for allegory of American capitalism is not effective: What elevate his tale above its routine plot are the cynical dialogue, nihilistic tone, and Brad Pitt's effortless star turn as a sociopathic hitman."
m/killing_zoe, A gory bloodbath with no redeeming elements whatsoever.
m/killshot, It's ultimately Rourke who makes the film worth watching.
m/kim," Fine later Flynn, pairing him with brilliant child actor Dean Stockwell."
m/kin_2018," Josh and Jonathan Baker's feature length expansion on their acclaimed sci-fi short is big on SFX, but lacks in almost every other department."
m/kind_hearts_and_coronets," Com o tpico humor repleto de cinismo da Ealing, o filme se torna inesquecvel graas tambm s atuaes de Price e Guinness (fantstico como oito personagens diferentes)."
m/kindergarten_cop," hough Schwarzenegger remains to acting what ham hocks are to a cheese course, he manages against all odds to be appealing as the Austrian au pair. Think of it as To Conan With Love."
m/kindergarten_cop_2," This is a bad film, as simple as that. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/king_and_country, Losey creates a chilling sense of mood with nothing more than horrifying still images of a war-torn landscape.
m/king_arthur_legend_of_the_sword, King Arthur could have been a rollicking blast. Instead it's just another wannabe blockbuster with too much flash and not enough soul.
m/king_charles_iii," The movie, like the Broadway show, is performed as a Shakespearean history play. The dialogue is spoken in verse, the scenes are rapid and punchy, and the actors are top-notch."
m/king_cobra_2016," King Cobra is a sleek, darkly humorous, luridly enjoyable exploration of a real-life murder story but beyond its superficial pleasures, it's unlikely to stay with you."
m/king_creole," It's Presley's Danny Fisher in King Creole who is a full-fledged, contradictory human being."
m/king_georges," ""King Georges"" reminds us that a singular dining experience can often be the expression of a very singular personality, singular temperament, singular discipline."
m/king_in_the_wilderness," The film's message remains timely, shaped by the voices and vivid recollections of King's intimate associates in the struggle for equality."
m/king_jack," What elevates this indie film is Boardwalk Empire's Charlie Plummer, with something of the young DiCaprio about him."
m/king_kong," That Jackson's King Kong upgrades the now hammy original with wit, heart and humour is a pleasant surprise. That it does so by reinventing the action blockbuster, in form and emotional impact, is nothing less than an act of cinematic alchemy."
m/king_of_california, Mike Cahill focuses on the magic worth finding between a father and daughter. That's why the film sticks with you. It's a gift.
m/king_of_devils_island_2011," King of Devil's Island hits the familiar plot points most prison films cherish (escape attempts, riots, chase sequences), but Hoist's keen directing abilities prove that worn-out film genres can be advanced with the right casting and setting."
m/king_of_hearts_1967, A really hilarious and very pleasing film that doesn't argue its message with the viewer via corny or ignorant measures.
m/king_of_kong," A hilarious and moving study of the obsessive competition between the all-time scoring leader on Donkey Kong, an odd Floridian, and a father of two who gets sucked into a world of mind-blowing passive-aggressiveness."
m/king_of_marvin_gardens, The King of Marvin Gardens reminds us of the diversity and dynamism of the New Hollywood movement. And how odd it is that a largely forgotten film should feel so utterly unforgettable.
m/king_of_new_york," Given a can't miss genre and a star at the top of the field, Ferrara turns in a big disappointment here"
m/king_of_the_ants_2003," A grimy film, with that griminess amplified by the crummy production value that The Asylum enforced on Stuart Gordon and his crew."
m/king_of_thieves_2019," We can have the joshing banter, the gags about this over-the-hill Lavender Hill Mob, but they come mixed up with the sniping and snarling, the carnivorous nastiness... Bless."
m/kingdom_come, Most of it never rises above the realm of mediocre TV.
m/kingdom_of_heaven," The movie does what any self-respecting politician would do: sidestep the issues, soft-pedal mortal costs, talk a fat game, and divert your attention away from history with exercises in spectacle and power."
m/kingdom_of_us," As a film it is just simply too long, with the last hour lacking structure. With some serious editing this could be an even more powerful documentary."
m/kings_2017," Chaotic, melodramatic, but a vivid impressionist sketch of lives upended or lost in the LA riots."
m/kings_of_pastry_2010," A documentary of this nature cannot provide the drama of a fiction movie, e.g. 'Babette's Feast,' but this is worth seeing if you believe that food should look at least as appealing as it tastes."
m/kings_of_the_evening," An anachronistic rip-off which implies that the idea of male beauty pageants originated with African-Americans in the 1930s, instead of with Zulus in the 1990s. Is the film otherwise worthwhile? Yes, but it still weirded me out."
m/kings_ransom," Less amusing than being bound, gagged, and tortured."
m/kings_row," ...while episodic and sentimental and filled with all kinds of unlikely turns of events, there is no denying the characters are endearing and the ending uplifting."
m/kingsglaive_final_fantasy_xv_2016," Improved animation, but the hash of a story and the myriad of forgettable characters and situations make this more of a video game commercial or primer for players than a movie."
m/kingsman_the_golden_circle," It's still a thrilling ride with action sequences unmatched in their high-velocity blasts, but the new additions struggle to conceal the familiarity beneath this secret service."
m/kingsman_the_secret_service," A startlingly enjoyable and well-made action film leavened by humor and slicked along by style, made by, for, and about people who've seen far too many Bond films."
m/kink_2014," More than just a thorough examination of hardcore pornography, Christina Voros's doc is also a sort of chronicle of the filmmaking process."
m/kinky_boots," Kinky Boots trips on its contrived plot, but this blend of trash and sass is a comfy fit."
m/kinsey, Condon sheds some light on a fascinating and underappreciated man while also delivering a pretty damn entertaining motion picture at the same time.
m/kirk_camerons_saving_christmas," With a smile so wide and laughter that sounds so forced you half-expect the camera to pull back to reveal hostage takers, Mr. Cameron explains how several facets of the holiday - the tree, Santa Claus, gifts - have roots in religious tradition."
m/kis_uykusu," ...Ceylan's film is a monologue and a relentless one, leaving no room for us to interpret or engage with the material he presents."
m/kiss-the-bride, ...one of those rare movies that leaves the viewer wanting more after the credits have rolled...
m/kiss_kiss_bang_bang, Quite a roller-coaster ride through the funhouse of Tough-Guy P.I. Fiction.
m/kiss_me_again, More trashy dialogue like that (and a more favorable nudity-to-sex-scene ratio) could have transformed Kiss Me Again into a guilty pleasure.
m/kiss_me_stupid," In any event, this has to rank as Wilder's most corrosive and despairing portrait of America."
m/kiss_of_the_damned_2012," Decadence and debauchery are equal parts death and creation in a cool little vampire movie that makes the ""Twilight"" franchise look like kid stuff."
m/kiss_of_the_dragon," Don't go expecting the same tired wire-fu we've had jammed down our throats over and over in the past few years. This isn't like that. It's more about the contact, the skin-on-skin fights that even leave bruises on the people in the back of the theater."
m/kiss_of_the_spider_woman, Bold and touching performances by William Hurt and Raul Julia.
m/kiss_of_the_vampire_1963," Some will doubtless argue the point, but Don Sharp's The Kiss of the Vampire (1963) may very well be the best of all the Hammer horror films."
m/kiss_the_bride_2008," Plot contrivances and erratic character choices reduce would could have been a frothy comedy into a confused, unsatisfying jumble that no amount of beefcake can rescue."
m/kiss_the_girls," The tension is genuine and the crimes frightening, though the editing occasionally opts for flashy style over fitting artistry."
m/kiss_the_water_2013," Definitely not your standard doc, this is something special ... a captivating journey through a landscape of mystery and imagination."
m/kissing_jessica_stein," Every once in a while, a movie comes out of nowhere to kick up your spirits."
m/kit_kittredge_an_american_girl," This is the kind of girls' film that the dads out there won't mind taking their daughters to and, I say, will enjoy it as well."
m/kitchen-party1997," It is a story of friendship, family, faith and food, and while it doesn't go in any directions that are new or different the film is still a hugely enjoyable frolic almost impossible not to adore."
m/kitchen_stories," Against all odds, it turns out, everyday life in a Scandinavian kitchen can be quite a show."
m/kite_2014, The teenage assassin thing has become a tired cliche whose creators unconvincingly cite female empowerment to defend this tackiest of fetishes.
m/kite_runner," Nuanced perfs and standout production design convey story in cinematic terms, preserving the narrative's emotional power and historical sweep as it spans continents and decades."
m/kites," Not even the incoherent mish-mash of plot (mostly faux Sergio Leone by way of Tarantino and Rodriguez, with periodic car-flipping chase sequences) can entirely dim the appeal of this match-up."
m/kitty_foyle," Although the movie is unashamedly a soppy chick flick, it's impossible not to be swept along by her romantic dilemmas."
m/klansman," Why Is it that when almost any film is set in the Deep South, normally sane writers, directors, and actors are inspired to lose their wits completely, feel that anything goes, and vie with each other as to who can make the cauldron bubble faster?"
m/klaus," Klaus is designed to break your heart just a little bit. The pain of loss and the fear of change are immensely powerful forces and Pablos doesn't shy away from addressing them, which makes Klaus the most necessary kind of Christmas movie."
m/klitschko," There's enough boxing footage, of course, to satisfy avid fans of the sport, but the brothers' personal history is the real attraction here, with its fascinating revelations about their homeland and culture."
m/klopka-the-trap, Klopka (The Trap) starts off as a fascinating post-Milosevic film noir but ends up somewhere in the land of day-time soap circa 1985.
m/klovn_the_movie," Raunchy dude comedy is hardly the sole province of American cinema, as Klown all too dispiritingly reconfirms."
m/klown_forever, Leave behind your notions that [Klovn Forever] won't broach any topic for a joke.
m/klute," Sutherland is either an excellent sounding board for this nuanced portrait or he's a big zero, probably both. Fonda, however, transcends her limitations, making the most of her often forced quality as an actress."
m/knife_in_the_water, It eminently justifies the interest in its acid contents and in the techniques of its young director that it stirred.
m/knifefight," Cynical and savvy, it's a small film with a big message about the ends justifying the means."
m/knight_and_day," Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action -- and the story itself -- spin ridiculously out of control."
m/knight_of_cups," For every pinch of poetry, there are kilos of joyless, uninspired prose."
m/knightriders, this film shows that Romero has the ability to tell a good tale outside of the realm of the macabre . . . probably the closest Romero has come to producing an epic film
m/knights_of_badassdom," I've been given a palatable taste of Joe Lynch's Knights Of Badassdom, but I'm now ready for the main course - Lynch's fabled Director's Cut."
m/knights_of_the_round_table," The stilted, uptight vibe of the film is pretty much just standard operating procedure for movies of this type and this era."
m/knights_tale," While the film progresses in a conventional manner, there's a quirky and somewhat unique sensibility that keeps emerging."
m/knives_and_skin, It may be the most anarchic and refreshing take on the American teen's existential malaise since Heathers.
m/knives_out," If you are looking for a good time at the movies this holiday season (perhaps searching for a way to escape the family for a few hours), ""Knives Out"" is certainly one you shouldn't miss."
m/knock_down_the_house," What makes Knock Down the House so compelling, though, is that it digs beyond the pretty soundbites and packaged-for-TV narratives to show us not just who and what is happening in American politics right now, but how and why."
m/knock_knock_2015, A taboo thriller that will put Fifty Shades of Grey to shame.
m/knock_off," Bumbles and fumbles its way through a messy plot, advancing from each dreary subplot to the next with no hint of a coherent storyboard."
m/knockaround_guys," The inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise, but the only drama is in waiting to hear how John Malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line."
m/knocked_up," It's not just about growing up, it's the kind of movie that helps you grow up."
m/know_how," Despite a handful of immediately upsetting sequences, DIY hip-hop musical Know How never coheres into a cathartic fictional account of its creators' turbulent adolescence."
m/knowing," Knowing"" is one of those movies that when you get to the lobby, you begin asking yourself or others a lot of questions about why did they do this, or why was that required."
m/knuckle_2011," Director Ian Palmer has constructed a gripping film that offers no simple criticisms or answers, but superbly records a subculture where violence and honour come knuckle-to-knuckle."
m/knuckleball_2012," This chronicle of two athletes throwing baseball's funkiest, least respected pitch is given depth by their stranger-than-fiction underdog status and camaraderie with mentors who've had the same struggles."
m/knucklehead," World Wrestling Entertainment continues its effort to meld violent sport with gooey, throwback family comedy in the claptrap road movie Knucklehead."
m/knute_rockne_all_american, Perhaps Ronald Reagan's greatest talent was his ability to float to the top.
m/koch_2012," A breezy, thoroughly entertaining and balanced doc that sheds light on Ed Koch's panache, wisdom and sense of humor behind the curtain of politics."
m/kodachrome_2018, Simultaneously a tribute to a seemingly bygone era and an affirmation of the sometimes unexpected resilience of father-son bonds.
m/koi-mil-gaya-i-found-someone," Ultimately, it's a Hollywood science fiction plot wrapped around a traditional boy-meets-girl Bollywood core, and the song-and-dance numbers are for the most part merely serviceable."
m/kolobos," Kolobos isn't a great movie by any stretch, but it's a fun relic from the not-too-distant past and accurately represents a tumultuous time for the horror genre."
m/kolya," With his big sad eyes, Andrej Chalimon pulls us lovingly and completely into Kolya's life. He's simply perfect as a little Russian refugee in this poignant movie treasure."
m/kon_tiki_2012," If you're in need of a couple of bursts of all-over goosebumps, Kon-Tiki is your surest bet at the moment."
m/kong_skull_island, It understands the appeal of these movies as a reminder of humanity's relative insignificance in the face of horrors it can't possibly comprehend.
m/kontroll," In this mature and delicate debut, Antal leaves eough of his film open-ended to give room for thinking."
m/korengal," As a record of the war, the two films are imperishable."
m/korkoro, Robust emotion and cultural detail offset slight plotting and characterizations.
m/koyaanisqatsi_life_out_of_balance," gets its point across through Phillip Glass' hypnotic and evocative score, cinematographer Ron Fricke's creative and provocative juxtapositions, and mystical forces"
m/kpax," Kevin Spacey in his least edgy role in a routine, derivative film that lacks internal logic."
m/kramer_vs_kramer," In confronting marriage break-up and its impact on children, [it] still provides an outlet for audiences to relate to these difficult issues, which is still a wonderful thing."
m/krampus," It's difficult to imagine any children over the age of, say, 10 being scared by this movie. (The resentment of grownups talked into accompanying them to see it is easier to envision.)"
m/krays," Occasionally successful, but not Peter Medak at his best."
m/kreutzer_sonata," Bold, brilliant and exhilarating: an intimately horrible, sexually explicit and black-comic portrait of a toxic marriage."
m/kriemhilds_revenge," With its overabundance of slow motion and overly written subtitles, it would be a better picture if cut to 15 or 20 minutes. The battle stuff, in short subject form, would make it playable."
m/krippendorfs_tribe," in terms of raunchiness and innuendo, 'Tribe' turns out to be almost as ribald as an 'Inside Edition' report on Monica Lewinsky. Jokes about menstruation, circumcision, penis size and prehistorical marital aids are sprinkled liberally throughout..."
m/kris-crisis, Crude by the director's later standards but still an interesting melodrama into which he poured many of his early ideas.
m/kronks_new_groove," If its characters, music, and action seem to an adult less than inspired, that's the price one pays for watching a straight-to-video sequel."
m/krrish," Bollywood through and through, but a noble and innovative attempt at a typically alien genre."
m/krrish_3," A tighter third act would have helped, with one too many teary farewells and resurrected bad-guys bulking up the finale. Naturally, such issues won't bother the under-12s, for whom this old-fashioned, energetic matinee malarkey is clearly aimed."
m/krull," It contains some interesting concepts, but it has a remarkably difficult time not appearing entirely derivative of other works."
m/krush_groove," Made in the mid-80s as a cash-in on the hip-hop explosion, the movie plays better now than it did then"
m/krystal," These shenanigans might be amusing if they came with consequences, but big things happen, only to be forgiven or forgotten by the following scene."
m/kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016," This is Laika's brightest film to date, in both its dazzling colors and its core of irrepressible joy."
m/kuffs, All involved could do better. An interesting curiosity only for diehard Milla Jovovich fans.
m/kull_the_conqueror," Just another routine sword-and-sandals action yarn, of the kind that fell out of fashion some years ago."
m/kumare, Kumar has a premise that could've been the launching point for one of Sascha Baron Cohen and Larry Charles's satirical outrages.
m/kumiko_the_treasure_hunter," A work of rigorously disciplined eccentricity, Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter is at once entirely accessible and yet appealing only to a rarified crowd ready to key into its narrow-bandwidth sense of humor."
m/kung_fu_hustle, The supreme battles are brushed away by the ultimate battles and the ultimate battles are pushed aside by even more absolute battles.
m/kung_fu_killer_2015, Some of the fight scenes are dazzling in their speed and complexity.
m/kung_fu_panda," The colorful locale and battles, not the message, are the thing in this hybrid of family fare and martial arts in which Jack Black is too cute as the chubby misfit-hero but it's Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane who steal the show with their ironic delivery"
m/kung_fu_panda_3," He's just a Po boy, from a Po family, who must spare him his life from that monstrosity."
m/kung_fu_panda_the_kaboom_of_doom," A precisely calibrated crowd-pleasing machine, balancing action, comedy and just the bare minimum of pathos."
m/kung_fu_yoga," The globetrotting adventure yarn extensively, and energetically, riffs on Indiana Jones's signature moments. You'll wish that its storytelling polish matched its enthusiasm."
m/kung_pow," Unless you're as huge a fan of martial-arts classics as Oedekerk, this really long joke about continuity errors and bad voice-overs is simply kung P.U."
m/kurt_and_courtney," In all of Broomfield's films, you meet people you can hardly believe exist."
m/kurt_cobain_about_a_son," A touching, heartbreaking and an ultimately honest personal experience. But when all is said and done, all that is really there is the complexity of Kurt Cobain, explained as only the man himself could."
m/kurt_cobain_montage_of_heck_2015, The definitive Cobain documentary. There is nowhere else to go from here.
m/kwaidan," The first episode builds an effective mood through its elliptical action and long, slow tracks through empty rooms, but this 1965 film soon levels off into academic stylization."
m/kwik_stop," This is the debut feature for Columbia College graduate Gilio, and it shows great promise."
m/kyun_ho_gaya_na," There is much to enjoy in this romantic comedy, especially real life lovers Oberoi and Rai who bring a certain camp charm to the breezy proceedings."
m/l-aveu-the-confession," The structure becomes complex but never confusing, and Costa-Gavras always seems to be urgently on the move, wanting to tell us more than can be told."
m/l-iceberg," The film is a series of tableaus and gags that may indeed work by themselves but, when cemented together, creates lots of dead air."
m/la-doppia-ora," Suffice it to say that the twists and turns in The Double Hour are not arbitrary; rather, they are well considered and effective, right down to the last frame."
m/la_bamba," Good entertainment even if before the film, like me, you couldn't reliably name a single one of Valens's hits."
m/la_belle_endormie," Judging from The Sleeping Beauty, and the previous Bluebeard, the provocations stop with the choice of the material, as the tone and style of these films are jarringly well-behaved."
m/la_belle_noiseuse," Some movies are worlds that we can sink into, and La Belle Noiseuse is one of them."
m/la_bete_humaine, Features one of Jean Gabin's greatest performances -- one with even more force than the locomotive he powers.
m/la_cage_aux_folles, This adaptation of Jean Poiret's play is as moving as it is hilarious in its depiction of moral hypocrisy and familial love.
m/la_chambre_bleue," [Amalric's] latest effort, The Blue Room (La Chambre bleue), takes a cue from both classic Hollywood noir and the time-shuffling narratives of the late Alain Resnais, telling a familiar story in ways that can feel compellingly new."
m/la_chevre, A funny French film filled with plenty of slapstick comedy.
m/la_chinoise," It's shocking to see Godard bite the hand that admires him, but this is what makes the movie relevant and timeless."
m/la_cienaga," Seems designed only to shock and depress, a film devoid of much insight or humanity."
m/la_confidential," There wasn't a moment where I wasn't amazed, bowled over by its greatness. This film just shows that one can still do noir and make it non-Tarantino-esque."
m/la_dame_dans_lauto_avec_un_fusil_et_des_lunettes," Director Joann Sfar (Gainsbourg) is far more interested in the hazy, overheated world through which his eponymous protagonist wanders. And when the film lets her do that, it's fun to drift along in her wake."
m/la_delicatesse, Tautou is fine but clearly typecast as another whimsical pixie with strong melancholy undercurrents.
m/la_fee," In their third feature, gifted physical comedians Abel, Gordon and Romy gracefully build on their distinctive brand of burlesque humour."
m/la_femme_nikita," [Besson] seems to like playing off the generic, though he probably thinks of it as working with the mythic, the classic."
m/la_france," Without ever surrendering its deadpan naturalism, La France becomes increasingly poetic: The seasons change, the landscape grows barren, and the stars in the sky take their names from the dead men below."
m/la_grande_illusion, It's a marvelous introduction to the work of one of the top masters of the cinema.
m/la_haine," All the performances are excellent, especially Cassel..."
m/la_la_land, A gorgeous romantic fever dream of a movie musical. La La Land is one for this age - and the ages. Stunning in every way.
m/la_leyenda_del_chupacabras, Fourth movie in Spanish-language series has scary parts.
m/la_mujer_de_mi_hermano, A vapid slab of soap depicting a love triangle among three remarkably uninteresting characters.
m/la_petite_lili," A work of whimsy, passion, visual lushness and no small degree of warmth for its characters."
m/la_princesse_de_montpensier," [VIDEO] ""The Princess of Montpensier"" is a lavish, French period drama full of dynamic sword fights and ill-concealed emotions. It is a rare cinematic treat."
m/la_promesse," A troubling, offbeat and somewhat downbeat drama with no easy answers, with a stark, realistic style and some very good performances."
m/la_religieuse_2013," Though Etienne and Huppert are fantastic, Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel is neither nunsploitation nor chamber piece, just about working as a sermon on hypocrisy."
m/la_sapienza," Eugne Green's mannered direction doesn't work for every situation it's homogenously applied to, but at its most effective it inspires an enhanced sensitivity to the import of every gesture, visual or verbal."
m/la_sierra, This courageous documentary takes viewers to a small hillside community in Medellín where an illegal right-wing paramilitary group holds power.
m/la_slasher," It inflates the meta conceit (already borderline overblown) of a pop-obsessed, sex-negative serial killer to excessive but trite proportions."
m/la_story, So funny that I could not control myself at times -- one belly laugh would not subside before another began.
m/la_terra_trema, Visconti used real Sicilian fishermen as non-actors expressing their circumstances and beliefs. The effect is a powerful portrait of graceful human dignity caught between the cruelty of the sea and opportunistic greed.
m/la_tete_en_friche," There is a sweet chemistry between Depardieu and Casadesus, but their wry interactions are lost within a rambling, frothy non-story that aims squarely for the heart over the head."
m/la_vie_en_rose, Marion Cotillard gives the performance of a lifetime in Olivier Dahan's fascinating but uneven Edith Piaf biopic La môme (La Vie en Rose).
m/labor_day_2013," A nuanced, superbly acted love story with a most unusual genesis."
m/labyrinth, That the whole mess of Labyrinth was entertaining once to a child is a precarious gauge of quality.
m/ladder_49," The further Ladder gets into the story of Jack's past, the deeper we care about his uncertain present."
m/ladies_and_gentlemen_the_fabulous_stains," Nancy Dowd's blueprint has scrappy traces of The Girl Can't Help It (and the seeds of Madonna, Courtney, Britney...), Lou Adler's direction has an exhausted band wrangler's acquaintance with waves and fads."
m/ladies_in_black, Ladies in Black may be seen mistakenly as lightweight or slight; it isn't. It brims with subtext and nuance and at the same time succeeds in being a thoroughly enjoyable entertainment.
m/ladies_in_lavender, The two thespian lovelies would enchant just reading the phone book.
m/ladron_que_roba_a_ladron_2007," The movie is primarily about fantasy, and everything is exaggerated to such a degree that you play along."
m/lady_and_the_tramp," Visual images on a 70mm screen are bound to be stunning, but it takes a fun and good-natured story to back them up; here, we have a premise that joins two opposites in a sweet love story as adventurous as it is fearsome and daring."
m/lady_and_the_tramp_ii_scamps_adventure, Made without much of the original Lady and the Tramp's spirit in mind.
m/lady_bird," Snappy, spirited and shot through with the pangs and pleasures of leaving childhood behind, Lady Bird is a sharp-witted solo first feature by actress and now writer-director Greta Gerwig."
m/lady_eve," The Lady Eve (1941) is a sophisticated romantic/sex comedy (with light romance and mock seduction scenes) - a classic screwball film,"
m/lady_in_the_water," This misbegotten project is Shyamalan's weakest thriller--senseless, verbose, convoluted. It might be remembered for featuring the director himself as a wannabe writer, and a film critic from hell who complains, there are no original stories left..."
m/lady_in_white," Lady in White tells a classic ghost story in such an everyday way that the ghost is almost believable, and the story is actually scarier than it might have been with a more gruesome approach."
m/lady_j, A pleasurable way indeed to pass two hours at the cinema.
m/lady_l," A silly, forgettable sex comedy that is a star vehicle for Sophia Loren."
m/lady_macbeth," Despite William Oldroyd's formidable direction, his perspective on the material, as well as his point of empathy, wavers."
m/lady_on_a_train," A delightful thriller unusual in that it's loaded with laughs, having been written by Beloin and O'Brien, who churned out the scripts for Jack Benny's radio shows. Durbin is charming and turns in a superb performance."
m/lady_snowblood, a film of rich texture and beauty that combines all manner of gonzo artistry from both stage and screen
m/ladyhawke," Concerning the removal of a certain diabolical curse which keeps two lovers always together, yet always apart, Ladyhawke is a successful, unpretentious little film that uses strong characterization rather than special effects to achieve its goals."
m/ladykillers, Hanks' first comic performance in more than a decade (and one of the best performances of his career).
m/ladyworld," Pondering the savage nature of teenage girls, Ladyworld maintains that it's always more beneficial for them to band together than to tear each other apart."
m/lagaan_once_upon_a_time_in_india," A lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn."
m/lagerfeld_confidential," ""I'm a complete improvisation,"" Lagerfeld declares. And it's quite a performance."
m/laggies, Keira Knightley gives a delightfully loose-limbed performance in Lynn Shelton's polished sixth feature.
m/lair_of_the_white_worm," More pantomime than horror, Ken Russell's unsurprisingly outrageous romp exposes conflicting substrates of British identity."
m/lake_city," Quaintly shot and paced, not unlike Shotgun Stories, but insanely over-written, Lake City dumps on audiences a plot that consists of 500-some-odd puzzle pieces that all come together exactly as you expect."
m/lake_house," A supernatural romantic melodrama in the vein of Ghost, though not as trashily enjoyable or charmingly sexy, this enigmatic movie, a remake of a mediocre Korean meller, reteams Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since Speed."
m/lake_michigan_monster, Destined to be one of the weirdest films that anybody will see this year.
m/lake_of_fire, Lives up to its promise of definitiveness...a significant piece of journalism.
m/lake_placid," Where ""Godzilla"" makes the head hurt, ""Placid"" splashes up a bit fun. A solid ""B"" movie."
m/lake_tahoe," A simply complex, intelligent and quietly absorbing drama with just the right blend of humor, tenderness and cinma vrit realism."
m/lakeboat," I once taught a class on Mamet's films. I wish I could have opened it with this one, because for Mamet, it all starts here."
m/lamb_2016," A provocative, dangerous tale that gets to real emotion because it doesn't play it safe."
m/lambert_and_stamp, The rare truthful and beautiful film about the rock 'n' roll life.
m/land_ho," Sublimely enjoyable, but never digs deep enough to give itself much weight."
m/land_of_mine, This well-made drama borrows a little-known sliver of history concerning Denmark's post-war mistreatment of young German POWs forced to defuse and extract land mines.
m/land_of_silence_and_darkness_1971, Land of Silence and Darkness is a tremendous testament to the strength of the human spirit...Werner Herzog is a filmmaker of substantive skill and talent.
m/land_of_the_dead, The latest installment could well be Romero's masterpiece.
m/landline," Great movie bickering becomes a kind of music, but well before the end of ""Landline,"" I just wanted the characters to cease their ranting and storming, or at least lower the volume."
m/lansdown, A very promising first effort by writer/director Tom Zuber and his first-time cast and crew.
m/lansky," After so many Cosa Nostrums out of Hollywood tending to suggest that however violent, mobsters are also cute -- picking up tips from previous films on how to patter and swag; doing the Tarantino -- it's a relief to hear them in their brute banality."
m/lantana," A strong, consistently engrossing drama that boils with emotions distinctly real and recognizable."
m/lara_croft_tomb_raider," When it comes to the action scenes, West is all thumbs. His camera always seems to be in the wrong place, and the scenes never build momentum."
m/lara_croft_tomb_raider_the_cradle_of_life," If ever there was a movie fit for permanent entombment, it's this sequel."
m/laramie_project," A fascinating chorus of outrage and sadness, hatred and hope."
m/largent, This unique and meticulous work of art makes a fitting swansong for a cinematic genius.
m/larger_than_life, It's hard watching a comic of Bill Murray's talents get upstaged by a bored-looking elephant.
m/larnacoeur," An American remake is already on the cards, though it's hard to see how it could improve on the original -- sparkling, elegant and wafer-light, if you could bottle rom-com, it would taste like this."
m/larry_crowne, Hanks fans will revel in their hero's hour in this innocuous tale that's well intentioned for all its mediocre happenings and foreseeable ending.
m/larry_the_cable_guy_health_inspector, Envision what food poisoning does to a gastrointestinal tract. Now think of that substance as fodder for the lowest aiming standup act in America.
m/lassie," Lassie is a thoroughly enjoyable family film of the sort that they really don't make anymore. However, be warned, if you take young children to see this you may find yourself getting a border collie for Christmas."
m/lassie_come_home, This was understandably inspiring to wartime audiences and actually still holds up as a heartwarming story with a very decent cast.
m/lasso," It runs a little long at 97 minutes, but there are enough smart moments to deserve a careful consideration. This is director Evan Cecil's feature debut. Respect."
m/last_action_hero," Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy and adult shoot'em-up, Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns, doesn't completely bowl you over, it's clever and intriguing."
m/last_airbender," Nothing short of an incomprehensible fiasco. If one must go see it, avoid the 3-D version like the bubonic plague."
m/last_boy_scout," Strictly for viewers who don't want surprises, just a laundry list of buddyisms."
m/last_call_at_the_oasis, Both an informative bit of agitprop and an ultra slick and slightly self-satisfied bit of entertainment.
m/last_castle, Making every single murderer and rapist into a sympathetic character is going way too far.
m/last_chance_harvey, Writer/director Joel Hopkins is smart enough to focus entirely on the two lead actors and there is enough veracity in their seasoned faces to keep the drama comfortably on track.
m/last_day_of_summer-2009," Had a chance to be a decent movie, but Vlad Yudin, who directed and wrote it, couldn't resist a potty joke. A long, grating potty joke."
m/last_days," For three films now, Van Sant has been hard-selling a form of cinema absentia, where the action that transpires offscreen is as important as what happens inside the frame."
m/last_days_here_2011, An affectionate look at a self-destructing maniac and his supporters that bluntly reveals Liebling's total abjection without mocking him.
m/last_days_in_the_desert," If ""Last Days in the Desert"" was just an empty vessel, it would be worth watching because it's so beautifully shot and so well acted. But it's rich with both ideas and empathy."
m/last_days_in_vietnam," ""Last Days in Vietnam"" combines astonishing footage from April 1975 with the contemporary recollections of some who were there."
m/last_days_of_disco," Even the most promising characters turn out to be shallow and often hateful, their stories meander interminably."
m/last_detail," The Last Detail is one superbly funny, uproariously intelligent performance, + two others that are very, very good, which are so effectively surrounded by profound bleakness that it seems to be a new kind of anti-comedy."
m/last_emperor," The best I can say for it is that it is a smart epic, and I think it will age very well."
m/last_exorcism, As taut and economical a horror film as I've seen in a long time...a gripping little movie that will give you the willies.
m/last_flag_flying," Four powerhouse performances cannot quite make Richard Linklater's occasionally moving dramedy, Last Flag Flying, into more than a minor war movie."
m/last_flight_of_noahs_ark," Parents know Disney movies are OK to send the kids to because there won't be any nudity or profanity. But isn't it also poisonous for kids to be exposed to stupid characters, lame-brained plots and humorless 'gags?'"
m/last_hijack, The filmmakers have gotten extraordinary access to Mohamed and ravaged Somalia.
m/last_holiday, Simple and modest in structure but delightfully rich in character.
m/last_holiday_2006, Latifah ensures that Last Holiday is often very charming and never less than pleasant.
m/last_house_on_the_left, A cinematic masterpiece; an astonishing achievement; a landmark of horror that reaches into our deepest fears.
m/last_hurrah, Ford has done all this once... But the poetry is gone.
m/last_king_of_scotland, The film is phenomenally well directed by Kevin Macdonald and edited by Justine Wright to bring out every bit of scary volatility in the most casual interactions.
m/last_kiss," What happens in The Last Kiss may be a pitfall of translation: A European movie in which unhappiness reigns usually employs enough sense of the absurd to make it all palatable. Here, it's just unremittingly sad."
m/last_knights," Another macho celebration of fighting for ""freedom"" because someone else told you to, devoid of any acknowledgement of the inherent irony of that ideology."
m/last_legion," A depressing pageant of bad dialogue, uninspired sword fights, corny getaways, and loads of completely unintentional sexual innuendo."
m/last_love, Conventional drama about an ex-pat retired American professor mourning his beloved wife's passing benefits from always watchable star Michael Caine. But widespread web availability and familiar treatment of material...will spell mild box office.
m/last_man_standing, A Walter Hill classic with super cool Bruce Willis.
m/last_men_in_aleppo, May be one of this year's most important and significant documentaries.
m/last_mogul," In death as in life, Wasserman proves a subject of total fascination."
m/last_of_sheila," The Last of Sheila is a crackerjack brainteaser, even if you forget it two minutes after you see it."
m/last_of_the_red_hot_lovers," [It] was a very funny thing on stage, but with serious overtones. On film Simon's lines have just as much wit, just as much fun and just as much bite. But... The hero's anguish seems to overshadow his fumbling attempts at being a Casanova."
m/last_ounce_of_courage," This is bigotry masquerading as leadership, thuggery claiming the banner of freedom, braggadocio pretending to be strength."
m/last_passenger," Instead of submitting entirely to formula, the movie attempts something seldom seen on the screen, trying to make the idea of a monster more frightening than the constant demands of one."
m/last_picture_show," doesn't shy away from the inherent awkwardness of life, but instead embraces it with an elegiac sensitivity that sidesteps Peyton Place-style melodrama and turns small-town anomie and the dead ends of life into stark cinematic poetry"
m/last_rampage," Although Last Rampage's overarching narrative travels a well-tread road, it strikes a number of potent grace notes along the way."
m/last_samurai," Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise deliver an energetic and compelling film in Last Samurai. It's not a thematically original film, but it's great holiday fare."
m/last_sin_eater," Efforts to build suspense, with ominous music and dark figures flashing past the camera, are laughably amateurish, as is the made-for-TV cinematography."
m/last_stand_2013," For a movie that advertises itself as a movie starring Arnold Swarzenegger, he sure spends a lot of time off-screen."
m/last_station," Helen Mirren's stunning performance centers this story of Tolstoy's last year, equally about love and politics."
m/last_tango_in_paris," Brando gives his all but just ends up becoming himself. Interesting for its historical notoriety, but overlong and dull in places."
m/last_temptation_of_christ, There are too many epic moments and impassioned performances to dismiss Scorsese's work.
m/last_train_from_gun_hill," Western stressing suspense, with some vivid characters and conversations."
m/last_train_home-2009," Helmed by Fan Lixin, who also takes credits as d.p. and co-editor, the pic laudably adopts an intimate, personal approach to a subject -- hardworking Chinese garment workers -- that's been covered in more hectoring fashion elsewhere."
m/last_tycoon," Elia Kazan now admits that he directed this adaptation, his last Hollywood film, for the money. Unfortunately, it looks it."
m/last_unicorn, Would the act of giving The Last Unicorn an average rating be tantamount to kicking a puppy?
m/last_vegas_2013, A royal flush of actors delivers a winning hand for this likable seriocomedy.
m/last_voyage," It's great on raising the level of tension, and its special effects and unique filming style are also great."
m/last_wave," An interesting mixture of dreams and reality, of occult Aborigine tribal rituals and of modern-day Sydney."
m/last_weekend," Last Weekend is too enamored of this nouveau riche household to be satirical, instead offering unexpected moments of genuine warmth as a calling card for goodness."
m/last_winter, ...a talky indie that suddenly turns into a slasher flick where the killer is in fact the invisible hand of Mother Nature
m/last_year_at_marienbad," Cold and aloof, this is also a strangely haunting movie experience."
m/latalante," There is much playfulness and poetry, such visual riches."
m/late_for_dinner," After spinning its wheels for an hour with unnecessary exposition, Late for Dinner never really develops the emotional material we've been waiting for."
m/late_marriage," Late Marriage seems, like its protagonist, lost in a sea of its own ambivalence."
m/late_phases_2014," Late Phases transforms from laughably non-frightening horror film to self-serious family drama and back again, all the while remaining ferociously, ravenously boring."
m/late_show, The Late Show is a detective flick that modestly delivers more than one expects.
m/latter_days," This sitcom setup is as bad as it sounds, and Cox never really surmounts it."
m/laugh_killer_laugh," ""Laugh Killer Laugh"" is a tired parody that seems to have been constructed from received notions of noir and mob movies. Even the jazzy score sounds like an affectation."
m/laura_smiles, It's an interesting profile in self-destruction until the script becomes unhinged itself and has Laura doing things that are not so much outrageous as hilariously stupid.
m/laurel_canyon, McDormand's powerhouse performance alone compensates for many minor deficiencies.
m/laurence_anyways," Wildly ambitious both in form and in the ideas about gender, identity, society, and love that it digs into with infectious gusto."
m/lavender," ""Lavender"" means well, but it ultimately proves that not all ghosts need a backstory. Often, just being scary - even inexplicably - is more important than being meaningful."
m/lavender_hill_mob," Delightful if mostly forgettable farce about an unexpected robbery, with nimble if showy multiple performance by Alec Guinness."
m/lavventura," Characters root themselves separately in background and foreground planes, their emotional distance rendered via the director's unnerving use of deep focus."
m/law_abiding_citizen," Cinematic headcheese assembled from umami-laden scraps of Se7en, Saw, The Dark Knight, and The Silence of the Lambs, with fun twists and superb explosions. Just don't dwell on what it's made of."
m/law_of_desire, [A] great film from Spanish director Pedro Almdovar's early career...
m/lawless_2012," Hillcoat's film wins its gasps and gulps honestly, but it doesn't remotely strain against the constraints of genre in the same way as last two equally Western-inflected films, The Proposition and The Road."
m/lawless_heart," Would perhaps make a watchable pilot for a drama series. As a feature film, it's dull."
m/lawnmower_man," This is a pretty good science fiction film, although it is a little thin on the science and strays into metaphysical fantasies."
m/lawnmower_man_2_jobes_war," Mowing the lawn might be more involving than watching this subpar sci-fi sequel, which manages to be complicated and witless at the same time."
m/lawrence_of_arabia," The only thing that really dates it is the awful makeup, orangey pancake for Lawrence, a gray-green nose for Quinn and cordovan shoe polish for Guinness."
m/laws_of_attraction, Brosnan's seductive charm outshines the dull script.
m/lay_the_favorite," Those of us who still venerate Frears as a pioneer of British indie cinema in the '80s pine for him to have higher goals than a ditzy true-crime romp, but maybe that's our problem rather than his."
m/layer_cake," As a whole, it just seems like we've seen it all before."
m/lazarus_project, ...a frustratingly surreal (and progressively interminable) piece of work.
m/lazer_team," It is the most obnoxiously unfunny comedy in many a moon, featuring four alleged protagonists so thoroughly repellant, the audience will find themselves quickly rooting against the survival of humanity."
m/lazy_eye," Essentially a single extended conversation in an unusual setting, this film strikes an honest, introspective tone as two men try to make sense of where they were once, and where they are now."
m/lazy_susan, Susan is more of a collection of quirks and bad choices. There just isn't much to her.
m/lbj," Old-fashioned and archaic next to other movies about the same era, like JACKIE & ALL THE WAY."
m/le-code-a-change-change-of-plans, A French film about the messy and perplexing dimensions of mid-life crises and the different ways people deal with them.
m/le-declin-de-lempire-americain," There's very little plot in Decline of the American Empire...but when the dialogue is this good and the characters this compelling, that's not necessarily a bad thing."
m/le-feu-follet-a-time-to-live-and-a-time-to-die-the-fire-within," It's hard not to feel impatient with the self-absorbed hero, but his ravaged face ends by arousing pity and even a pinch of awe."
m/le-sel-de-la-mer-salt-of-this-sea, May not change opinions but this pro-Palestinian film brings to life several abstractions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
m/le_amiche," An Antonioni film will frequently pose a riddle, and then never answer it; here the mystery of why Rosetta tries to kill herself becomes a pretense for the rest of the film."
m/le_cercle_rouge, This is a transitional film that makes way for a 'New Wave' of crime films soon to follow.
m/le_deuxieme_souffle," It isn't an easy film to watch, perhaps because it moves so deliberately in comparison to its American models, but this somber, repressive, and perverse work displays a ferocious moral and formal integrity."
m/le_doulos," The macho criminal underworld of French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville has a nasty, nearly misogynistic edge here..."
m/le_havre_2011," This typically deadpan saga from the maker of The Match Factory Girl, Drifting Clouds and The Man Without a Past (among other Netflix finds) exemplifes France's commitment to libert, galit, fraternit with impish sincerity."
m/le_jour_se_leve," The pity of it all seems slightly forced, the melodramatics too obvious."
m/le_mans," You can't hear the words for the noise, you can't follow the action for the speed. But you can sit back and feel distinctly stirred."
m/le_nom_des_gens_2011, This cross-cultural comedy-drama sports a bubbly performance by Sara Forestier.
m/le_passe," There is so much that Farhadi and his latest film does right, and does well...Mature and real in a way that dramas rarely aspire too, The Past posits that sometimes the only way to move on from where you've been, is to turn around and face it"
m/le_petit_lieutenant, Le Petit Lieutenant is an interesting crime thriller that has few conventional thrills but does give a fascinating look into the mechanics of a Parisian homicide squad.
m/le_samourai," It combines stylish direction, an intelligent script, first-rate performances, and overpowering atmosphere into one of the most tense and absorbing thrillers ever to reach the screen."
m/le_week_end," Roger Michell's film contains frequent nods to the French nouvelle vague (notably Jean-Luc Godard's Bande  Part), while Hanif Kureishi's screenplay may be a trifle bookish and spiky for some tastes."
m/league_of_extraordinary_gentlemen," Connery chews the scenery, beats up everybody in sight, and tries to bully his co-stars into acting."
m/league_of_their_own," Considerable money and effort was lavished on this production, but problems in the script diminish the effort."
m/lean_on_pete," Rather than a genuine relationship between the animal and the boy, it feels like Charley is projecting his needs onto the animal, who could just as easily be stuffed."
m/leap," For the cinematic dregs of late August, the earnest and quirky Leap! is charmingly en pointe."
m/leap_year_2010, Predictable as hell but delivering exactly what's advertised ... the rapport between Adams and Goode is often enough to keep this movie from totally sinking into its own formula-driven plot.
m/leap_year_2011," It's an intense, powerful and at times deeply painful movie, a serious exercise in sexual politics, and Mnica del Carmen as Laura gives an outstanding, brave performance."
m/learning_to_drive," It creeps up on you, eliciting laughs even as touches the heart. That makes it unique in the current cinematic landscape."
m/least_among_saints," Excels in performances resonating with raw intensity and dramatic authenticity. But while earnestly inspired by the tragic circumstances facing US soldiers in war for real, the material forming the basis here is without historical context, and it shows."
m/leatherface_2017," While the account is not terribly original, [Alexandre] Bustillo and [Julien] Maury bring a joie de mort giddiness to Leatherface. It's great to see their French New Wave/splatterpunk sensibilities come alive once again..."
m/leatherface_the_texas_chainsaw_massacre_3," It's certainly a cut above the standard late-'80s horror film, though hardly up to the level of Tobe Hooper's original."
m/leatherheads," During the bumpy homage to It Happened One Night, His Girl Friday, and Meet John Doe, among others, I found myself wondering what the direct antonym of deft is"
m/leave_her_to_heaven," As for the brother's death, with Ellen looking on coolly in white robe and shades, it remains one of the most perturbing in the history of Hollywood."
m/leave_it_on_the_floor, The standout film for me at both the (2011) L.A. Film Festival and Outfest. Spectacular and joyous.
m/leave_it_to_beaver, Credit the makers of Leave It to Beaver for their kindliness.
m/leave_no_trace, The film is consistently at its best when it's attuned to a quiet sense of harmony between all things.
m/leave_the_world_behind," The documentary almost gets there, and should be applauded for its visual boldness and emotional articulateness. Even if you've never attended a rave or thrown your hands in the air, the movie has a singular power."
m/leaving_home_coming_home_a_portrait_of_robert_frank," The most enjoyable parts of this moving documentary show Frank with his second wife, the sculptor June Leaf - a wonderfully feisty woman who has sustained him throughout."
m/leaving_las_vegas, A uniquely hypnotic and haunting love story sparked by Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue at their career best.
m/lebanon-2010," Without political preaching or providing traditional social commentary, Maoz has crafted a rare human drama, one that gives real insights into the horror of war. An uncomfortable ride...but one worth every penny."
m/lebanon_pa, A poignant portrait of an unlikely friendship and a pungent contrast of urban clamor and small-town murmur.
m/leclisse," The conclusion of Michelangelo Antonioni's loose trilogy (preceded by L'Avventura and La Notte), this 1961 film is conceivably the best in Antonioni's career, but significantly it has the least consequential plot."
m/lee_daniels_the_butler," An ambitious, sweeping period drama that manages to be incredibly affecting and feel as if the words ''For Your Consideration'' are stamped across every frame."
m/left_behind_2014, Fans of the evangelical-Christian film genre ... should demand higher production values instead of blindly supporting a movie just because they appreciate its themes.
m/left_behind_the_movie, Behind weaves a satisfactorily compelling end-of-the-world drama.
m/left_on_purpose," What makes the film... as ironically entertaining as it is tragic is its charismatic subject, who is articulate and fascinating even while spiraling downward emotionally."
m/legacy_black_ops," Featuring plenty of visceral thrills and presented with more intelligence than many of the thrillers which spring from Hollywood strafing cliche bullets to little effect, it suggests everyone concerned is destined for bigger, better things in the future."
m/legacy_of_lies_2020, Action movie with a pro-free speech message; violence.
m/legal_eagles, The sort of project that gives off vibes of being a carefully packaged studio deal.
m/legally_blonde," Overloaded with calculated stand-up-and-cheer moments, and there are far too many close-ups of Elle's cuddly Chihuahua."
m/legally_blonde_2_red_white_and_blonde, The filmmakers betray Elle's progress by dumbing her down for the sole purpose of having her conquer the same dumb-blonde stereotypes.
m/legend_2015," Too often Hardy's performance falls into broad ""crazy eyes"" villainy, with a voice that recalls a slightly more distinct Bane. But given Helgeland's equally pantomime surroundings, one can't really blame him too much."
m/legend_of_1900," by every definition, a beautiful film: it's lovely to look at--and perhaps even moreso to listen to; and the acting is exquisite."
m/legend_of_bagger_vance," Supernatural is not much better than subhuman: Hollywood is still, in the year 2000, disinclined to let black actors play human beings."
m/legend_of_billie_jean, Has a straight faced camp about itself that makes it a blast from the past worth sitting through
m/legend_of_drunken_master, Shortchanges character and plot in order to make time for fight scenes.
m/legend_of_hell_house, Classic ghost story inspires as many yawns as it does chills.
m/legend_of_johnny_lingo," A good-natured but somewhat slack family film...rather stilted and didactic, like a Disney live-action feature from the fifties or sixties."
m/legend_of_rita, But there's the problem with character's past...that Baglau portrays Rita as a sweet young thing is just disconcerting.
m/legend_of_the_demon_cat, This is a movie that just has a ton of imagination... It's an absolute spectacle.
m/legend_of_the_fist_the_return_of_chen_zhen," It's watchable, certainly, but it lacks anything to really draw you in and certainly won't blow you away like some of Chen Zhen's previous outings might."
m/legend_of_the_guardians," A classical heroic odyssey that boasts a spirit similar to that of The Secret of N.I.M.H., and is enhanced by such sumptuous 3-D CGI it would make Pixar blush."
m/legend_of_the_mountain," Legend of the Mountain is looser, funnier than [King Hu's] earlier wuxia films-and, at three hours, a bit of a commitment."
m/legend_of_zorro," The Legend of Zorro is a frustrating hodgepodge of a movie, as fascinating (often profoundly touching) in its parts as it is off-putting as a whole."
m/legendary, This schmaltz is better suited for TV's Hallmark Hall of Fame.
m/legends_of_oz_dorothys_return," Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return fails to make us care about the characters or their journeys, and the animation is shoddy and occasionally creepy ..."
m/legends_of_the_fall," Unless you are a big fan of seeing hearts cut out of the bodies of animals and people or unless you feel you must see all of Brad Pitt's movies (he is major handsome), I can see no reason to see this film other than as a long travelogue."
m/legion_2010, The goofiest plundering of the Bible since Christopher Walkin's 'Prophecy' pictures...a combination of horror movie cliche and pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo that proves a pretty fetid brew.
m/legion_of_brothers," A harrowing documentary portrait of the earliest months of the war in Afghanistan, Legion of Brothers meanders in its storytelling but ultimately hits a nerve."
m/legionnaire," Van Damme delivers a monotonic performance that is sufficient to cure the worst cases of insomnia imaginable -- and that, mes amis, is the good news."
m/lemony_snicket," The picture is a beautifully foreboding storybook sprung to life, mixing guffaw-inducing comedy, frightful fantasy, and resonating drama without missing a beat."
m/lenfant_2006, The infant grabs hold of the viewer's heart with his sheer vulnerability and dependence on parents who are only beginning to learn how to take care of themselves.
m/lenfant_den_haut, A cool yet compassionate look at two people bound by love and shared struggles in a world of haves and have-nots.
m/lenfer-dhenrigeorges-clouzot, What survives is a striking cautionary tale for budding filmmakers and a haunting evocation of experimentation run amok.
m/lenny," Dustin Hoffman gives one of his best performances, and the choice to shoot the film in matted black and white is bold and beautiful."
m/leon_the_professional," It is stylish, darkly humorous, and almost artsy in its approach to the genre."
m/leonard_cohen_im_your_man," Captures the elegance, wit, spiritual longing and deep hum-ability of Cohen's work."
m/leprechaun, Mildly diverting horror silliness followed by dreadful sequels.
m/leprechaun-in-the-hood, Such a title tells you all you need to know about the story.
m/leprechaun_4_in_space, [A] singularly unlovely and weird piece of cinematic detritus.
m/leprechaun_back_2_tha_hood," The film's not good, exactly, but it's certainly miles beyond the last two episodes..."
m/leprechaun_origins," Leprechaun: Origins isn't just bad - it's downright insulting. Lipovski's film is nothing but a series of bad choices, worse execution and infuriating redundancy, highlighting the ugliness that comes along with exploiting horror instead of respecting it."
m/leprechaun_returns," Kostanski should really be working with material that matches his imagination and wonderfully silly sense of humor, but this career detour is acceptable fun, and the first Warwick-less installment to ease the pain of the actor's absence."
m/leroy_and_stitch," Thankfully, the movie's conclusion seems to indicate that no further installments are forthcoming - a welcome development, to be sure."
m/les-plages-dagnes," By turns insightful, schmaltzy, anecdotal, critical and nostalgic."
m/les_amours_imaginaires," The romantic-farce plot is nicely structured, the characters are written more sharply, and Stphanie Anne Weber Biron's glossy images are a pleasure to behold."
m/les_aventures_de_pinocchio, For all the effort that clearly went into its production... the new film simply doesn't generate much magical enchantment.
m/les_femmes_de_lombre," Salom... struggles to resist the occupation of his film by misplaced clich and awkward melodrama, undermining any claim to authenticity."
m/les_femmes_du_6e_etage_2011," Doing that type of farce the French often do oh so well, 'Service Entrance' maintains a steady beat of humor throughout the film, spicing it up with a little class consciousness and a dose of romancE."
m/les_miserables_2012, Les Mis is also uplifting and the opposite of a miserable experience. In fact it should be called Le Magnifique.
m/lesbian_vampire_killers, Agreeably goofy but surprisingly mild horror-comedy...that's several guffaws short of a laff riot.
m/leslie_jones_time_machine," Jones pauses a couple of times to genuinely be in the moment, and though much of the hour leans on surveying the past and making observations (not all of them groundbreaking), there's a bigger takeaway: Take up space now."
m/less_than_zero," Meant to be a statement against the amoral lifestyle of super-rich youth, it misses the mark by a mile."
m/lessons_of_darkness_1995, One of the few films that truly deserves to be labeled with the adjective astonishing.
m/let_fury_have_the_hour_2013," On a political level, the film is far from a Godardian dialectic, so the view of history that emerges is, to say the least, blinkered."
m/let_him_have_it," In his reconstruction of the trial, Medak is unforgiving, showing a legal system less concerned with justice than with proving itself correct."
m/let_it_rain," Touching on everything from family to fidelity, politics to prejudice, this is a slice of dystopic domesticity that captures the disappointments of life and the little joys that make it worthwhile."
m/let_it_ride, quirky but fun comedy. Dreyfuss is charming as the compulsive gambler.
m/let_it_snow_2019, Let It Snow offers enough feel-good moments to provide a good start to the Netflix Christmas romance season.
m/let_me_in," This unsettling, effective American remake really gets under the skin as one of the year's most powerful thrillers."
m/let_my_people_go_2011," Among gay Jewish French postman movies, ""Let My People Go!"" may be a Hall of Fame entry, but alas, by any other standard this would-be sex comedy is a dismal failure."
m/let_the_bullets_fly," At least 30 minutes and several scams too long, the plot passes from amusing to confounding long before the final double-cross."
m/let_the_fire_burn_2013," Telling its riveting, despairing tale entirely through archival footage, the terrific documentary ""Let the Fire Burn"" has the force and intrigue of a courtroom thriller."
m/let_the_right_one_in, Let the Right One In is a chiller in more ways than one.
m/let_the_sunshine_in, A good bit of fun scrambling about in the darkness.
m/let_there_be_light_2017_2," Everything is rushed in the movie, including the tear-jerker ending. None of these characters are really believable, but I have to give it up for Sorbo, he does a pretty good acting job, while playing a poorly-written character."
m/let_us_prey," ...if the storytelling is a bit loose, it's more than made up for by the splendid cinematography of Piers McGrail and O'Malley's knowing exploitation of horror tropes."
m/lethal_weapon," A vivid, visceral reminder of just how exciting an action film can be."
m/lethal_weapon_2," This is a loud, abrasive, brainless action picture liberally sprinkled with comedy, and it will probably do every bit as well at the box office as its predecessor. But it's also as lightweight, silly and raunchy as they come."
m/lethal_weapon_3," The worst in the series --s till an acceptable actioner, but more calculated than it's predecessors (and successor)"
m/lethal_weapon_4," No longer lethal, Detective Riggs is a crotchety middle-aged weapon now"
m/lets_be_cops," The only truly lethal weapons in the criminally unfunny action comedy ""Let's Be Cops'' are the lame script, putrid direction and pair of sitcom stars mugging nonstop in frantic pursuit of laughs that have fled over the state line."
m/lets_be_evil, I recommend this one only for die-hard fans of killer kids horror.
m/lets_get_lost_1989," A gripping and affecting film with a striking noirish look (well photographed by Jeff Preiss), but also a rather dumb one that is both enhanced and limited by Weber's pie-eyed adoration of his subject."
m/lets_go_to_prison," The sad thing is that Arnett, Shepard and McBride quickly establish a loose, easy camaraderie that's a real pleasure to watch. The shame is that they're working with such unrewarding material."
m/lets_kill_wards_wife_2015," Any pretense of satire collapses by the film's midpoint, leaving only the contempt."
m/letter_from_an_unknown_woman, Beneath the film's beauty lies the type of love that obsessed Ophuls: the unsuccessful kind.
m/letter_to_three_wives," Mankiewicz's plot device is brilliant and intriguing: On the way to an annual picnic, three housewives learn through a letter that the town's most desirable woman had run off with one of their husbands--flashbacks reveal the state of their marriages."
m/letters_from_baghdad, One of the most cinematically beautiful documentaries ever is a phenomenal portrait of a shamefully forgotten woman who helped shape political history.
m/letters_from_iwo_jima," Taken together, Flags and Letters represent a genuinely imposing achievement, one that looks at war unflinchingly -- that does not deny its necessity but above all laments the human loss it entails."
m/letters_to_god, There is no complexity to these characters at all and the relentless pitch for prayer as the answer to all life(TM)s problems is laid on like molasses.
m/letters_to_juliet, Well and truly geared to a female audience who are likely to savour the fanciful plot and neatly wrapped feel-good denouement.
m/levantando_a_papa, The story is fairly slight and some of the characters are broadly drawn or not sketched at all.
m/level_16," Level 16 is a sharp little sci-fi thriller that does dystopia right, and like all the best bleak visions of a future world, it offers commentary worth sinking your teeth into."
m/level_five, The most extraordinarily contemporary thing about Marker's intricate matrix (in a William Gibson rather than a Wachowskis sense of the concept) is how beautifully it lines up with and enlarges the contexts of recent films.
m/leviafan, The sweeping seascapes and beauty of the landscape the director captures are a hymn to this troubled and troubling country.
m/leviathan," Leviathan is intermittently interesting, but it's a bad sign that the movie starts losing its punch when the monster shows up."
m/leviathan_2012," Leviathan is a titanic achievement, a visceral overload whose impact registers immediately and with great force."
m/levitated_mass_the_story_of_michael_heizers_monolithic_sculpture_2013," Pray's film, though not as weighty or groundbreaking - no pun intended - as its subject, nevertheless does a good job of presenting both art and artist ..."
m/lez_bomb," Overwritten and overlit, Lez Bomb frequently undercuts its own charms."
m/lfe_happens," It all sounds dreadful, like the pilot for another brainless comedy series on network TV, but it grows on you."
m/lfo_the_movie," LFO is ambitious and bizarre enough to work on levels that some might not hear ringing clearly, yet its presence cannot be ignored."
m/liam_gallagher_as_it_was, Borderline parody? Possibly - but Liam's charm makes this quite irresistible.
m/lianna_2001," An appealing movie about love, friendship, and camaraderie."
m/libeled_lady," The tone remains upbeat despite all the dodgy dealings, making this a cheery and entertaining film throughout."
m/liberal_arts," [VIDEO ESSAY] Writer-director-actor Josh Radnor follows up his debut feature (""Happythankyoumoreplease"") with a compact romantic comedy that almost works, but not quite."
m/libertine," The second half, especially, grows dour and maundering, and by the end the movie seems to flail in desperation, more like a work in progress than like a finished piece."
m/liberty_heights," Both epic and intimate, taking on a large cast of characters while focusing quietly on the details of their lives."
m/liberty_kid," Unanswered questions about Derrick's kids and Spanish-speaking mother abound, and their all-too-infrequent interactions point to a hard-knuckled realism about post-9/11 New York that begs to be seen."
m/librarian_quest_for_the_spear," It's a fun cheesy cable TV flick, a slice of winking B movie giddiness that charms us into smiling through all the nonsense."
m/licence_to_kill," Where are the signature chase scenes, the sexual humor and the romantic trysts that we come to Bond films for in the first place?"
m/license_to_drive, It's the two Coreys at the height of their popularity; make sure your children avert their eyes... by gouging them out if necessary.
m/lies_and_alibis," Coogan  um ator sempre divertido e aqui trabalha com um roteiro que, apesar de implausvel,  dotado de suficiente auto-ironia para divertir sem ser levado a srio."
m/life-of-pi," After making the disappointing Taking Woodstock, the versatile Ang Lee is back on terra firma with this enchanting fable of a shipwrecked adolescent and a tiger, which bears the markings of a great film but falls short of masterpiece."
m/life_2014," By the end a certain frustration has set in, with not quite enough payback to justify the script's slow-burn dramatic arc."
m/life_2017, A riveting reminder that it still ain't smart to mess with Mother Nature!
m/life_2_0, A disturbing but nonjudgmental study of online addiction and the lure of manufactured identities.
m/life_above_all_2010," Hypocrisy, ignorance and fear are seen with almost unbearable clarity through the eyes of a South African girl in this unflinching study of Aids stigma."
m/life_after_beth, A film that succeeds in both its low key premise and extraordinary conclusion ...
m/life_after_flash," An excitable, aggressive hug of a movie. Overflowing with appreciation, or downright passion, for the exuberant adaptation of the comic book serial."""
m/life_and_death_of_colonel_blimp, It stands as very possibly the finest film ever made in Britain.
m/life_and_times_of_judge_roy_bean," Milius' screenplay is acridly flavorful, Huston gives it a mellow reading"
m/life_animated," Disney's role in the lives of children around the world is indisputable, but the company would be hard-pressed to find a better example to be proud of than the autistic subject of Life, Animated."
m/life_aquatic, Quirky and Bill Murray-ish but doesn't always click.
m/life_as_a_house, It doesn't trust the audience enough to keep from laying on the schmaltz.
m/life_before_her_eyes," A melodramatic portrait of violence and mourning, Vadim Perelman's disappointing follow-up to House of Sand and Fog turns Laura Kasischke's novel into an overly precious, pseudo-poetic meditation in which the pain of loss is indulged rather than examined."
m/life_in_a_metro," Anurag Basu picks a superb ensemble cast to spin out a collage of little stories about people, love and lust, trust and betrayal, truth and lies."
m/life_inside_out_2013," The earnest film's straightforwardness and down-to-earth characters have a gentle appeal, but its tendency to spell out every emotion and theme in on-the-nose dialogue undercuts its potential impact at nearly every turn."
m/life_is_hot_in_cracktown," About as credible as a middle school production of Death of a Salesman. The unspectacular storylines plod along, dragged down by lackluster performances and sloppy direction."
m/life_itself, A profoundly moving story about one of cinema's greatest superheroes.
m/life_less_ordinary, Impressive ambitions that fail at every turn. Ewan's really quite uncharacteristically dreadful.
m/life_of_a_king_2013," Though ostensibly based on a true story, the film feels like it has been finessed, exaggerated, and beaten into formulaic fiction. It's a twisted parody of high school and mentoring whose achievements are entirely accidental."
m/life_of_crime_2013," An Elmore Leonard adaptation with less snap-and-crackle than usual, Daniel Schechter's Life of Crime starts promisingly and ends with a smile but underwhelms in between."
m/life_of_david_gale," Glitzy, yes, challenging credibility, maybe, but nonetheless a clever thriller emerges from a political diatribe."
m/life_of_emile_zola, This look at how screwed up the French legal system is can be harrowing.
m/life_of_riley, So frothy and chiffonesque it threatens to burst its own cheeks.
m/life_of_the_party_2018, [Melissa] McCarthy must have gone shopping at the film stereotype thrift store to find the character.
m/life_on_the_line_2016, A terrible movie about the workers who keep the electrical grid functioning.
m/life_or_something_like_it," To enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns, you have to gloss over the no sense ending."
m/life_partners," These characters, all of whom feel fleshed out and thoroughly lived-in, constitute the foundation of a story that unfolds organically, blessedly free of the twee self-regard common to films about millennials in flux."
m/life_stinks," About 90% of the jokes elicit blank, polite stares, not laughs. The film is as raggedy and forlorn as its hero."
m/life_tracker, This is the first feature from writer-director Joe McClean and he has made a debut that is admittedly uneven but not without promise.
m/life_with_father," Dunn and Powell are adorable, musty charm in this sweet family classic."
m/life_with_mikey, ...a forgotten relic within Fox's spotty body of work.
m/lifeboat," boasts the filmmaker's trademark technical polish: His command over editing, framing, and optical effects deftly masters the challenges of a water-borne production"
m/lifechanger," Lifechanger may initially present itself as an idiosyncratic spin on the slasher, but it is ultimately a tragedy, tracing one man's very gradual realisation that what he had always deemed ""necessary"" was in fact a matter of moral choice"
m/lifeforce," Quite possibly the silliest horror movie ever made. On the other hand, you get to see Patrick Stewart kiss a man full on the mouth."
m/lifes_a_breeze_2013, The film's surface naturalism and visual grit simply cover up a screenplay that's as full of crap as the average recent Hollywood comedy.
m/light_at_the_edge_of_the_world," A mixed bag. Moments of beauty and passion, but also moments that drag. Environmentalist gone Reality TV."
m/light_it_up, Writer-director Craig Bolotin dares what few filmmakers have when dealing with such volatile subject matter; he takes the teens' side.
m/light_of_my_life," Scene for scene, Affleck does a decent job of directing - his touch is soft, intimate, humane - but he has saddled himself with a script that isn't entirely there."
m/light_sleeper, A superb Dafoe contributes crucially to the degree of success the film achieves.
m/lights_out_2016, Lights Out does for fear of the dark what Halloween did for slashers.
m/like-dandelion-dust, Like Dandelion Dust is the type of sobering family drama that could have turned out sappy and cliched. It didn't.
m/like_a_boss," A witless, tedious, sophomoric and painfully unfunny attempt at comedy. Why wasn't it released straight-to-VOD?"
m/like_crazy," Like Crazy is an exquisite, beautifully acted gem of a film, one that should serve as a prelude to bigger things for stars Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin, as well as director Drake Doremus."
m/like_father_2018," Like Father ends up challenging the value of resentment in a way that few movies can, or will, or want to."
m/like_father_like_son_2013," Hirokazu directs a difficult scenario with sensitivity, but also plenty of mirth, emotional warmth and dramatic aplomb."
m/like_me," Unfortunately it drops off badly, descending into tedium well before the end is reached, but some of the imagery is hard to forget."
m/like_mike," Like Mike doesn't win any points for originality. It does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style, and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism."
m/like_minds," If great minds think alike, they'll be giving this one a miss."
m/like_someone_in_love," I know there's something happening here, but I don't know what it is."
m/like_stars_on_earth, An inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining.
m/like_water_for_chocolate, Like Water for Chocolate is a lushly photographed family saga about the enchantments of food and unrequited love.
m/lil_quinquin, Heavyweight French auteur Bruno Dumont demonstrates his gift for deadpan comedy.
m/lila_and_eve," It's an instant camp classic, especially because it takes itself so adorably seriously."
m/lila_lila, A charming German romantic comedy about the adoration of writers and the perks of literary stardom.
m/lila_says, ...[director Ziad] Doueiri does manage to paint an indelible portrait of this small town and it seems clear that he's destined for bigger and better things.
m/lilith, The awkwardness of a macho auteur attempting feminized poetry lends the work the nervousness necessary for authentic lyricism
m/lilo_and_stitch," A curious hybrid of a movie, but it's still a good deal of fun, and it looks absolutely scrumptious."
m/lilo_and_stitch_2," After a rough start, Lilo and Stitch 2 finally finds its story to become an emotional and entertaining film... climax will require parents to have frank discussions with kids"
m/lilting," Sometimes, feelings and emotion can convey more than words will ever say, and although this is one of the film's central ideas it's also one Khaou would have been wise to heed himself."
m/limbo_1999," Sayles has started with a domestic comedy, and led us unswervingly into the heart of darkness."
m/limelight, The at-long-last meeting of Chaplin and Keaton makes this a must.
m/limelight_2011," Limelight, like the club it's named after, doesn't do much to break the mold of sex-drugs-and-star****ers sameness afflicting this particular subgenre."
m/limey," The movie has lots of drive, and it keeps Stamp front and center almost continuously, even in flashbacks."
m/limitless," It's a gee-whizz novelty movie along the lines of Inception, with great effects and some visual wows."
m/limits_of_control," It just feels tired and recycled -- the referencing of Rimbaud and Blake, the flagrant hipsterism that here falsifies rather than refreshes...the above-it-all attitude toward connecting on a human level."
m/lincoln_2011," With Lincoln, director Steven Spielberg and star Daniel Day-Lewis deliver a poignant portrait of the slain U.S. President's struggle to end slavery and the Civil War."
m/lincoln_lawyer, A courtroom drama about a wheeler-dealer defense attorney caught in a tight squeeze that tests his ethical integrity.
m/linda_ronstadt_the_sound_of_my_voice, A fitting tribute to a woman worthy of one whether or not she thinks so.
m/line_of_duty_2019, A cop races against the clock to save a kidnapping victim ... while screenwriter Jeremy Drysdale races to turn a silly movie into a patently ridiculous one.
m/linsanity_2013, While it's a shame Leong couldn't find a fresher approach to Lin's story...he does well in setting the stakes. The greatest basketball phenomenon of the last several years takes care of the rest.
m/lion_2016, It's refreshing to see the complications of a mixed racial identity brought to the screen. It might never roar but it's still a fierce contender.
m/lion_king_1_12," As far as straight-to-video Disney sequels go, it doesn't get much better than The Lion King 1 1/2."
m/lionheart_1990," The scriptwriters, first-time director Sheldon Lettich (Sylvester Stallone's collaborator on ""Rambo III"") and Van Damme himself, dream up the worst things that could possibly happen. Then they try to kick their way out of them."
m/lions_for_lambs," Lions for Lambs is, to put it mildly, beyond stagey."
m/lipstick, Lamont Johnson buys wholesale into scripter David Rayfiel's dissection of the fine line between image and reality.
m/lipstick_and_dynamite_the_first_ladies_of_wrestling, Director Ruth Leitman's interviews are lax and inconclusive.
m/listen_up_philip," Listen Up Philip is the third feature from Alex Ross-Perry, the new master of the awkward and uncomfortable cinematic experience."
m/listening_2014," Sullins' movie has its heart and brain in the right place, but its guts are a mess."
m/literally_right_before_aaron," Pathetic 'anti-romantic' comedy, revolving around a petulant jerk."
m/little_2019," The pacing issues, the length of the film and the scattershot laughs are just enough to keep me from recommending it."
m/little_accidents_2015," A well-acted, thoroughly involving drama set in a small West Virginia town in the wake of a mining disaster that has killed ten men."
m/little_ashes," Artists' lives are rarely as interesting as their art, and Little Ashes risks trivializing its subjects' work as mere responses to history."
m/little_big_league," The first third or so of Little Big League is warm and winning - and has some big laughs. But as it progresses, the drama becomes more sentimental and stagnant, and the film begins to drag."
m/little_big_soldier," Jackie Chan has made plenty of cracking films in his native tongue, but Little Big Soldier, a rambunctiously tragicomic martial epic set during China's Warring States period, is regrettably not one of them."
m/little_birds," Juno Temple is particularly appealing as a 15 year old who's fragile, but bored enough to do almost anything bad."
m/little_black_book," The predictable, big confrontation scene goes on for what feels like an eternity."
m/little_boy_2015," Somewhere amid the storytelling rubble in ""Little Boy"" there's a decent message against racial prejudice. But it's suffocated beneath a hokey premise and hopelessly square execution."
m/little_buddha, Has some captivating qualities about both contemporary American life and Tibetan Buddhism.
m/little_caesar, Edward G. Robinson in the performance of his career.
m/little_children, Compelling in the way it explores the notion that adults always cruelly use children for their own ends.
m/little_dieter_needs_to_fly_escape_from_laos," There are a lot of current motion pictures that have had difficulty creating even one compelling character. Little Dieter Needs to Fly has just one subject, but his life could make several interesting movies."
m/little_evil, 'Little Evil' combines comedy and horror in a clever offering with plenty of chuckles and scary sights for fans of both genres.
m/little_fockers, A lazy attempt to milk a few more laughs and bucks from the enormously lucrative property.
m/little_foxes," When viewed today, the hysterical melodrama seems creaky."
m/little_fugitive_1953," At its core, this pioneering independent film, from 1953, is just an urban heart-warmer, but it has a fresh, gritty surface and a Grade A horror-comic hook ..."
m/little_giants," Unoriginal kids sports movie. Been there, done that. This is no Mighty Ducks."
m/little_girl_who_lives_down_the_lane," A cult classic worthy of a wider following, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is ripe for rediscovery and features Jodie Foster in her first (and one of her best) lead performances."
m/little_italy_2018, An often excruciatingly irrelevant piece of work...
m/little_jerusalem, It evaporates from your mind even while watching it.
m/little_joe," A lifeless, tone-deaf variation on Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Little Joe rots on its own vine."
m/little_man, The Wayans family's latest dim-witted fart comedy is even worse than its last one
m/little_man_2005," A deeply personal, often wrenching documentary that raises pertinent and difficult questions about choices made and their potential ramifications."
m/little_man_tate," Despite quirky, fresh moments and a watchful, touching performance from Hann-Byrd, the movie lurches unsteadily from scene to scene, punctuated by odd bursts of irrelevant melodrama and culminating in an ending that is frankly baffling."
m/little_manhattan," Reliving the roller-coaster ride of young love from the point of view of these phenomenal young actors offers a humorous escape from the adult world, where the little things in relationships are often taken for granted."
m/little_men_2016," The beauty of ""Little Men"" - and of the director's work in general - is that it displays a rare understanding of how the world works."
m/little_mermaid_ariels_beginning," for young girls and die-hard Little Mermaid fans, it works"
m/little_miss_sunshine," [Little Miss Sunshine] offers a surprising mix of dark humor and heart, with rich performances from a strong cast."
m/little_monsters," Some of it is actually funny, if you still have a little brattiness left in your Bratskeller."
m/little_monsters_2019, Lupita Nyong'o in a B-movie stylized horror comedy was the film I never knew I needed
m/little_nicky, Has all the makings of another big hit for Sandler.
m/little_nikita," Not a shade on ""Running on Empty"", but a nicely performed encore"
m/little_pink_house," The cast works diligently, and Keener is scrappy but calm throughout, with a convincing naturalism as a woman with tremendous strength and a powerful belief in civil rights."
m/little_red_wagon_2012," Even the cheesiest inspirational flicks have to be populated with characters who have something at stake. Conflict is the heart of good storytelling, and ""Little Red Wagon"" is conflict-free to the point of catatonia."
m/little_secrets," Sugary sweet, heavily didactic and relentlessly uplifting, it should probably come with a warning that diabetics could be endangered by watching it."
m/little_sister_2016," The movie could use a bit more focus (it's got three or four too many endings), but it's held aloft by its tiny moments of truth."
m/little_vampire, The monsters in The Little Vampire are considerably toned down from the frightening undead of the Dracula myth. Now they're just the thing to entertain grade-school trick-or-treaters.
m/little_voice," Little Voice loses its way at points, especially in its hurried, portentous ending. Yet it never obscures the blinding talent of Horrocks."
m/little_white_lie," That story is interesting enough, though Schwartz uses it mainly as a pretext for navel-gazing."
m/little_white_lies," Undeniably subtle, affecting and -- at times -- masterfully directed. Unfortunately, it's also totally forgettable."
m/little_women_2018," It has ideal charm and, most important of all, sincerity, offering the faithful a heartfelt update that respects Alcott's prime message of familial love while inoffensively trying to modernize the saga for a more contemporary teen audience."
m/little_woods," The life-on-the-margins drama makes a fine, tense vehicle for Tessa Thompson, who in the last few years has stood out in a variety of genres."
m/littlerock," A nicely pitched filmic playlet on how others see us, Littlerock puts Middle America under a microscope and breathes life into the mundane."
m/littlest_rebel," Even without the race problems, it's not that great a tale."
m/live_and_let_die," Roger Moore's inauspicious screen debut as 007. He had big shoes to fill with Connery gone, and this first of his long series of Bond associations proved less than promising."
m/live_at_the_foxes_den," The script putters around aimlessly; the camerawork was more varied on ""Cheers."""
m/live_by_night," ""Live By Night"" is missing bite. And without teeth, all the picture can do is slosh around without focus earning the unfortunate distinction of a directorial career worst for Affleck."
m/live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow," ""It's a razzle-dazzle triumph, and one we can't wait to experience again and again and again..."""
m/live_flesh, A sparkling and mature entertainment told and performed with the passion of artists.
m/live_free_or_die_hard," Willis lumbers through the movie like an angry dinosaur, while Wiseman panders to a generation that wasn't even born when the first flick was released. 'Yippie-kay-yay, motherfu-' -- whoops, can't say that one anymore either."
m/live_in_maid," Writer-director Gaggero shoots for a kind of docu-realism, with a few overtly cinematic interludes, like one well-paced split-screen sequence."
m/live_nude_girls_unite," It's not slick, it has some lapses, it sometimes looks like a home movie, but it's never boring."
m/living_daylights, An entertaining enough addition to the long-running series.
m/living_in_emergency_stories_of_doctors_without_borders, Living in Emergency: Stories of Doctors Without Borders takes a rough -- in several senses -- measure of how humanitarian aid works.
m/living_in_oblivion," Sluggish, dumbly overpraised farce about an indie movie I would never see, but I still might pick over this one."
m/living_is_easy_with_eyes_closed," While the stakes of the film may not be particularly high, you can't help but feel invested in the journey."
m/living_out_loud," A wonderfully crafted movie that has the resourcefulness to encourage Holly Hunter to dance, Danny DeVito to sing, and Queen Latifah to act."
m/living_wake, So insistently irritating and so consistently lacking in laughs that Sol Tryon's alleged comedy quickly becomes an exercise in exhaustion.
m/liyana," Though Liyana often feels more like an exercise in storytelling than a complete narrative, it is heartwarming to see the kids light up as they work together to create art out of their hardship."
m/lizzie_2018, The stylish and haunting Lizzie paints a provocative portrait of a woman driven by passions and left with few options in a society that gave her little agency.
m/lizzie_borden_took_an_ax," It's slow and heavy-handed, tedious almost throughout. An average episode of Oxygen's Snapped isn't this dull, and has more interesting things to say about women who kill."
m/lizzie_mcguire_movie," The Lizzie McGuire Movie is like the big, warm pans of homemade brownies your mom used to make: sweet, simple, familiar and, ultimately, satisfying."
m/lo_and_behold_reveries_of_the_connected_world," There's little refuting Herzog's gift as a documentarian. Even condensed, his interviews manage to squeeze fresh stories from people and technology exhaustively covered by books and media."
m/local_color," Local Color is a sensitive portrayal of a young painter trying to sharpen his gifts and it's also a deeply flawed piece of filmmaking. It's a movie that will have you loving and loathing the world of art, often in the same instant."
m/lock_stock_and_two_smoking_barrels," Even when the violence gets out of control, as bad as 'a bad day in Bosnia,' there's an underlying level of wit and humor."
m/locke, A virtuoso narrative and technical experiment that doesn't stint on dramatic complexity or heart.
m/locker_13," Only those scared of being bored to death need fear ""Locker 13,"" an omnibus of horror stories that could hardly be more tame, talky and tepid, both individually and as a whole."
m/lockout_2012, Who cares about subpar computer-generated work when Guy Pearce is a one-man cartoon badass spectacle all to himself?
m/logan_2017," Although it's a ""super-hero movie"", Logan is not about action, but about characters and their relationships. [Full review in Portuguese.]"
m/logan_lucky," The kind of small-scale, shaggy dog story Hollywood rarely makes these days."
m/logans_run," Maybe its ambitions outpace its performance, but at least it tries."
m/loggerheads, A delicate if somewhat soap-operatic Southern mood piece that occasionally clicks.
m/loins_of_punjab_presents, An uninspired cultural comedy with a few sharp lines to recommend it.
m/loitering_with_intent," It might be slight, but Loitering With Intent is fast, funny, and incredibly heartfelt."
m/lol," The film has the quality of something tended to by many affectionate hands, a houseplant that blooms slightly more than it sags."
m/lola_versus," It's one girl against the world in Lola Versus, a snappy yet sincere romantic comedy that begins where others end, with the proposal and wedding plans pointing toward happily ever after."
m/london-boulevard," Essentially, London Boulevard is a long but not very winding road."
m/london_fields," As it stands, the only thing London Fields has going for it is that it's messy and weird enough to hopefully provoke those who have never read Amis to consider trying him out."
m/london_has_fallen," London Has Fallen is as dopey as its predecessor, Olympus Has Fallen. But it's dopey in an entirely different way."
m/london_river, London River effectively sidesteps direct comment and full-blown tragedy in favour of mild melodrama and a heartening dose of diversity-studies sermonising.
m/london_the_modern_babylon," This isn't the cinema's last word on London, but it will silence competitors for a few years to come."
m/london_town_2016," The era's skinhead riots and striking workers - and Strummer's biting, pro-immigrant lyrics - are never more than window dressing in a movie that would rather scatter fairy dust than grit."
m/londons_finest," The film-making is clunky, the voiceover from dealer Sirus (Nathanael Wiseman) is irksome and the gangster-police showdown is merely a showcase for some severed fingers and very large guns."
m/lone_ranger_and_the_lost_city_of_gold," OK Lone Ranger western, but inferior to great Clayton Moore first Ranger feature."
m/lone_survivor," A scorching, often unbearably brutal account of a June 2005 military mission that claimed the lives of 19 U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan's Kunar province."
m/lone_wolf_and_cub_baby_cart_at_the_river_styx, The action is excellent and nearly non-stop. Ogami Itto whirls the Katana and Naginata as nimbly as a marching band baton girl.
m/lone_wolf_and_cub_sword_of_vengeance," Mostly dedicated to character setup and plot exposition, the sword work is still amazing, thanks to Wakyama Tomisaburo's real-life expertise in Kendo and Iaido."
m/loneliness_of_the_long_distance_runner," The film, with its grim Nottingham setting and working class milieu, must have seemed fresh in its day. Now, though, it looks and sounds like a relic from a bygone era."
m/lonely_are_the_brave," Douglas oferece uma atuao curiosamente divertida, mas o roteiro de Dalton Trumbo (normalmente um mestre) fracassa ao se concentrar na longa perseguio em vez de fornecer elementos para que possamos comprender melhor as motivaes do protagonista."
m/lonely_guy, The least satisfying of Steve Martin's early movies.
m/lonely_hearts," While not much of a detective story, [director] Robinson's period film does provide a captivating look at the dynamics that turn Fernandez and Beck into serial killers."
m/lonesome_jim," There is a sweetness, eventually, under the detached comedy of this funny, uneven film."
m/long-weekend-2008," Nature's Grave violates one of the first rules of remakes - if you're not going to be as good, or try to improve on, what came before, you really shouldn't bother."
m/long_gray_line," Atmospheric, unusual Tyrone Power vehicle--no less different for director John Ford."
m/long_kiss_goodnight," I can't deny that The Long Kiss Goodnight made me laugh, and that there was never a time when I was bored."
m/long_life_happiness_and_prosperity," With the sure hand of a skilled miniaturist, Mina Shum has crafted a nearly flawless film."
m/long_long_trailer, ...not even Minnelli and Berman could do much with a predictably inane script.
m/long_riders, The Long Riders is well-done film about the legendary Jesse James.
m/long_ships," This is pure rubbish, but thoroughly enjoyable rubbish."
m/long_shot_2019, A rom-com with a political edge that will be one of this year's most beloved crowdpleasers.
m/long_shot_the_kevin_laue_story_2012, [Pounds] home its points via a seemingly endless series of sound bites that forms the chief content of the first half.
m/long_way_north," Long Way North may not go down as a modern classic, but its sophisticated style and excitingly feminist approach should appeal to viewers of all ages."
m/longest_day," A far cry from the gore-drenched Saving Private Ryan, legendary producer Darryl F. Zanuck's heartfelt recreation of the D-Day landings is, in its own way, every bit as memorable."
m/longest_yard, Considerably darker and grittier than most of Sandler's frothy comedies...
m/longing_2018," Longing seems stranded, too slick and insubstantial to be an art house movie but too depressing and dark to be any fun."
m/longshots," A surprisingly tepid directorial effort by Limp Bizkit nu-metal rocker Fred Durst, pic seldom deviates from the genre-cliche playbook."
m/look_at_us_now_mother, The most astonishing thing about the documentary-and by extension Gayle's strengths as a documentarian-is its ability to alternately inspire anger and empathy towards Mildred.
m/look_away, Look Away is the perfect movie to see at the theater. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/look_whos_talking," The audience around me found it funnier than I did; for me, Look Who's Talking is a one-joke movie that wears out its welcome rather quickly."
m/look_whos_talking_now, A crude and mawkish film in which dogs attempt to communicate with Kirstie Alley and John Travolta.
m/looker, This is the kind of shoddy time-filler that Oscar-calibre actors clearly do only to pay the rent. Plenty of unintentional giggles though.
m/lookin_to_get_out," Despite its overall lightheartedness, it now seems like one of [Hal Ashby]'s major works."
m/looking_for_an_echo," The tale of a former doo-wop singer and his friends, is a very appealing mix of pop music, romance, and family drama."
m/looking_for_comedy_in_the_muslim_world, By bombing in the Muslim world--in the comedic sense--Brooks produces one of his funniest films in years.
m/looking_for_eric," This is the nearest he will ever get to a feelgood movie, and may well become one of his most successful."
m/looking_for_richard," If you go to see it, hang in there and you will be rewarded with something special."
m/looking_glass_2017, Bargain basement. If it was made in the nineties would have been a routine skin-e-max programmer.
m/lookout," I haven't raved so much over a film's ability to stop my pulse, as this one did, since ""Maria Full of Grace."""
m/looney_tunes_back_in_action," Tunes strives for the surrealism of Roger Rabbit, yet delivers the entertainment equivalent of life inside a pinball machine."
m/looper," Savvy, nasty fun, then, and seeing Brucie still able to pull off the tough guy is a form of time travel all in itself."
m/loopers_the_caddies_long_walk, This may be outdoor work with heavy lifting but it's not short on rewards and [Jason] Baffa's film teases them out like those secrets shared on a long walk along the links.
m/loose_cannons, Dan Aykroyd's dexterous multipersonality schtick is the only redeeming feature of this chase-heavy comedy.
m/loosies, Loosies has a bevy of colorful character actors -- from Michael Madsen and William Forsythe to Vincent Gallo and Joe Pantoliano -- but little character.
m/loot_2009," A treasure hunter who has travelled far and wide looking for long-lost fortunes, Lance Larson's questing serves as point of departure for the beguiling documentary, Loot."
m/lootera," It's not at all trite to state that by the hauntingly bittersweet end, everything magically falls into place, for there is true magic in Motwane's mastery in crafting a such a poetic, passionately felt, and perfectly realized work of art."
m/lora-di-religione-il-sorriso-di-mia-madre-the-religion-hour-my-mothers-smile," Bellocchio has a way of spelling everything out for the audience; nonetheless, the film's intellectualism is both provocative and remarkably playful."
m/lord_byron," Vacillating between free-associative shtick and complete inertia, Lord Byron is lost in thought and allergic to reason."
m/lord_jim_1965," Well-acted beautifully photographed, though overly-long and melodramatic."
m/lord_of_the_flies, A rousing remake of the classic tale by William Golding about the dark side of human nature
m/lord_of_the_flies_1963, the most effective way of visually capturing the essence of Golding's Lord of the Flies
m/lord_of_the_rings," A showcase for inspired imagery and sheer strangeness, a near-miss magnum opus from another era, before the cult of Tolkien went Hollywood."
m/lord_of_war," The story and characters are vivid and compelling, although the film is far too dense for its own good."
m/lords_of_chaos," Though a little overdone in places, Lords of Chaos is a fascinating, suitably bleak window into a most infamous and disturbing corner of music history."
m/lords_of_discipline," a fairly effective thriller, although it sometimes feels a bit mean-spirited and sadistic"
m/lords_of_dogtown, Lords of Dogtown will have limited interest for those who exist outside of the skateboarding community.
m/lore," Lore is an impressionist survival film and an existential war film, and also something truly singular and remarkable."
m/lorenzos_oil," It takes a heartbreaking story and pushes it to the limit, showing us the lengths of courage and imagination that people can summon when they must."
m/lornas_silence," The Dardennes have again made a movie with real moral ideas. It asks us to take seriously the idea of evil, and of redemption and turning aside from evil. But the vehicle for these ideas is a convoluted film whose narrative machinery simply seizes up."
m/loro_2019," A richly inventive, ferocious feast of satire and vulgarity."
m/los_angeles_plays_itself," Mr. Andersen takes movies involving his hometown as his subject, his source of evidence, and the target of a thought-provoking if sometimes crabby indictment."
m/los_ojos_de_julia," Yes, it's overlong but Del Toro acolyte Rueda brings some much atmosphere and suspense that you'll barely notice."
m/losing_control_2011, The tepid indie feelgood romcom follows a too familiar formulaic storyline to hold my interest.
m/losing_isaiah," The movie, directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal and written by Naomi Foner, deals with all of those issues, but in a finally unsatisfactory way."
m/loss_of_a_teardrop_diamond," There's retro, and then there's better left safely in the past.... [D]isjointed and ultimately histrionic..."
m/lost-for-words-2009, It's curious that the only conflict mined from this bicultural relationship is strictly linguistic.
m/lost_and_delirious, Rich lesbian jilted by boarding-school roommate in a surprisingly dramatic film with stunning acting by Coyote Ugly's Piper Perabo.
m/lost_and_found_2019," [A] lightweight, cheaply made portmanteau comedy from Ireland."
m/lost_angels_skid_row_is_my_home," An absorbing, at times heartbreaking look at several former and current denizens of downtown L.A.'s Skid Row ..."
m/lost_boys," The Lost Boys is not a movie you want to put in a time capsule or even revisit, unless your name happens to be Corey."
m/lost_boys_of_sudan, Lost Boys of Sudan is an excellent documentary about the struggles of two African youth to adapt to their new life in America.
m/lost_boys_the_tribe," As if the world needed another reason to celebrate The Lost Boys, The Tribe, and every second of its bumbling uselessness, just made me want to hug Joel Schumacher's film even tighter."
m/lost_child_2018," The slow-burning thriller walks a fine line, balancing elements of psychological drama and the supernatural, with a surging undercurrent of social commentary that sneaks up on you."
m/lost_girls_2020," The intention to show how the justice system failed these forgotten women is honorable, but the dramatic execution is lacking."
m/lost_highway," [Lynch] knows how to put effective images on the screen, and how to use a soundtrack to create mood, but at the end of the film, our hand closes on empty air."
m/lost_horizon," A thought-provoking drama that's worth watching if for no other reason than to be aware of this culturally significant film. It did, after all, give us the name 'Shangri-La,' which has since become synonymous with a utopian paradise on earth."
m/lost_in_america, New Yorkers have Woody Allen. Middle America has Albert Brooks.
m/lost_in_america_2020, What really stood out to me was his connection with the street kids... I just felt like it was heart wrenching.
m/lost_in_la_mancha," A frank and fascinating spectacle, as one man's 10-year cinematic odyssey painfully disintegrates."
m/lost_in_paris," Rather than reinventing the wheel, Abel and Gordon keep turning it with their own intimate touch."
m/lost_in_space, The main failing in the picture is not the pathetic script but instead is the way they blow it with the robot.
m/lost_in_thailand," By our quote-unquote standards of contemporary comedy, it plays as uneven at best and often just flattens out for long jokeless stretches."
m/lost_in_the_sun_2015," Despite some scenic territory, there's just not much to this journey, leaving ""Lost in the Sun"" feeling like a short story stretched way too thinly toward feature length."
m/lost_in_translation, The film's characters see their every disaffection hauntingly reflected onto the sounds and landscapes of the city they inhabit.
m/lost_in_yonkers, The pic seems too calculating and doesn't have the same stunning effect as the play.
m/lost_river_2015," It's the work of a surprisingly confident and experimental young filmmaker, even if he's not yet confident enough to move beyond his influences."
m/lost_skeleton_of_cadavra," The score, costumes, sets and intentionally bad, exposition-heavy dialogue (delivered in either cool deadpan or borderline-hysterical readings) are a deft mix of campy spoof and finely shaded replication."
m/lost_soul_the_doomed_journey_of_richard_stanleys_island_of_dr_moreau," Whether you remember the actual movie or not, ""Lost Soul"" is an excellent dissection of a multi-million-dollar movie gone off the rails."
m/lost_transmissions," ""Lost Transmissions"" is a murky and unfocused journey, set in a Los Angeles that looks as sodden as London on an overcast day."
m/lost_weekend," The Lost Weekend (1945) is a serious, painful and uncompromising, frank look at alcohol addiction that follows almost five days ('one lost weekend') in the life of a chronic, tortured alcoholic, and failed writer. The dark-tempered, melodramatic..."
m/lost_world_jurassic_park," Lost World is a movie that takes the viewer on one of the most pleasurable rides you're ever likely to embark upon, without insulting your intelligence in the process."
m/lot_like_love," The movie's biggest surprise is in how well casting works. As Oliver, Ashton Kutcher is, for a change, adorable rather than annoying and irresistible rather than irritating."
m/lou_andreas_salome_the_audacity_to_be_free, A thoroughly absorbing look at key points in the life of the first female psychoanalyst.
m/louder_than_a_bomb_2010," It's about, kind of, this community, and the way these groups come together."
m/louder_than_bombs_2016," It's maybe a little too diffuse to have the emotional impact Trier is after, but there's half of a great movie in here."
m/louder_than_words," Louder Than Words obviously means well, but its brand of cheap uplift is the kind of cheese that actually breeds cynicism."
m/loudquietloud_a_film_about_the_pixies," Boring people who made extraordinary music, the Pixies are inexplicable. In attempting to demystify them, this backstage pass to their 2004 reunion tour achieves the opposite."
m/louie_bluie," Louie Bluie peers into the areas where nothing is certain, except that these people live and strive and laugh and make music. It is a wonderful film."
m/louis_ck_2017," But if 2017 isn't quite as funny as Louis CK has been known to be, it is a fascinating exercise in pretending Trump never happened."
m/louise_bourgeois_the_spider_the_mistress_and_the_tangerine," Louise Bourgeois is absorbing, largely because of Bourgeois' striking art, prickly personality, and assured intensity."
m/loulou," This examination of class, love and sexual politics is full of nuanced observations of character, even as its narrative staggers and reels like a drunk negotiating a dark road."
m/love-and-other-drugs," Gyllenhaal and Hathaway, who played a couple in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" have a natural, likable chemistry. At least when it's allowed to shine."
m/love-sex-eating-the-bones," Sutherland's artful trick is to stick a serious tension -- sex objects versus love subjects -- into a genre flick without losing his balance, without sacrificing either the comedic levity or the thematic weight."
m/love_2015," Noé clearly wants to chart his own path, but as his movie chronicles that desire rather than realizing it, Noé mainly succeeds at broadcasting his intentions. That's an achievement in its own right, if not enough to make for a satisfying movie."
m/love_aaj_kal_2020," Whilst this limp remake/reboot/whatever suffers from a terrible script and bad performances that undercut the credibility of Aaryan and Khan as rising stars, it's made worse by a tedious length, zero moments of levity, and no exciting dance numbers."
m/love_actually," A roundly entertaining romantic comedy, Love Actually is still nearly as cloying as it is funny."
m/love_affair_1994," Love Affair is unapologetically sappy, but its old-school humility provides a lot of its considerable charm."
m/love_after_love_2018," Writer-director Russell Harbaugh's Love After Love is a remarkably cool-headed, composed piece of work."
m/love_and_basketball, One wishes producer Spike Lee had stepped in to give the dialogue some sass.
m/love_and_death, Stomps all over the games we play to pretend we're important
m/love_and_death_on_long_island," Unfortunately, Hurt is so good that almost everyone around him pales in comparison. Priestley just doesn't have the acting chops to play in the same scenes with him."
m/love_and_debt," Love & Debt manages to be funny without being cloying, highlighting the humanity of the characters even as they make confused, foolish, and all-too-understandable decisions in their increasingly stressful lives."
m/love_and_friendship," Jane Austen, who used dialogue as a veil that reveals and conceals, and writer-director Whit Stillman, with his love for the elegant pense, are such an obvious match that you wonder why it took them this long to get together."
m/love_and_honor_2013, 'Love and Honor' does not descend to the infantile humor and language of many films about this age group and class. It is better than one would expect.
m/love_and_mercy," You feel like you're right there in the studio with Brian Wilson as he creates Pet Sounds. It's a little like sitting next to Beethoven: the film is tender and moving, but also awe-inspiring."
m/love_and_other_catastrophes," All of these people are, of course, terminally cool about their sexuality. That's too bad, because a little uncertainty and doubt can make a great contribution to a comedy."
m/love_and_saucers," Abraham hasn't proved that aliens exist with his film, but he certainly makes you think about it."
m/love_and_sex," A simple, pleasing romantic comedy with a sharp tongue and a soft heart."
m/love_at_first_child," Just another love story that wasnt made in Hollywood, but it sure feels like it. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/love_at_first_fight," What matters in a movie like this is the relationship. Cailley understands that, and keeps his approach simple and transparent."
m/love_beats_rhymes," Despite its frequently clunky dramaturgy, the film makes some interesting points while providing an excellent showcase for Banks' considerable onscreen charisma."
m/love_crime, ...an utterly misguided (and surprisingly unwatchable) piece of work.
m/love_dont_cost_a_thing," You realize you're watching a snuff film, where the victim isn't just teen innocence but teen romance."
m/love_free_or_die," Macky Alston's raggedly structured docu duly honors his subject's conviction and courage, but largely sidesteps conflict and skirts the issues in an unrevealing talking-heads format."
m/love_gilda," Love, Gilda is a touching reminder of an iridescent star who shined brightly but for far too short a time. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll leave the theater wanting to dive down the YouTube rabbit hole of Gilda Radner."
m/love_guru," Not only does the film stumble badly from one skit to another, the skits themselves have too much dead air."
m/love_happens," Love happens in Love Happens, along with hearts, flowers, wine, roses, sweetness, light and every other cliche the filmmakers can squeeze into a two-hour film."
m/love_hunter," Love Hunter is consistently engaging, mainly thanks to its star's winning personality."
m/love_in_the_afternoon, Hepburn's performance represents precisely why the Hollywood studio system lasted as long as it did.
m/love_in_the_time_of_cholera," Artfully couched in surreal absurdity, its ironies are designed to question the contradictions and weaknesses of entrenched traditions."
m/love_in_the_time_of_money," Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life, the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine."
m/love_is_a_many_splendored_thing, This is basically a sappy story that does not hold up and that is so obviously designed to jerk tears that it seems more self-parody than love story.
m/love_is_all_you_need," A scrumptious romantic comedy set on the dazzling Italian Riviera and as a result, happily puts us through the emotional wringer. I laughed and I cried"
m/love_is_blind_2019," Love Is Blind is indeed the quirky romantic drama that the advertising suggests. ... In execution, however, it just doesn't fall into place in a manner befitting a clear and cohesive narrative."
m/love_is_strange_2014," This beautifully observed ensembler shines on the strength of its two leads, John Lithgow and Alfred Molina, who conjure four decades together as they enter the ""for better, for worse"" phase of their union."
m/love_is_the_devil, Looking through a color art book on Bacon actually would make an appropriate substitute to watching the film.
m/love_jones, The two leads click throughout in a movie that's just good enough to engender curiosity over filmmaker Witcher's follow-up effort.
m/love_liza," Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke, you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made."
m/love_marilyn," Fifty years after her death, the actress's corpse is still being picked over with ever-diminishing returns, as evidenced in Liz Garbus's garish, misguided documentary Love, Marilyn."
m/love_me_if_you_dare, It's either a life-long romance or a warning about how destructive unfulfilled loved can be. They dare you not to love it.
m/love_me_tender," one of Elvis' most compelling works, despite a forced, artificial ending."
m/love_n_dancing," If you cut the extraneous parts of Love n' Dancing -- you know, all the ones except for the dancing scenes -- it might not be a half-bad movie."
m/love_potion_no_9, It's not terrible for a film inspired by the popular song by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.
m/love_ranch," Helen Mirren's estimable talents are wasted in this soapy puddle, which is directed by her husband Taylor Hackford."
m/love_rosie, A thoroughly likeable English-language debut for German comedy helmer Christian Ditter ... elevated by vibrant visuals and the winsome chemistry of Lily Collins and Sam Claflin.
m/love_serenade, A quirky film that lances the mythology of romantic love.
m/love_simon," From a romantic standpoint, the most beautiful aspect of Love, Simon is that through nothing but emails it's believable that these two students could fall for one another; it's not about physical appearances or social status or anything superficial"
m/love_songs_2008, There's an overriding bleakness that drags the film down.
m/love_stinks," They called it right: this movie reeks, stinks, smells and destroys life as we know it with one olfactory destructive blast."
m/love_story," Sure, it's a shamelessly manipulative film. But it works, because it creates believable, likeable people, and you cry when terrible things happen to people you like."
m/love_streams," John Cassavetes's career of risk taking comes to a climax in this rich, original, emotionally magnificent 1984 film."
m/love_the_beast," Love the Beast is a solid film about car lovers, for car lovers. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them."
m/love_the_coopers," Enjoy the sense of never quite knowing when the movie is going to stick another pin in its balloon of sincerity, and you'll like the Coopers well enough."
m/love_the_hard_way," Full of bad dialogue, cheap locations, unbelievable situations and a lot of characters who have clearly spent too much time watching B-movies."
m/love_thy_nature," all too much of the message is laced with New Age ideas, some of which are actually dangerous."
m/love_wedding_marriage," If there is a special hell for film critics, it probably has movies like ""Love, Wedding, Marriage"" on continuous rotation."
m/love_wedding_repeat," At least the Italian scenery and the stranded actors look good. Just don't mistake this charmless, mirthless and shameless ripoff of 'Four Wedding and a Funeral' and 'Groundhog Day' for a comedy with actual laughs."
m/love_with_the_proper_stranger," The picture itself is diverting, but weak on that main romantic point."
m/loved_one," A wonderfully, witty satire, with Steiger's performance a riot."
m/lovelace, Call it Rashoporn if you like; it still feels like a superficial examination of an interesting time and subject.
m/loveless_2018, One of Loveless' great strengths is how it cannily withholds clear emotional involvement with its characters-only to set us up for one blindsiding salvo at the end.
m/lovely_molly_2011," Sanchez shows tremendous restraint in keeping it simple and in the end, rewards the audience with a haunting little film that's ultimately timeless."
m/lovely_still," Mr. Landau invests each move with sincerity and directness, and with her flawless skin and ageless smile, Ms. Burstyn still has the candlelit sweetness of spun sugar. Even in a disappointing film, watching her is indeed lovely, still."
m/lover," Annaud and his collaborators have got all of the physical details just right, but there is a failure of the imagination here; we do not sense the presence of real people behind the attractive facades of the two main actors."
m/loverboy_2006," Director Bacon gilds the inherent domestic horror of the script (by Hannah Shakespeare, from Victoria Redel's novel) with farcically stylized flashbacks."
m/loves_her_gun_2013," This is Marslett's first live-action film (his SXSW 2010 favorite, Mars, was animated), and it's a promising start."
m/loves_kitchen_2011, Gordon Ramsay must be the first man I've ever seen to be out-acted by his own hair transplant.
m/loves_labours_lost," Taken as a whole, the movie seems to be searching for a harmony it never really achieves."
m/lovewrecked, ...a low-rent comedic misfire that seems to have been geared exclusively towards teenaged girls.
m/loving_2016," Nichols stays true to his sensibility, avoiding the melodrama or the back-patting triumphalism you expect from such movies. Loving downplays the historical significance of its subject in favor of a quiet humanity."
m/loving_pablo," [Javier] Bardem and [Penelope] Cruz are powerful in front of the camera, but the histrionics can and do fail the film."
m/loving_vincent," The splendour of the artwork is not matched by the tale being told, which is of the paint-by-numbers variety."
m/low_down_2014," Fanning manages to bring soulfulness to a character who mostly reacts to others; you just wish the whole movie were, well, jazzier."
m/low_down_dirty_shame," In terms of action, Wayans the director relies too much on slow-motion in shooting action scenes -- a tiresome habit that undercuts the potential excitement of some sequences."
m/low_tide_2018," Despite a script that's as obvious as a treasure map, Low Tide ultimately works because of its leads"
m/lower_city," Another bracingly dynamic Brazilian drama that jolts us with raw authenticity, finding the universality of human experience in a violent, passionate setting."
m/lowlife_2018," Throughout its swirling stories, Lowlife does an impeccable job of teasing, pulling back, and delivering, whether it be violence, drama, or the intermittent moment of temporary joy."
m/lu_over_the_wall," Much more conventional than his far-out Night Is Short, Walk on Girl, Masaaki Yuasa's Lu Over the Wall still shows a highly individual approach to anime."
m/luce, A smart and sophisticated inquiry into race and class.
m/lucha_mexico," It aims to do for wrestling what the ""Magic Mike"" movies did for male stripping. But imagine a much slacker ""Magic Mike,"" without the fun or the social commentary."
m/lucia_lucia, A comedy-mystery that's neither funny nor mysterious.
m/lucky_2011_2," Lucky, unfortunately, is terrible: overbearing, obnoxious, and boring."
m/lucky_break, Suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry British filmmakers have strip-mined the Monty formula mercilessly since 1997.
m/lucky_day_2019, ... mostly an incoherent mess of testosterone-fueled clichés and disparate comic tones as it stumbles toward a predictable final showdown.
m/lucky_grandma," It's a joy to see Tsai Chin, who is now 85 years old, play the lead of an action-oriented gangster comedy set in New York City's Chinatown."
m/lucky_number_slevin," This mistaken-identity thriller delights in narrative complication and Tarantino-esque self-awareness; it's when the labyrinthine plot starts to make sense, ironically, that the pervasive shallowness becomes a liability."
m/lucky_numbers, A dark comedy in the muckraking mode that starts out murderously well but then begins to unravel -- just like Russ' misbegotten schemes.
m/lucky_them," A zany collection of colorful characters while concurrently probing scarred emotions and existential angst, nicely blending the daffy and dark sides of life. Along with the ambiguity of fame, and the essentials of existence that get lost in the process."
m/lucky_you," Not quite a Big Slick, but a pleasant, witty enough little flick with an engaging protagonist."
m/lucy_2014, Luc Besson makes an entertaining but often inane sci-fi action movie that mainly works due to Scarlet Johansson's presence on screen.
m/lucy_in_the_sky," The most frustrating thing about Hawley's telling isn't that it sidesteps the dirty truth, but rather that it doesn't create one of its own."
m/luis_and_the_aliens," A s a time-passer, it offers some shapeless fun for easily-amused kids."
m/lullaby_2013," Rarely has the terminal seemed as interminable as it does in Lullaby, writer-director Andrew Levitas's tedious saga of a family reuniting at the deathbed of their paterfamilias."
m/lultimo-cacciatore-the-last-hunterhunter-of-the-apocalypse, It does seem to take Mr. Granger an awfully long time to get around to freezing out Mr. Taylor. That's the way sermons sometimes go.
m/lulu_on_the_bridge, I just got the feeling Auster didn't know too much more about this mystery than the viewer did.
m/lumumba," Raoul Peck's detailed telling of the Machiavellian maneuverings proves gripping and haunting, with a resonant performance by Eriq Ebouaney as the charismatic leader."
m/lunch," Ingratiating, if too short, record of a Hollywood institution anyone would be happy to attend."
m/lupin_iii_the_castle_of_cagliostro, Rather crudely animated and a lot more lifeless than you'd think.
m/lured, A lustrous essay on the alluring trapdoors of the romantic image
m/lust_caution," Setting and wardrobe are relatively simple but immaculate. Less complication would have benefited the film, but perhaps the (female) heart is unknowable."
m/lust_stories," Manisha is excellent throughout and comes across as a real woman wanting a meaningful, fulfilling relationship."
m/lustre," Shot in the 12 months following 9/11, Jones' love letter to New York is an insider's game through and through."
m/luv_2011," The ideas of good/bad, past/future, reality/fantasy are impressively tackled and embodied by the talented cast, but Candis's narrative starts to lose steam halfway through, causing these performances to lose their footing as well."
m/lying_and_stealing," It's like they made Ocean's 11, but made it Ocean's 2 and didn't care."
m/lymelife," ""Lymelife"" is a black comedy that sticks in your throat a little too much to be an enjoyable experience. However, it does have the side effect of making its audience feel superior to the characters on the screen."
m/m_butterfly," All of this is interesting, in its way, and yet the film of M. Butterfly does not take hold the way the stage play did."
m/ma, A bold and unique film that has 'personal' written all over it. No one else could have made it.
m/ma_2019," Ma is an entertaining film (though it did feel long, despite being less than 100 minutes), but don't go in hoping for a twisty story or shocking moments. There just weren't any."
m/ma_vie_en_rose," The movie is about two ways of seeing things: the child's and the adult's. It shows how children construct elaborate play worlds out of dreams and fantasies, and then plug their real worlds right into them."
m/macGruber, [While] not comedy gold MacGruber could be comedy pyrite which in the case of this scattershot genre is good enough for me.
m/macao," All the other ingredients, including Miss Russell's famed physique, are pretty much the same as have been tumbled into previous cheesecakes with Jane and Bob."
m/macarthur, A woefully overblown biography with a wooden Indian Peck as MacArthur. He poses instead of acts.
m/macbeth-1972," Macbeth is dark, malignant, shot through with the most upsetting and gut-wrenching violence you will ever see in a major-studio release."
m/macbeth_2015," The braw news is that Justin Kurzel - Australian director of the agreeably horrible Snowtown - has knocked together the most muscular, propulsive version yet seen."
m/machete," Trejo has one gnarled, weather-beaten mug, as if he had a staring contest with the sun - and won."
m/machete_kills," Robert Rodriguez creates a sequel precisely as gratuitous as his fake trailer-turned-real movie deserves - which is to say, it's both excessively graphic and utterly pointless."
m/machete_maidens_unleashed, Mr. Hartley has proven himself to be quite the excellent curator of globally tacky cinema.
m/machine_girl," Nonstop violence, gallons of spurting blood, outrageous humor (a kitchen scene is a hoot), extreme vomiting, a drill bra, human sushi and tempura, and other perversity."
m/machine_gun_preacher," This amazing true story is somewhat let down by workman-like direction, but Butler's performance, coupled with the undeniably powerful story make this worth watching."
m/machinist, ...one of the better movies that I've seen so far this year.
m/mad_as_hell_2014, There's a promotional bent to Mad As Hell that whiffs more of branding than rigorous documentary filmmaking.
m/mad_city, Mad City arrives with the last thing a movie about journalism needs -- last year's news.
m/mad_cowgirl," Slick and often incomprehensible, it certainly gives you your money's worth, if blood, gore and blasphemy are what you're buying."
m/mad_detective," Another very, very solid crime drama from Johnnie To and Wai Ka-fai."
m/mad_dog_and_glory," As in his previous films, McNaughton has an uncanny mastery over reality: this film -- the locations, the people, the emotions -- rings true."
m/mad_hot_ballroom," New York City fifth graders determinedly go through the paces of traditional ballroom dancing in this slight, charming documentary."
m/mad_love_2001, The film benefits from a phenomenal central performance by Lopez de Ayala.
m/mad_max," It's a tough and grimy little piece of cinema, full of ambiance ... and attitude, with occasionally inspired flourishes."
m/mad_max_2_the_road_warrior, Brute violence and a fascist mentality are the hallmarks of this Australian fantasy.
m/mad_max_beyond_thunderdome," Bartertown is convincingly detailed, and the fight in Thunderdome is thrilling, ludicrous stuff, goofy and thrilling at the same time."
m/mad_max_fury_road," The post-apocalypse hath no fury like a one-armed woman... George Miller pulls off a rarity in Hollywood blockbusters these days: A muscular action masterpiece built on practical effects, weighty and awe-inspiring."
m/mad_monster_party, Clunky but charming; the subject and animatronic effects helped inspire The Nightmare Before Christmas.
m/mad_tiger," In this uncritical look at the group and its music, directors Jonathan Yi and Michael Haertlein put the focus on the standard reality-TV repertoire like ""Making the Band."""
m/mad_to_be_normal," Tennant's performance is strong, and he gives energy to a script that jolts in different directions looking for focus."
m/madagascar, It's the four scheming penguins voiced by the movie's animators and director that run away with the show.
m/madagascar_3_europes_most_wanted_2012, Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted is a most welcome addition to summer and a great addition to a moneymaking franchise that seems as good as new.
m/madagascar_escape_2_africa," Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is pretty tame, but it knows how to keep its own turf tidy."
m/madagasikara," Madagascar is also devastatingly beautiful, not unlike Cam Cowan's documentary Madagasikara."
m/madame_2018," Bogged down by blatant stereotypes, wan banter, obvious observations about the intersection of class systems, and rote wisdom about having the strength to be yourself and forge your own path."
m/madame_bovary_2014," The first half is shot almost like a horror, all oppressive rumbling clouds and lashing of mist and shot of her back, suffocating corset laced up like a spine."
m/madame_curie," Surprisingly watchable, given its iffy subject matter."
m/madame_sata," In spite of all the cinematic finery and virtuosity, the hero and story are."
m/made," The checklist of local color is evident, but the movie looks wan and murky."
m/made_in_america_2013, Less music-stuffed but more conceptually ambitious than the average music doc.
m/made_in_dagenham, Told in an accessible and reassuringly crowd-pleasing way.
m/made_in_italy_2020," James D'Arcy makes a very solid filmmaking debut here with ""Made in Italy."""
m/made_of_honor, goes from dull to boring and then becomes actively annoying
m/madea_goes_to_jail," Perry's silly beyond 'belief' born again bully pulpit is thankfully upstaged by his former + size stripper bully protagonist. But the big treat is anger shrink sessions with Dr. Phil, no less, though Madea/Perry's gender grudges get a pass."
m/madeas_big_happy_family," [Perry has] recycled the same material so many times, it's starting to turn rancid."
m/madeas_family_reunion," Domestic violence, incest and greed are some of the issues that boil over in this sweet and sour comedy that adheres to theatrical guidelines that are seldom politically correct."
m/madeas_witness_protection," An agent of spiritual regeneration and showman, Perry's dramaturgy is as subtle as a Bible-thump, but until a logy last act that has Levy disguised as a faux-Frenchman, his instincts are on-target here."
m/madelines_madeline," Anyone who has ever taken an acting class and witnessed the psychodramas brewed there will relate to this bubbling kettle of raw, unleashed emotions stirred up in shifting power grabs."
m/mademoiselle_c_2013, Mademoiselle C succeeds in showcasing the rarified entity that is Carine Roitfeld...but it's ultimately more of a fawning love letter than a nuanced profile of a woman who surely must be more fascinating than she comes off here.
m/mademoiselle_chambon," A simple story about a small-town French romance elevated by remarkable acting, clever dialogue, good music."
m/madeo," A superb murder mystery, with twists coming thick and fast yet always at the right moments."
m/madison," Near-comic predictability, 'What else could go wrong?' plotting and cliche-ridden screenplay sink it."
m/madman_1981," Fits the '80s slasher blueprint to the letter. It's only adequately made, but it happens to feature a handful of scenes so knee-slappingly bad that the film ranks as a party favorite."
m/madness_in_the_method," Shamelessly self-indulgent film-as-therapy for director-star Jason Mewes, Madness in the Method will fitfully entertain Askewniverse fans, though it's ultimately too scattershot to consistently satisfy."
m/madness_of_king_george," For those who, like myself, were disappointed in the play, the film contains pleasant surprises, all of them resulting from differences between the two arts."
m/madonna_truth_or_dare, Revealing for those who which to revel in Madonna's visage.
m/madrid_1987_2012, Miguel uses her beauty and placid demeanor as a screen against which to project his memories of past adventures and the ghost of his libido.
m/madwoman_of_chaillot," He's taken Jean Giraudoux's late 1940s play, jacked it up with some easy references to nuclear testing and radical students, and attempted to pass it off as relevant."
m/maestro_2005," A passionate but messy home movie that looks back at the multicultural, mostly gay underground dance movement in New York that coalesced in the early 1970's."
m/mafioso_1964," In Mafioso, the first film about the Mafia, Lattuada shows tremendous facility in blending comedy, tragedy, and pathos in a dark tale about the impact of family visit on a Sicilian from Milan, splendidly played by Alberto Sordi."
m/magdalene_sisters," An angry, bitter film certain to electrify audiences with its dramatic intensity."
m/maggie_2015," In a genre practically defined by fatalism, Maggie probably reigns supreme."
m/maggies_plan_2016," True to life, it's unpredictable and a bit of a mess. And that's what makes Maggie's Plan such a delight."
m/magic_flute," Even though there were moments in The Magic Flute when I wondered if Branagh hadn't truly gone off his rocker, I found its audacity exhilarating."
m/magic_in_the_moonlight," A muddled movie that delivers a gawky, unbelievable love story, tangled among a lazy intellectual debate, marinated in an abundance of sentiment and nostalgia."
m/magic_in_the_water, One of the problems with the first two-thirds of Magic in the Water is that we don't see Orky. One of the problems with the last third is that we do.
m/magic_magic_2013," Meticulously acted, gorgeously shot and hilariously insightful about the strange, inarticulable ways people can get on one another's nerves, this psychological thriller takes its premise to surprising, darkly comic extremes ..."
m/magic_mike," By way of remarkable sleight-of-hand, Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike both is and is not the freewheeling, fun-loving, male stripper extravaganza its trailers peddle."
m/magic_mike_xxl," If watching handsome men with perfect bodies perform suggested sex acts on obese women is appealing to you, go see ""Magic Mike XXL""."
m/magic_sword, [Estelle} Winwood provides some campy humor (I kept thinking of Bewitched every time she was on screen)...
m/magic_trip_2011," While the movie doesn't offer any new insights into the era, it is a trip to see the home movies they shot on the road and hear them reminisce about their experiences."
m/magician_the_astonishing_life_and_work_of_orson_welles," Director Chuck Workman's simply compiles Welles's greatest moments, offering little in the way of an authorial point of view."
m/magnificent_obsession, ...a fairly outrageous premise that's employed to predictably melodramatic effect by Sirk...
m/magnolia," An intricate mosaic of emotional stories intertwined by coincidence, Magnolia is an elegant expos of human frailty."
m/magnum_force, An enthralling thriller which resounds like the boom of the Magnum force
m/maid_in_manhattan, The fantasies of Cinderella and the American dream are joined and buffed up for unsure romantic results.
m/maiden," While Maiden is satisfying on its own, it's tailor-made for a remake that can dive deeper into a story that has so much life left in it."
m/maidentrip," If it at times, the movie ends up communicating the boredom of such an isolated endeavour, that's necessarily a criticism."
m/mail_order_wife, [A] hilarious black comedy... all about puncturing balloons of self-importance...
m/main_street," There's something interesting here at the core of the conflict, but the story is offered so little room to breathe, coming across rushed and undercooked."
m/maine," It's a sad and romantic notion, but the characters in Matthew Brown's (""In the Treetops"") Maine are sad and romantic people. In fact, that's all they are for much of this spare, outdoorsy story."
m/majestic," The Majestic finds a presumptuous Darabont openly vying for Capra cred and, well, succeeding."
m/major_dundee," Charlton Heston is the cavalry officer assigned to eliminate Apache resistance; Peckinpah makes a fine, ironic use of his stentorian presence in what becomes a very grubby context."
m/major_league," No classic, but it is a good example of the way light formulaic genres can be exploited for a little fun and a bunch of cheap laughs."
m/major_payne," Although the plot of the movie is a familiar formula, the dialogue and performance are not; it's a smart, funny job of poking fun at all those movies where sadistic drill instructors terrorized their green recruits."
m/make_believe_2011," This tension between self-expression and professional advancement is fascinating material, but first-time director-editor J. Clay Tweel avoids the nuance that might have brought it to life."
m/make_it_happen," It's all just filler between the dance scenes, which are admittedly fun. Think Pussycat Dolls with slightly more clothes on. Unrepentantly formulaic, but enjoyable all the same."
m/make_out_with_violence_2009," The film invests in spacey horror tropes one moment, plunges into absurdist adolescent angst the next and begs questions every step of the way, but just about holds together."
m/make_the_yuletide_gay," It's old news that American queer cinema is splintered between movies with serious artistic and intellectual aspirations and those which, like the bulk of contemporary pop culture, are aggressively mediocre."
m/make_your_move_2013," A soapy, flashy confection that juxtaposes Mr. Hough's tap dancing with the Japanese drumming style Taiko, tossed with liberal helpings of contemporary hip-hop moves."
m/making-the-boys, An impassioned evaluation of the cultural footprint of a landmark play considered both revolutionary and retrograde.
m/making_babies," In his debut feature film, writer/director Josh F. Huber tackles the issues of infertility head-on in the dramedy Making Babies, making sure to retain the humor and heart present in our everyday struggles."
m/making_montgomery_clift," Making Montgomery Clift may be co-directed by a member of the Clift family, but nothing feels sanitised; in digging deeper to find the man behind the cautionary tale, Clift and Demmon have crafted something far richer than any fanmade biography."
m/mala_noche," A very well-made movie, terse and to the point, nicely photographed by John Campbell and written and directed by Mr. Van Sant with sardonic humor."
m/maleficent_2014," In building a fresh mythology, director Robert Stromberg has made a fairytale not only of darkness, but of hope, and not only of good vs. evil, but of the goodness that even those seen as evil are capable of possessing."
m/maleficent_mistress_of_evil," Think twice about taking very young children - or even some susceptible adults - to this at-times shocking, if less than graphic, gloom-and-doom fest. But the worse sin is: It's boring."
m/malevolent_2018, ...as ineffective and monotonous a horror effort as one can easily recall...
m/malibus_most_wanted," No more than a benign time-waster, not consistently funny enough to recommend, but the fact that it isn't the horror its trailers suggested is itself a relief."
m/malice, One of the most trashily enjoyable medical thrillers out there.
m/malice_in_wonderland-2009, Genuinely original interpretation of the Brit gangster and Lewis Carroll's surreal tale.
m/mallrats," A disjointed but infectious series of comic vignettes, toilet humor, practical jokes, sight gags, even a sort of grunge variation on Keystone Kops slapstick."
m/mama_2013," What's under the bed? Who's behind that door? What's making those vaguely satanic noises? These and other thought-provoking questions are entertained in Mama, a visually polished but overly repetitive chiller."
m/mamas_boy," When the writer's this far off, the actors and the audience pay the price."
m/mambo_italiano," The sort of stand-up, one-liner, canned laughter sitcom that, unaccountably, the public finds irresistible."
m/mambo_kings, Terrific music and a boatload of high energy can't quite compensate for a thin plot and weak characterizations....
m/mamma_mia," Cute, clean, camp fun, full of sunshine and toe tappers."
m/mamma_mia_here_we_go_again," A joyful, blissed-out summer treat so sunny that audiences should apply SPF 30 before entering the theater."
m/man_about_town," O desfecho, em sua nsia de amarrar a narrativa com uma mensagenzinha engrandecedora, soa falso e no faz jus ao restante do filme, que utiliza muito bem o humor para desenvolver personagens quase sempre interessantes."
m/man_apart," Action-packed but slower than a simmering chook, ""Dominion"" takes what reads like the latest Steven Seagal movie and marries it with heart pounding music and lots of Diesel-like commotion to have an audience feel they're' actually watching something a lot"
m/man_bites_dog, a strikingly original satire carried out with unbelievable deadpan humor
m/man_called_horse, A test to see how much pain its hero and the audience can take before yelling Uncle.
m/man_camp_2020," A committed cast and a solid undercurrent of pathos elevate the film, effectively preventing it from becoming too broad."
m/man_down," An admirable, but muddled attempt to present a new perspective on the mental damage of war, showing it both from inside and outside one soldier's wrecked mind."
m/man_friday," The movie talks itself out, trying to resolve its situation with words and yet never finding a dramatic way to handle it."
m/man_from_elysian_fields," A sharp, smart and robustly engaging film about a man at the end of his rope and his struggle to avoid hanging himself with it."
m/man_from_nowhere_2010, The Man From Nowhere is relatively solid throughout and despite its general lack of originality it is an entertaining and gripping film with assured direction and excellent central performances.
m/man_from_plains," Demme subtly portrays Carter's love affair with wife Rosalynn, and succeeds where Carter's book failed -- expertly and objectively making a movie that is provocative without being divisive."
m/man_from_snowy_river," The Man from Snowy River is worth a small ""yippee!"" It's a real honest-to-goodness western, the likes of which haven't been seen in these parts for a long spell."
m/man_in_camo," [Ethan Minsker's] story is vibrant, his tale captivating. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/man_in_red_bandana, An emotionally devastating documentary [...] falls apart toward the end when it loses all objectivity and descends into hagiography.
m/man_in_the_gray_flannel_suit," The film may seem mediocre now (it did back then), but it probably speaks volumes about the period, and Bernard Herrmann composed the score."
m/man_of_aran," Robert Flaherty's film, Man of Aran, follows a similar formula as his Nanook of the North, and probably includes just as much fakery. I"
m/man_of_la_mancha," Here's a musical that's supposed to be some kind of affirmation of human hope, and all it really does is encourage whistling in the dark. What's worse, it does so with words and ideas that would embarrass a Dale Carnegie instructor."
m/man_of_tai_chi, An adequate and ambitious effort from a first-time director who could have enhanced his on-screen philosophical arguments with a bit more depth and done with a touch less of the admittedly riveting man-to-man melee.
m/man_of_the_house, Sharp instructs the girls on the evils of term-paper plagiarism and the importance of dressing to cover their navels.
m/man_of_the_year, There's nothing about Man of the Year that's quite as fantastic as its depiction of moribund Saturday Night Live as culturally and politically relevant.
m/man_on_a_ledge, Corny banter distracts from tension in this implausible thriller.
m/man_on_fire, Its callous fixation on violence is merely a lame pose meant to distract us from its soggy redemptive core.
m/man_on_wire," It is one of the most suspenseful, white-knuckled films of the year."
m/man_push_cart, Bahrani and his DP Michael Simmonds illuminate the murky beauty -- and hardscrabble economics -- of New York's all-night shadowland.
m/man_up_2015," A thoroughly enjoyable, delightfully honest movie, with a smattering of brilliantly witty lines."
m/man_who_fell_to_earth, It isn't so much the lightness of being that is unbearable as the gravity of its entropy.
m/man_who_knew_too_little, ...a misguided and terminally unfunny disaster that's rarely as appealing or entertaining as star Bill Murray's typically charismatic performance.
m/man_who_shot_liberty_valance," Superb John Ford--a western classic--with strong Wayne, Stewart, Marvin in tow."
m/man_who_wasnt_there," Digs under the Norman Rockwell portraits to show the venality, chicanery, and cupidity of our country."
m/man_who_would_be_king, Caine and Connery are terrific in this rousing adaptation of the Kipling story.
m/man_with_a_movie_camera," It's a startlingly avant-garde cross-examination of modern life, as well as a lesson in the power of filmmaking and an autopsy of its methods."
m/man_with_one_red_shoe," Not up to the original version, but it has its moments."
m/man_with_the_golden_gun, Moore tries hard to be tough and cool in the Connery manner. ...he comes off pretentious and cold.
m/man_without_a_past," Though his engagement of silent idiom recalls Chaplin, his leisurely pacing brings to mind Jarmusch."
m/management," ...screenplay is not punchline-jokey, but veined with moments of off-balance humor...Zahn and Aniston have unusual and slightly fizzy chemistry."
m/manakamana, A documentary about a cable car route that teaches us how incredibly rich and varied the sameness in our lives can really be.
m/manborg," Manborg's success in this regard has a lot to do with actor Matthew Kennedy, who plays the super cyborg with a kind of dorky pathos that's ripped straight out of a more innocent time in our pop culture history."
m/manchester_by_the_sea," Manchester by the Sea plants a lot of seeds, but it doesn't grow."
m/manchurian_candidate," Absolutely riveting entertainment, a chilling portrait of human paranoia also posing as an engrossing and visually vibrant political thriller. This is one arresting film."
m/manda_bala," With an excess of excitable style, samba music, and heady, montage-driven metaphor that threatens to bury his film's key ideas, young-gun director Kohn So far, he's succeeded."
m/mandela_long_walk_to_freedom," For all its failings, there is one thing about ""Long Walk to Freedom"" that can't be denied: Idris Elba gives a towering performance, a Mandela for the ages."
m/manderlay, The filmmaker uses Dogville's formal devices to lesser effect and his boredom is contagious.
m/mandingo," too trashy to be good drama, but too dramatic to be good trash"
m/mandy-lane," All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (is) the best modern slasher flick since Scream. In fact, I like All the Boys Love Mandy Lane a little more than Scream -- All the Boys may be knowing and post-modern as it begs, borrows and steals from films like Prom Night,"
m/mandy_2018, Panos Cosmatos' Mandy...featur[es] some of the best Cage-isms in years.
m/manglehorn," The script would be sharper without subplots about returned love letters and the locksmith's glib son, yet the film is worth it for Pacino, especially in his scenes with a bank teller played by the great Holly Hunter."
m/manhattan," I recently saw Manhattan again, for perhaps the fifth time, and my absolute joy as I sat there surpassed any other Allen film in recent memory."
m/manhattan_melodrama," The drama may be clunky and old-fashioned, but once Melodrama gets rolling, it never stops engaging the viewer."
m/manhattan_murder_mystery," ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"" is an accomplished balancing act."
m/manhattan_night," Writer and director Brian DeCubellis bathes the screen in dark shadows and provides fluid pacing. If you like your entertainment pulpy - and don't mind swallowing cliches along the way - this ""Night"" is worth a look."
m/maniac_1980," Seen today, the movie has more in common with the grungy Times Square aesthetic of Abel Ferrara than with the multitudes of slasher flicks that followed it."
m/maniac_2013," This is down and dirty genre filmmaking, and the various slaughters, excruciatingly detailed scalpings and other atrocities are no less gruesome because of the highfalutin approach."
m/maniac_cop," Maniac Cop is still lots of fun for its ""let's see what we can get away with"" attitude."
m/manic_2003," The film doesn't really go anywhere, other than outside for endless games of basketball, and the group-therapy environment allows for far too many young-actor monologues."
m/manifesto_2017, Julian Rosefeldt's visual panache and Cate Blanchett's astonishing versatility bring cinematic verve to something that could've easily come off as too dryly conceptual.
m/manito, Eason balances the clichs of a fairly standard story with convincing realism and a powerful momentum that never flags.
m/manitou, Ack! There's an evil Indian demon growing on my neck!
m/mannequin_two_on_the_move, It took four writers to struggle with another idea of why a mannequin would come to life in a department store and what would happen if she did.
m/manny," Banal, stentorian narration by Liam Neeson (""Once victory is stolen from you, what are you left with?"") mostly gives the sense that it's the viewer being carried around the ring."
m/manolo_the_boy_who_made_shoes_for_lizards," Director Michael Roberts, a fashion writer by trade, has produced a fluff piece, albeit a pretty one."
m/manos-the-hands-of-fate," Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible."
m/mans_best_friend_1991," A smart dog turns from friendly to killer. Like 'Old Yeller' with gore, and a really crummy plot."
m/mans_favorite_sport, Outdoorsman-columnist Rock Hudson suddenly finds he has to live up to his reputation in this 1964 Howard Hawks comedy that's funnier than it has any right to be.
m/mansome, A frustratingly frothy film that says nothing about its subject.
m/manson_family," The film accomplishes the near-impossible, conjuring up and maintaining an unremittingly bad vibe that speaks wordless volumes about the Family's evolution from sex-driven hippie commune to the drug-fueled slaughter machine."
m/manson_family_vacation," Unexpected and charming, Manson Family Vacation is one ride you'll want to catch."
m/manthing, One comics adaptation that comes with a few key panels missing.
m/manufactured_landscapes," Polemic-free, yet undeniably frightening -- and weirdly beautiful in its depiction of industrial ugliness."
m/manuscripts_dont_burn, A slow-motion explosion of anti-authoritarian rage.
m/manxman, The stern morality melodrama contains very little of the filmmaking techniques that would later make Hitchcock a master of his craft.
m/many_adventures_of_winnie_the_pooh," Their charm is undeniable, though it mainly resides in the source material: the late 60s, when these were made, were Disney's darkest days for craft and commitment."
m/maos_last_dancer," This is a film that seems afraid to show its claws, and for me, it's a real pity."
m/map_of_the_human_heart," Map of the Human Heart is an enjoyable two-hour ride, an unusual and eccentric combination of old-fashioned and modern movie sensibilities, told from a decidedly '90s mindset."
m/mapplethorpe," This is an honest film above all else. It doesn't excuse Mapplethorpe's transgressions, but it manages to celebrate his work in spite of them."
m/maps_to_the_stars," The film doesn't quite get away with its attempt to reconcile satire with pathos, but it comes perilously close."
m/mara_2018," The locations in Savannah, Georgia are atmospheric, but there is much clumsy exposition and some very lazy 'boo!'-type scares."
m/marathon_man, Stylish thriller with a classic Olivier performance
m/marathon_the_patriots_day_bombing_2016," Marathon: The Patriots Day Bombing is both a comprehensive look at the reprehensible act of terrorism at the worldwide event, but a deeply human one, that follows a trio of families... even as they try to move past it."
m/marauders_2016, A hyper-convoluted heist movie that's every bit as generic as its title might suggest.
m/marc_maron_too_real," ... Maron knows his fans want more, expect more now out of him."
m/marc_pease_experience, Consider: A bad movie about cheesy a cappella and awful musical theater. What could be more excruciating?
m/march_of_the_penguins, The inventive use of well-written and acted voice-overs and the technical sleekness of this work makes one hungry for more.
m/march_of_the_wooden_soldiers," A delightful treasure, especially in its uncut, original Babes in Toyland release."
m/marci_x," Marci X is silly, crude, juvenile and often very, very funny."
m/mardi_gras_made_in_china," This sly, engrossing doc is an expert riposte to smug proponents of the fetterless free market."
m/marebito," It's just a little too interesting for its own good, a fascinating setup that leads to multiple conclusions -- none of them satisfying."
m/marfa_girl, The film finds the actors' performance deficiencies functioning less as signs of authentic teenage behavior than as an incompetent carrier of plot.
m/margaret_2010, A distanced but often car-crash compelling portrait of a teen as an unfinished being.
m/margin_call, The film WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS should have been.
m/margot_at_the_wedding," Baumbach knows exactly what he's doing, and it works."
m/marguerite_and_julien," It finds its filmmaker completely lost between impulses to pay homage, play it safe, or offer something--anything--new."
m/maria_bamford_old_baby," The beauty of their domestic setting is that it's imbued with context, from the painting of their dog to the little bride-and-groom figurines resting atop the couch. This feels like any old day for them, just hanging out and goofing around."
m/maria_by_callas, [A] respectful documentary. [Full review in Spanish]
m/maria_full_of_grace," From one part of the world to another, Maria Full of Grace swirls with movement and stirs us with its torrents of feeling."
m/mariachi_gringo, A road trip movie filled with simple pleasures. Ashmore does a solid job as a mariachi musician without a single grenade-launcher in his guitar case.
m/marianne_and_leonard_words_of_love," Marianne & Leonard - Words of Love is a tender, delicate and intimate portrait of a love which never really died."
m/marie_curie_the_courage_of_knowledge_2017," While the drama could have been more engrossing and substantive, the evocative period detail greatly enhances Noelle's selective and intimate portrait of a loving wife, mother and workaholic."
m/marigold," Marigold is saved from the predictability of its setup by the enthusiasm of its cast, color-drenched sets and costumes, and full-on musical numbers staged outdoors on a beautiful seaside stage."
m/marilyn_hotchkiss_ballroom_dancing_and_charm_school, Shows how dancing becomes a route to personal transformation for a man mired in mourning.
m/marina_abramovic_the_artist_is_present_2012, How do you react when you walk through an entryway between a naked man and woman standing less than a foot a part ... and where do you put your hands?
m/marine," It's as fast and loud as you'd expect, but where it catches you off-guard is in its breathtaking stupidity."
m/marion_bridge," Defies its genealogy with grace, economy, and unstinting compassion."
m/marjoe, [Its] performances thrum with the ecstatic energy of rock.
m/marjorie_prime, As much a small story about family and loss as it a grand discourse on human recollection.
m/mark-of-the-devil," Though the Pioneer is reviving this picture's original barf-bag-at-the-door promo gimmick, there's about a 50 percent chance it'll be more useful to save it for watching the returns on Election Night."
m/mark_felt_the_man_who_brought_down_the_white_house," Unfortunately, Felt's actions, while historically important, don't exactly make for riveting drama, especially compared to a classic about two dogged reporters."
m/marked_for_death, Seagal looks like James Belushi on steroids and talks in a whisper but is convincing in his martial arts moves.
m/marked_woman, Bristling crime drama torn from the day's headlines.
m/marketa-lazarova," Director Vlacil does not try to romanticize medieval knighthood but creates an atmosphere of mysticism and superstition, with excellent results."
m/marlene_1984," The bilingual parrying between the withholding diva and her frustrated chronicler often seems like Sunset Boulevard re-imagined as a radio play, with sex removed from the equation but marlenus interruptus aplenty."
m/marley, Such an honest depiction can only contribute to a deeper appreciation of this remarkable artist.
m/marley_and_me," Here, there's no great momentum, just a long, flat arc toward the inevitable."
m/marlowe, We don't care what happens next because we don't understand what happened before. Marlowe becomes enjoyable only on a basic level; it's fun to watch the action sequences
m/marmaduke, The first of many instances of doggy-doo humor comes about three minutes into the film.
m/marnie," Marnie is the character study of a thief and a liar, but what makes her tick remains clouded even after a climax reckoned to be shocking but somewhat missing its point."
m/marooned, I suspect these distinctly disillusioned effects go with endeavours to inject human interest into a basically mechanistic movie. Where the human interest leads is another question.
m/marquise_of_o, A fascinating and sympathetic portrait of an abused woman is given life and depth by Rohmer's eloquent direction.
m/marriage_italian_style," A good deal soapier and ultimately less satisfying than De Sica's previous collaboration with Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow, but it's still effectively heart-rending."
m/marriage_story_2019," Marriage Story is enriching for all its weary insight, for the intricate ways it maps two personalities and locates them in the world."
m/married_to_the_mob," The cast is superb - especially Mercedes Ruehl in over-the-top mode as Stockwell's brassy, jealous wife - and Demme keeps both the action and the laughs perfectly tuned."
m/married_woman," A continuous, penetrating dance of misogyny and feminism"
m/marrowbone, A few brushes with satisfactory filmmaking craft is a moot thing to champion in a film this mucked up.
m/marrying_man," Your basic, everyday boy-meets-girl, boy-marries-girl, boy-divorces-girl, boy-marries-girl-again, boy-divorces-girl-again, boy well, you get the idea."
m/mars_attacks," A holiday film with no conscience whatsoever, Mars Attacks! will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it definitely will make you wonder about Earth's ability to defend itself in the face of higher life forms."
m/mars_needs_moms," Enhanced by nimble ad-libbing from the comedy-trained cast, the screenplay is delightful, by turns funny and emotional..."
m/mars_needs_women, It was as bad as I thought it would be and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
m/marshall," It's not at all anomalous to see it on a theater screen. In fact, it's an extremely pleasurable anachronism from a movie era where theater audiences would often be expected to be serious-minded adults in search of hero stories."
m/marshland," ""Heat and oppression hang in the air like an unspoken accusation."""
m/martha_marcy_may_marlene, A sensitive treatment of a sensational subject that heralds the arrival of talented tyro Sean Durkin behind the camera and promising new star Elizabeth Olsen.
m/martian_child, Knockout performances by John Cusack and child actor Bobby Coleman help legitimize a whimsical but sententiously moralizing script.
m/martin_and_orloff, An occasionally savvy farce that suffers from attention deficit disorder.
m/martin_lawrence_live_runteldat," Instead of letting the laughs come as they may, Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er, comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank, take your pick."
m/martyrs," Film should score OK with hardcore gore fans, but others will expect martyrdom for sticking it out until the end."
m/marvels_the_avengers," A continued run of quality can't be guaranteed, but all involved in The Avengers experiment should be proud they took on the challenge of redefining some significant pop culture icons, and, from 2008-2012, actually enhanced them."
m/marvins_room," An emotionally fulfilling film with wonderful, uplifting elements."
m/marwencol," Malmberg applies stylistic and structural tricks to create the most compelling portrait possible, reflecting a respectful but very different agenda from that of his subject."
m/mary-pickford-the-muse-of-the-movies," Muse Of The Movies is assembled with such thoroughness, respect and care you can't help but be awed by Pickford's remarkable achievements."
m/mary_2019," Mary comes to feel as if lacks a through line, collapsing into a series of disconnected horror-movie beats."
m/mary_and_the_witchs_flower," Director Yonebayashi clearly fetishizes the romantic countryside setting of such European stories for Mary's time with her family, the school itself is quite unlike anything we've seen, making it easy to understand why Mary might think she's dreaming."
m/mary_magdalene_2019," Mary Magdalene only snaps into focus as narrative when we get to Jerusalem, chiefly because it gives these kids something to physically rail against - moneylenders, Judas kisses, Romans, and all. It's a little on the late side, though."
m/mary_poppins," Sophisticated yet wide open to its audience, with exciting dance sequences and inviting performances."
m/mary_queen_of_scots," Although the film's palace intrigue gets a bit dense, the story never loses sight of its compassion for these characters and their shared plight of being held hostage by conniving, belittling, power-hungry men determined to usurp their authority."
m/mary_reilly," Those expecting a traditional horror film may be disappointed. However, for those with an open mind, and a taste for the eerie, Mary Reilly may well be one to watch."
m/mary_shelley," Elle Fanning is serviceable, but left undone by a story that doesn't give Mary an arc so much as a linear, Wikipedia style journey through her life."
m/mary_shelleys_frankenstein," The Creature is on target, but the rest of the film is so frantic, so manic, it doesn't pause to be sure its effects are registered."
m/maryam," Serry perfectly captures the peculiar climate, creating uncanny echoes with today's situation."
m/masai_the_rain_warriors," I quite enjoyed this ""Lord of the Rings"" style Masai adventure tale. It's in spoken Masai, subtitled in English. Authentic and warm."
m/mascots," The rewards are subtle but a bit too far in between; much of it feels familiar, which will bring both comfort and frustration to fans."
m/mash," Altman's black comedy perfectly expressed the anarchic, rebellious spirit of the 1970s with its blistering anti-war message and contempt for authority."
m/mask_of_zorro," Banderas' appeal alone may be just enough to win over some viewers; the waste of that appeal, and of the Man in Black's commanding image, made me long for some heroic figure to come along and make a few strategic slashes in the editing room."
m/masked_and_anonymous," With ""masked & anonymous"" the whole is less than the sum of its parts."
m/master_and_commander_the_far_side_of_the_world, It's 1805. Napoleon is master of Europe and Russell Crowe is master of the dessert tray
m/master_of_dark_shadows_2019, David Gregory's doc shows how Dan Curtis' Sixties TV series transformed both the soap opera & the vampire myth
m/master_of_disguise, The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor.
m/master_z_ip_man_legacy, Master Z: The Ip Man Legacy doesn't have much on its mind besides delivering on fights - and in that aspect it succeeds.
m/masterminds_2016," The movie's appeal boils down to this: do you want to see David consume a dead tarantula that squirts orange goo on first bite? If so, Hess's fascination with icky events will do the trick."
m/masters_of_the_universe," There are some decent special effects, but overall it's about what you'd expect from a movie inspired by a line of toys."
m/matador," Almodovar's early work is saltry, erotic, even perverse, but very seductive to watch"
m/match_2014, Patrick Stewart's performance is practically an argument for Belber to jettison everything else and take the actor on the road as a one-man spoken-word act.
m/match_point, Shot for shot the worst movie I have seen all year.
m/matchstick_men," Funny, sad, thoughtful and surprising, the greatest con Matchstick Men pulls is manipulating the audience into believing they know exactly what the film's all about."
m/material_girls, A superficial tween comedy that mocks celebutantes like the Olsen twins while simultaneously pushing stars Hilary and Haylie Duff as their replacements.
m/matrix, A lot of the fighting and shoot-out scenes are positively balletic and great fun to watch.
m/matrix_reloaded," Digital freedom from physical laws unleashes all manner of chase dynamics, exhilarating to the max... an action choreographer's dreamstate."
m/matrix_revolutions," The Wachowskis lay on the spiritual allegory thick, but the film's fragile, better-than-here hopefulness is genuinely unsettling."
m/matru_ki_bijlee_ka_mandola, Mixes Politics With Romance And Does Justice To Neither
m/matt_shepard_is_a_friend_of_mine," Josue's film is not consistently effective in bridging her personal story with Shepard's well-known legacy, but there are striking moments that explore the limits of forgiveness."
m/matthew_barney_no_restraint," [Director Alison] Chernick misses the chance to follow in the footsteps of documentarian Thomas Riedelsheimer, whose essential artist-at-work films Touch The Sound and Rivers And Tides meditate on the ephemeral nature of the creative act."
m/maudie," The sort of title you'd be thrilled to stumble across on the telly on a Sunday evening, but not one you'd necessarily need to indulge in on the big screen."
m/maurice," Maurice' paints a subtly scathing portrait of polite society, a portrait affording many opportunities for cameo acting triumphs."
m/maurice_richard," There's not much, finally, to lift this thing above its necessarily niche appeal."
m/mausam_2011," Fine performances, sophisticated cinematography and a melodious score give Mausam a universal appeal."
m/mauvais_sang, A work of a conscientious erudite who still has absolutely nothing to say. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/maverick," Affectionate, amiable, eager-to-please, in a TV-movieish sort of way."
m/mavis, Living legend Mavis Staples is fondly celebrated in Jessica Edwards' spirited biographical documentary.
m/max, Meyjes ... rewards adventurous filmgoers with a speculative fiction that makes connections and provokes ideas worth considering about the emotional makeup of this tyrant.
m/max_2016," Mr. Yakin opts for bullets, explosions and blood vengeance when handcuffs and perp walks would do the job. Not that ""Max"" has any clear or coherent sense of mission."
m/max_keebles_big_move, This one was truly funny. Full of imagination and creativity. Max is lovable and a bit mischievous all at the same time.
m/max_manus_man_of_war, So this overdue homage to Max Manus: Man of War is a powerful surprise.
m/max_payne," A big nothing, not even hokey enough to watch for the sake of laughing at it."
m/max_reload_and_the_nether_blasters, ... definitely popcorn entertainment perfect for a Saturday night with a few generations looking to watch a film together.
m/max_steel, Even bored adolescent boys are unlikely to muster any enthusiasm for this chintzy reboot of the hybrid hero.
m/maxed_out," A slapdash piece of work totally indebted to second-hand rhetorical strategies (the '50s educational film, glib Bush-bashing) and threadbare indignation."
m/maximum_impact_2018," ""Maximum Impact"" is a dopey international thriller that's fully aware of how dumb it is, This doesn't make it a good movie, but it does make it easier to sit through."
m/maximum_overdrive, This is why other people usually direct King's writing.
m/maximum_risk, So full of holes that exciting stunts can't cover them all.
m/may," Shivery and seductive, May is a delicious little creepathon."
m/may_in_the_summer," The drama never fully takes off, and the laughs are too few and far between to offset the film's fundamental deficiencies."
m/may_it_last_a_portrait_of_the_avett_brothers," But what ""May It Last"" never adequately explores is where that desolation and pain came from. The result is a celebration, without much in the way of revelation."
m/may_the_devil_take_you," I'll remember it, which I guess is ultimately the important thing!"
m/maya_the_bee_movie, Altogether the best exploration of Australian class conflicts through the medium of animated insects that you're likely to see this year.
m/mayhem_2017," For how much is going on, with nail guns and scissor-stabbings and one very unconvincing dislocated tongue, the chaos can feel as sterile as a Wednesday morning meeting."
m/maytime, Beautifully designed MacDonald-Eddy vehicle with the bonus of John Barrymore.
m/maze," Linney's finely calibrated, low-key performance as Callie goes a long way towards making it more interesting than it might otherwise be."
m/maze_2019," You will be riveted to your seat in what is a refreshingly authentic film, which has not one false note."
m/maze_runner_the_death_cure," Just when you think things are being wrapped up, they come unwrapped, and the picture goes on for another 40 minutes, prolonging your pain with a sadism that would make even the movie's sneering villain feel a bit guilty."
m/maze_runner_the_scorch_trials," A better sequel than expected, even if its mid-series stakes never truly seem serious."
m/mccabe_and_mrs_miller, That Altman is able to weave a reasonably poetic vision of early frontier life around...two reprobates is a minor accomplishment...
m/mccanick," Because Noah coyly reserves the motivation for McCanick's vendetta as a third-act twist of sorts, much of McCanick simply involves watching this tortured guy mowing people down for no apparent reason."
m/mcfarland_usa," A feel-good movie that earns all those good feelings, ""McFarland, USA"" might be running on a predetermined track, but the heart it shows along the journey is what makes it a winner."
m/mcq, Uma triste ironia do Cinema que a nica colaborao entre Sturges e Wayne tenha sido neste policial urbano medocre que j nasceu anacrnico.
m/mcqueen," We are left at the end with a need to know more, and a wish to do so, which may be one way of saying this documentary has done its job."
m/me_and_earl_and_the_dying_girl," This rousing adaptation of Jesse Andrews' novel is destined not only to connect with young audiences in a big way, but to endure as a touchstone for its generation."
m/me_and_you_and_everyone_we_know, Exceptionally Solondz-esque; incredibly impressive.
m/me_before_you," It may not quite rise to the level of a classic three-hankie tearjerker, but it's proof that sometimes one or two hankies is more than enough to get the job done."
m/me_myself_and_irene, This is a movie that will tickle every one of your personalities.
m/me_myself_i," Griffiths' career is humming right along, if the criteria are that she stars in good roles in interesting movies, and is able to use her gifts and her intriguing personality."
m/me_without_you," Offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love, loyalty and the nature of staying friends."
m/me_you_them, Waddington provides us with a valuable view into the lives of the 'real people' of the large coffee-producing country.
m/mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god, No one of true faith will get over Maxima Mea Culpa.
m/mean_creek," A fairly ordinary, machine-shopped Sundance résumé indie, seemingly balanced somewhere between half-realized ambition and inexperience."
m/mean_dreams," Morlando makes a concerted effort to inject dynamism and emotion into the telling of Mean Dreams, but fights a losing battle against the cliched writing and some risible plotting."
m/mean_girls, falls into the category of teen fare that's better than you'd expect
m/mean_machine," With a completely predictable plot, you'll swear that you've seen it all before, even if you've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard."
m/mean_season," Unsatisfying mix of ""Red Dragon"" and ""Absence of Malice"""
m/mean_streets," Scorsese gives us Catholic guilt, misguided loyalty and the urban nostalgia that would lead to such movies as Raging Bull and even New York, New York."
m/meantime," The first hour is given to aimless glimpses of aimless existences, and the second, in which Colin finds a sort of deliverance, is contrived in concept and awkward in execution."
m/measure_for_measure_2020," Paul Ireland's much anticipated follow-up to Pawno is just too cluttered, riddled with characters who wallow in their own histrionics far too often, within situations that lack any real distinctive qualities."
m/meatballs," Without Murray, it'd be nothing. Fortunately the comedian's in fantastic form here."
m/mechanic," It proves middling, and occasionally muddled, on almost every level."
m/mechanic_resurrection," For an actor who, with the ""Transporter"" films, once imbued the action genre with a new sense of possibility and winking sophistication, Mr. Statham is on cruise control."
m/medallion, Jackie Chan has finally jumped the shark - and he needed wires to do it.
m/medea_1969, Pier Paolo Pasolini's disappointing 1970 version of the Greek tragedy.
m/medicine_for_melancholy," Deeper, more thoughtful, and more satisfying than many low-budget first features."
m/mediterranea_2015, There's a specificity to Mediterranea that at times makes it feel like an actual documentary.
m/meeks_cutoff," Beautifully shot and impressively directed, this is a haunting, contemplative western with terrific performances from Bruce Greenwood and Michelle Williams, though Reichardt's relentlessly minimalist approach might prove hard going for some."
m/meet-the-browns2008, It would take a stony critic to dismiss entirely the movie's tribute to the virtues of perseverance and generosity.
m/meet_dave," If anything, this one is actually kind of sweet, and while I'll am positive I'll never sit through it ever again I certainly wouldn't begrudge anyone with children under 12 giving it a shot."
m/meet_joe_black, There's a solid 95-minute movie buried somewhere in here.
m/meet_john_doe, This vintage Capra film is the sort of sentimental thing that only he could get away with.
m/meet_me_in_st_louis," In the words of one of the gentlemen, it is a ginger-peachy show."
m/meet_monica_velour," From dirty-movie parodies to the achieving of one's misfit dreams, Keith Bearden's coming-of-age dramedy adheres to the flaccidest of formulas."
m/meet_the_blacks," Meet the Blacks is an asinine film (though with a kernel of seriousness) but whenever it feels like it is running out of steam, something strange and surreal will happen to elevate it above a typical spoof movie."
m/meet_the_fockers, This sequel to 2000's Meet the Parents knows that its audience expects a symphony of outrageousness. Anyone who resists is pummeled into submission by the sheer pace and volume of the comic antics.
m/meet_the_fokkens," To what degree the seductive senior siblings for sale are leveling with audiences is up for grabs, but certain truths vividly come into play. Namely, their refusal to act old, along with challenging the cultural norms of what it means to be beautiful."
m/meet_the_mormons," There's nothing in the movie about Mormon history, and no discussion of the unique aspects of LDS doctrine about which non-Mormons tend to be the most curious."
m/meet_the_parents," Within its formulaic confines, the humor works uncommonly well from time to time."
m/meet_the_patels_2014," ""Meet the Patels"" is warm and loaded with laughs, and it might even create some intercultural understanding. If only all our relationship woes could be so worthwhile."
m/meet_the_robinsons," Meet the Robinsons is a mess, and a sadistically uninspired one at that."
m/meet_the_spartans," Writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer basically reprise the tired formula from their earlier efforts, which is to throw in as many pop culture references as possible to cover up the lack of any real wit."
m/meet_wally_sparks, Dangerfield misfire comedy on several levels; little to smile about.
m/meeting_evil_2012," Chris Fisher so over-directs his material that the action takes on the sheen of a parody or, at least, of a film that doesn't realize its clichs are being exaggerated to the point of absurdity."
m/meeting_people_is_easy_1999," Meeting People Is Easy feels like a hangover with a great soundtrack. It's not for all tastes, but for those who crave experimental filmmaking, it's a must."
m/meeting_spencer, A screwball comedy without nearly enough zest or wit.
m/mega_piranha, I can't think of anything more dispiriting than a film consciously faking it for the so-bad-it's-good market.
m/mega_shark_vs_giant_octopus," Schlock may be an acquired taste, like caviar, foie gras, and Arby's, but it's hard to see how anyone wouldn't enjoy this extremely tacky dish."
m/mega_time_squad," A manic, light-hearted comedy about a nice young criminal who uses time-travel paradoxes to create a gang of himself (himselves?)... Absurd, childish, petty, seemingly dumb but actually clever."
m/megamind," Megamind manages to be both commentary and comic book, and I have no doubt audiences will eat it up."
m/megan_leavey," Pat and predictable, yet a sentimental enough journey to leave you weepy in spite of yourself."
m/mei_ren_yu," Chow and his actors present a full-force farce. Sure, some jokes fall flat, but the sheer magnitude of ridiculousness has you forgetting about that soon afterwards."
m/melancholia_2011," Von Trier avoids antagonizing the viewer with his usual gut-punch theatrics, settling down for a story about colliding worlds, breaking faades, and shifting alliances."
m/melinda_and_melinda, An invigorating return to the brainy but breezy New York story that reinvents the ways in which stories can be told cinematically.
m/melody_makers," Although a tad threadbare in the talking-head department (here comes Eric Burdon, again), this cheerful history of the British music weekly Melody Maker has enough inside dope to maintain interest."
m/memento, That rare film that needs -- and deserves -- second viewings. It's that unique.
m/memoir_of_war," If, at over two hours, it is an undeniably onerous watch, that is by design: Finkiel's film certainly understands the taxing nature of sorrow."
m/memoirs_of_a_geisha, You have to appreciate the attention to detail and the beauty imbued into every scene by Rob Marshall and his crew
m/memoirs_of_an_invisible_man," They couldn't go wrong with The Invisible Man could they? Yes, they could."
m/memoria_2016," Despite clocking in at a scant 70 minutes, the troubled-youth drama ""Memoria"" manages to make a hauntingly poetic impression."
m/memories_of_murder_2003, Memories of Murder offers a ruminative and affecting approach to a genre not known for its emotional content.
m/memories_of_the_sword, These actors keep Memories of the Sword watchable and give us faith that we'll see them in better projects.
m/memory_the_origins_of_alien," With its passionate contributors and lofty ideas, ""Memory: The Origins of Alien"" demonstrates that, if nothing else, the study of a film can be as exciting as the film itself."
m/memphis_2013, Sutton's sophomoric sophomore effort is a pseudo-existentialist excursion through the life of a nomadic singer struggling with artistic stagnation.
m/men_at_lunch_2012," The core image is striking, but it's not quite as ""iconic"" as claimed. The allusions to 9/11 are unnecessary. But Men at Lunch remains an honourable, worthwhile effort."
m/men_at_work_1990," In fairness to the two actors, who have appeared in much better films, they don't have much to work with here."
m/men_in_black," Men in Black has the right attitude toward movie technology: Get the most sophisticated special effects money can buy, and treat 'em like one of Ed Wood's paper-plate UFOs."
m/men_in_black_ii," A good-faith attempt has been made to duplicate the original elements, but the mix is wrong, bearings have been lost, the balance is off."
m/men_in_black_iii," Few things in life are worth waiting a decade for, and this isn't one of them, but after witnessing so many big-screen sci-fi comebacks go so hideously wrong in recent years, Men In Black 3 emerges as something of a triumph."
m/men_in_black_international," Nearly everything here reminds you of something else, often better, cleverer, funnier."
m/men_of_boys_town," Like its predecessor Boys Town, this one carries socko entertainment for wide general appeal, including plenty of tear-jerking and sentimental episodes to blur the eyes of the most calloused."
m/men_of_honor," ... could have been excellent if it was a story of real people, not simple and self-important one-dimensional characters."
m/men_who_stare_at_goats, An amusing film (albeit in spurts)... (although) Armando Iannucci's In the Loop is a hard act to follow for any politically-tinged comedy.
m/men_with_brooms," A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled, despite many charming moments."
m/men_women_and_children, A well-meaning but curiously anesthetized ensemble piece.
m/menace_ii_society," As uncomfortable as it is to have your nose shoved in this nightmare, it's unforgettable in its violent lyricism and the bloody power of its message."
m/menashe," Weinstein's charming Menashe immerses us in an authentic environment of ultra-Orthodox Judaism and makes it relatable by weaving a sweet story familiar in its general contours, of a single father struggling to hold onto the son he loves."
m/mendy_a_question_of_faith," It's not just Ivan Sandomire's broken English that's richly detailed, but his really intense body language, which suggests a small creature trying to find its sea legs."
m/mental_2012," This is clearly an aesthetic that [Hogan] adores, but the unbridled joie de vivre he specialises in has also resulted in a deeply indulgent, wildly unwieldy film that ultimately feels as schizophrenic as several of his characters."
m/menu_degustacio," Even with such fine actors as Fionnula Flanagan and Stephen Rea in the ensemble, the Spanish-Irish co-production is a flavorless affair that has all the bite of a dining room-bound episode of ""The Love Boat."""
m/mephisto_waltz, Alan Alda tinkles the devil's ivories in this super 70s Satan suspenser.
m/mercedes_sosa_the_voice_of_latin_america," A genuinely heartfelt, adequately informative introduction to the life and music of Mercedes Sosa."
m/mercenaries," All the fire power but with no substantial plot, this film will leave you feeling highly unsatisfied."
m/merchant_of_venice," A well made, beautifully acted film that remains gripping throughout its lengthy running time."
m/merchants_of_doubt," Illustrates how deniers have manipulated the scientific debate, and why the climate change scientists have succumbed to them."
m/merci_docteur_rey," It comes off as forced wackiness of the worst kind, at once cloddish and faux-sophisticated."
m/mercury_13," A portrait of the ""astronettes"" who, like the human computers of ""Hidden Figures"" ae forgotten women of the early days of the space program."
m/mercury_rising, The movie's premise is so ridiculous that some audiences might mistake it for a comedy.
m/mercy-2009," Don't let Mercy's title fool you, as there's no clemency here, from clich or pretentiousness."
m/mermaids," It's awash in mediocrity, waterlogged with innocuousness and redeemed only occasionally by sweet-faced Ryder."
m/merry_christmas_mr_lawrence, The context and frequent incontinence of the execution bring the film uncomfortably close to the pseudophilosophical bondage fantasies of Yukio Mishima.
m/merry_gentleman, Seems coolly unconcerned with showing us anything of its central relationship apart from a few awkward exchanges and uninterested in developing one of these characters beyond a near-silent abstraction.
m/meru_2015, Meru is an engaging and cumulatively exhilarating debut from wife-and-husband team Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin.
m/meskada," The script needs a map -- or a world atlas, for that matter -- because it has no clue where it's going or how to get there."
m/mesrine_public_enemy_1," [It has] assured direction by Richet, who handles the abundance of material well."
m/message_from_the_king," While its story moves forward in a way that makes sense, Du Welz's pacing is too slow and too choppy for the movie to build up much momentum."
m/messenger_the_story_of_joan_of_arc," The lack of a plausible leading lady is enough to sink what is otherwise an eye-catching, although heavily '90s-style, telling of one of history's most frequently filmed stories."
m/metallica_some_kind_of_monster," Because of its unexpected level of intimacy, it will likely hold the interest of even those with no interest in heavy metal bands."
m/metallica_through_the_never, I actually forgot I was watching a movie at some points and wanted to applaud in between songs.
m/method_to_the_madness_of_jerry_lewis," The weakness of this documentary is that it doesn't give us Mr. Lewis, warts and all."
m/metropolitan, One of the few films that successfully makes the East Coast upper class sympathetic. Stillman is current cinema's one true wit.
m/mexican," Too fractured and structurally slipshod to amount to much, and so ephemeral that it passes out of the consciousness almost as soon as it unspools."
m/mfa," Goes off the rails after an excellent first half hour, but Eastwood's performance is quite good, and the movie has its moments."
m/mfkz," The visual style and narrative are imaginative, and there's enough social commentary to give this silly caper some weight."
m/mi_5_2015," There is a lot of scope in rebranding the MI5 on film, away from the traditionalist tropes of 007, and vie for a more naturalistic take - but sadly Spooks: The Greater Good fails to deliver"
m/mia_and_the_white_lion, This film tells a marvelous story and has the clear intention to humanize our attitudes towards lions and wildlife. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/mia_et_le_migou," Mia and the Migoo boasts a handsome, folkloric look that is often undermined by a ham-handed script."
m/mia_madre," A lyrically textured group portrait of family loss and creatively confounded existential confusion. But emotionally insular political alienation upstaging pressing plot points tossed by the wayside, of an Italian working class in socio-economic crisis."
m/miami_blues," They're looking for the right tone in Miami Blues, and they don't find it very often, but when they do, you can see what they were looking for."
m/miami_connection, Clearly the greatest film ever made -- at least on whatever planet it came from.
m/miami_rhapsody," We already have a Woody Allen, but thanks anyway for applying."
m/miami_vice," Miami Vice delivers the thrills, atmosphere and romance it promises, but it doesn't resonate like major Mann."
m/michael-jordan-to-the-max," It's brilliance is to put you in the moment, some of the greatest moments in modern sports history."
m/michael_2011, The film was so expertly constructed that I found myself drawn into it and fascinated by what I saw.
m/michael_boltons_big_sexy_valentines_day_special," Michael Bolton's Big, Sexy Valentine's Day Special is proof positive that this kind of tongue-in-cheek homage is sometimes worth it. Today's titans of pop culture do well by the inspirations of their youth."
m/michael_che_matters, Even when some material isn't as strong-his biblical jokes run too long without being particularly original-Che can work a crowd.
m/michael_clayton," [A] lack of fireworks makes Michael Clayton refreshing in a sense, eschewing traditional white hats and black hats for more realistic shades of gray."
m/michael_collins," Collins, who died at 31, was arguably the key figure in the struggles that led to the separation of Ireland and Britain. He was also, on the basis of this film, a man able to use violence without becoming intoxicated by it."
m/michael_jackson_this_is_it," If you had time traveled in from, say, 2008, you could watch the entire movie and not know that Michael Jackson is now dead. That's how restrained this astonishingly entertaining concert film is."
m/mickey_blue_eyes, Barely distinguishable from other recent mob flicks like Analyze This.
m/mickeys-christmas-carol, Maybe it's the source material; it's hard as the dickens to beat Dickens.
m/mickeys_once_upon_a_christmas, Three average Christmas stories highlight positive messages.
m/micmacs," Filled with Jeunet's zany humour, fans will be impressed, although beginners should start with Amélie."
m/microcosmos, Astonishingly up-close and personal look at an infinitesimal world as alien as anything captured by the Mars rovers a world of strange fascination and unexpected beauty.
m/mid90s," The first feature from writer-director Jonah Hill shows some of the best qualities of veteran actors who step behind the camera, with nuanced performances so real the characters practically fall off the screen."
m/mid_august_lunch, A thoroughly delightful Italian film about a nurturing man who finds his caregiving responsibilities greatly expanded during a summer holiday.
m/middle_men," Sex, Lies And MasterCard. An irreverent, strictly behind the scenes tabloid peep show about those thankfully unsung guys who perpetrated the online porn revolution, without ever taking their clothes off."
m/middle_of_nowhere," Somber and moody, with assured direction by Ava DuVernay overseeing an exceedingly at-ease cast, the mood poem that is Middle of Nowhere is one of the best little films of the year..."
m/middle_school_the_worst_years_of_my_life, Bright direction and an exceptionally engaging cast of kids make this film a genuine family treat.
m/midgets-vs-mascots," Some films are good, some are bad. Some are like watching the end of civilisation in slow motion."
m/midnight-son," Driven by star-in-the-making lead Zak Kilberg...Midnight Son is a sad, scary, superb piece of low-budget filmmaking."
m/midnight_cowboy," Midnight Cowboy (1969) is an ultra-realistic film (shot on location) with sordid, downbeat and serious content. It portrays the unlikely companionship"
m/midnight_express," One of the most terrifying ""prison flicks"" you'll ever see."
m/midnight_family," Portraits of institutional dysfunction don't come much more urgent, and quietly bleak, than this..."
m/midnight_in_paris," Midnight It Paris is an amusing and elegantly constructed love letter to Paris, rich on romance, humour and culture and driven by a nicely pitched performance by Owen Wilson as a would-be writer in-love with the city and its cultural past."
m/midnight_in_the_garden_of_good_and_evil," The film's effect is that of a fictional travelogue that offers amusement, but lacks substance."
m/midnight_return_the_story_of_billy_hayes_and_turkey," Both a behind-the-scenes account of the original production and a feature-length mea culpa for a work that ""misrepresented an entire country and group of people,"" to quote one Turkish expert interviewed early on."
m/midnight_run," Brest propels the drama forward with planes, trains and automobiles (helicopters, too), but also makes time for De Niro, Grodin, and an excellent supporting cast, to make the frenetic ride well worth the trip."
m/midnight_special_2015," Sadly, the Spielbergian magic that Nichols so desperately wants to recreate is almost entirely absent from the end product and without it, there's something disappointingly lifeless instead."
m/midnight_sun_2018," A preposterous film so insufferably adorable and frightfully melodramatic that viewers will find themselves confused as to which reflex to stifle: The urge to howl, or the one to hurl."
m/midnighters," The intersection between crime thriller and horror is an interesting place to be, even if it doesn't fully pay off in Midnighters."
m/midnights_children, Rather more virtuosity behind the camera was required to induce the desired hypnotic effect. Deepa Mehta just isn't up to it.
m/midsommar," Midsommar is a shocking piece of filmmaking-unnervingly competent even when the film yaws into silliness, even when it risks tedium."
m/midsummer_nights_sex_comedy," Not among Woody's most memorable, but it's still pleasant enough to warrant a visit."
m/mifune_the_last_samurai," In many ways, Toshir Mifune the man remains just as mysterious after watching the film as he was before."
m/mifunes_last_song, A wry comic tale that's more sophisticated than most slick studio productions.
m/mighty, The film is barely watchable when [Gillian Anderson is] on screen.
m/mighty_ducks, The script by Steven Brill is pure formula and totally predictable. He takes absolutely no chances.
m/mighty_fine," Its most distinctive aspect, unfortunately, is the hilarious sight of MacDowell struggling to speak German-accented English."
m/mighty_heart," As Mariane, wife of slain jounralist Daniel Pearl, Angelina Jolie renders admirably understated performance, but Winterbottom's political drama is too safe and middlebrow, unable to decide what it is about and whose side of the story it is telling."
m/mighty_oak," It's a warm and welcoming film, a scrappy, scruffy underdog of a movie that, despite a few issues, will likely leave you with a smile on your face and a song in your heart."
m/mighty_quinn," The Mighty Quinn is a spy thriller, a buddy movie, a musical, a comedy and a picture that is wise about human nature. And yet with all of those qualities, it never seems to strain."
m/mighty_wind, The groups' idiotic smiles alone are almost worth the price of admission.
m/mike_and_dave_need_wedding_dates, Zac Efron and Aubrey Plaza lead a game cast in a gently nutty comedy that has a bit of cleverness to go with the raunch.
m/mike_birbiglia_my_girlfriends_boyfriend," My Girlfriend's Boyfriend has a through-line story of how the comedian and his wife eventually decided to get married despite not believing in marriage, and it is such a worked-through, complete piece that is both moving and incredibly funny."
m/mike_birbiglia_thank_god_for_jokes," No one is better at constructing hilarious, personal, soul-searching monologues of insecurity and Catholic guilt than Mike Birbiglia."
m/mikey_and_nicky," the film has matured very nicely, even though its protagonists never will"
m/milagro_beanfield_war, This is probably Redford's most complex and cleverly structured directorial effort.
m/milarepa," Myths are more popular in the movies than ever, but unlike the Christian extravaganza of The Chronicles of Narnia, Milarepa: Magician, Murderer, Saint won't be showing up on your kid's Netflix list."
m/mildred_pierce," One of the finest noir soap operas ever, with the queen of pathos shouldering the storm alone; her efforts snagged the golden statuette as 1945's Best Actress."
m/mile_22," The moral of Mile 22 is that modern warfare is a messy, indistinct, and depressing game. So, too, is an action movie such as this one."
m/miles_ahead_2016, [VIDEO] Don Cheadle's independently produced labor of love is an exquisitely polished love letter to the iconic genius who revolutionized music five times over during the 20th century.
m/miles_davis_birth_of_the_cool, Birth of the Cool is most riveting when documenting the boundary pushing sounds that Davis created
m/military_intelligence_and_you," To quote the film, 'There's no real victory in winning a battle we didn't have to fight.' Fair enough, but what about making a movie that didn't need to be made?"
m/military_wives," While Military Wives' plot sings to a very familiar tune, the film is still a crowd-pleaser."
m/milk, The first great film to look at civil rights from the perspective of the gay movement.
m/milk_of_sorrow," The message is unclear, unless it's to think twice before ordering chips in Lima."
m/millennium_actress_2001," ""Millennium Actress"" is about unrequited love, devotion, perseverance and hope told in a startlingly simple manner yet with epic proportions."
m/millers_crossing," The story, which is extremely labyrinthine and complex, is nevertheless one that is endlessly fascinating."
m/million_dollar_arm," Though ""Million Dollar Arm"" has an undeniable sweetness, there's a persistent phoniness to the script that leaves its twists and turns feeling manufactured rather than earned."
m/million_dollar_baby, Credible as both a boxing tale and a story about an unusual symbiosis.
m/million_dollar_hotel," Vacuous, tedious, pretentious and featuring some uniformly atrocious acting."
m/millions, Boyle's energetic pace and typically creative visuals suit the film's fanciful brushes with magic realism.
m/milton_glaser_to_inform_and_delight, What elevates the film to something more than a talking-heads documentary is the rapport established between Mr. Glaser and Ms. Keys on a project they both saw as a visual and verbal love letter to New York City.
m/miltons_secret," An oppressively earnest family flick that teaches a lesson about living in the moment, change and growth."
m/milyang-secret-sunshine, The film is brave and unsparing (as is Jeon's performance) and asks some challenging and disquieting questions...
m/mimic_sentinel," A tolerable and entertaining sequel to an abysmal franchise that rips from ""Sisters,"" shamelessly..."
m/mimzy, A pleasantly dorky adaptation of Lewis Padgett's 1943 sci-fi story directed by New Line honcho Bob Shaye.
m/mind-game, One of the essential animated features in the last 15 years.
m/mindhunters," An excellent addition to the genre... genuinely original, surprising and wholly exciting..the twists are never-ending"
m/mindscape_2013," [...] When it isn't head-smackingly obvious, is clumsily rushed and incoherent."
m/mine," A captivating, deeply moving, illuminating and well-balanced documentary for everyone, pet owner or not."
m/mine_2017, You'll end up wanting the mine to explode once for all. [Full review in Spanish]
m/mine_9," Mensore does his due diligence in showing us the claustrophobic, perilous conditions of the mine, even before disaster strikes..."
m/mine_vaganti, With a fluid and comedic style comes a film that understands its place in Italian society and doesn't expect any less than complete competency from its audience.
m/minions," The best voice work, though, was by co-director Pierre Coffin, who breathes life into Kevin, Stuart, Bob and a whole bunch of other Minions."
m/minority_report," Should knock the socks off anyone who enjoyed Spielberg's ""A.I."""
m/-_man," Coming at a time when people seem to be looking outwards for causes of violence, this movie challenges us to instead reflect inwards."
m/-cule_valley_of_the_lost_ants," A dialogue-free bug saga carried along by brilliant sound effects, an epic score and delightful animation in the service of an incredibly basic yet endlessly inventive story."
m/miracle," Miracle's most concrete achievement is in showing how, step by demanding step, Brooks was able to transform 20 young men used to playing as stellar individuals -- the American way -- into an unintimidate-able, egoless team, i.e., the Soviet way."
m/miracle_at_st_anna, Lee screws up his best ideas by trying to blow us away.
m/miracle_mile, A low-key and unsettling look at one possible armageddon.
m/miracle_of_morgans_creek," Sturges lets it all hang out, never passes over a joke and somehow manages to sustain the pace and quality."
m/miracle_on_34th_street, What makes Miracle a genuine miracle of holiday filmmaking is the pitch-perfect balance of social cynicism and human generosity.
m/miracle_on_34th_street_1994," Pays tribute to Santa Claus, a figure who stands for the grace, mystery and wonder available during the Christmas season."
m/miracles_from_heaven, In the end the film comes up with an almost humanist definition of miracles and their cause.
m/mirage_2019," Maybe the duration is excessive (just over two hours), but that the viewer will remain entertained. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/mirai, The film balances spiralling flights of fancy with glinting observations on parenting and family dynamics.
m/miral," I kept wondering how this pie-eyed tract, which spends two hours proclaiming the obvious about peace, entente and togetherness, could be made any more windily trite. I couldn't think of anything."
m/mirror_crackd," The big-name cast is a great, nostalgic throwback to the 1950s, when its players' names -- Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, Tony Curtis -- graced giant theater marquees."
m/mirror_has_two_faces," I didn't wanna like it. But by movie's end, I didn't hate it. Points for that."
m/mirror_mirror_2012," While Mr. Singh knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play, which effectively means that he's a better window dresser than a movie director."
m/mirrormask," If The Wizard of Oz were reborn in the 21st century, it might look a lot like MirrorMask."
m/mischief-night," Despite its shortcomings the film whips along at such a mischievous pace, you are carried away on its wave of enthusiasm."
m/misconduct," Except for Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Pacino, going through their familiar paces, incompetent is the word."
m/misery, Bates deserves her Oscar as the psychopath fan; a deft blending of comedy and horror.
m/misery_loves_comedy," Whatever it might take to get these admittedly very funny people to truly bare their souls, Pollak doesn't appear to have found it."
m/misfits," The Misfits (1961) is a poignant drama about the death of the old West, from director John Huston and screenwriter Arthur Miller (who was briefly married to star Marilyn Monroe from 1956-1960, wrote the film for her, and experienced a disintegrating..."
m/misfortunates," A word of advice: Do not invite the Strobbe family over for Christmas dinner, as they're likely to leave the house strewn with beer bottles and broken furniture."
m/misfortune," ""Misfortune"" is what it is, a small-budget neo-noir so generic that one half-expects to see a bar code rather than closing credits at the end."
m/mishima_a_life_in_four_chapters, Offers a mesmerizing profile of the famous Japanese writer whose life was filled with drama.
m/miss_americana, Wilson wields Swift's own words to tell a story that hints at the artist's shortcomings without ever feeling like it's being outwardly critical.
m/miss_arizona_2019," ""Miss Arizona"" alternates, not altogether gracefully, from heavy, tear-jerking moments to slapstick comedy, sometimes within the same sequence."
m/miss_bala_2011," An always violent, often surreal ride through the thickets of widespread corruption, with the audience sometimes left as confused and disoriented as the poor girl."
m/miss_bala_2019," Female-driven crime action has violence, swearing, drugs."
m/miss_congeniality, Bullock proves adept at tackling a more physical brand of comedy than she has attempted in the past.
m/miss_congeniality_2," Bullock struts her stuff well, but this comedy lacks freshness and sags in all the wrong places."
m/miss_fisher_and_the_crypt_of_tears," Sure, it's cheesy and the punny repartees are on the nose, but that's part of the enjoyment."
m/miss_julie_2014," Liv Ullmann's worshipful but static adaptation of the classic Strindberg play fails to work as a film, despite impressive perfs."
m/miss_juneteenth, Miss Juneteenth is a beautiful story of family as well as an inspiring one of hope. You'll love it for its authenticity and also in Channing Godfrey Peoples' ability to tell a story and create captivating and compelling characters.
m/miss_meadows," It takes a committed performance to make a character like Miss Meadows fly, and Katie Holmes goes all in."
m/miss_minoes," ""Miss Minoes"" is a film I suspect would be adored by young girls who love cats. I am not that young woman."
m/miss_peregrines_home_for_peculiar_children," Goldman's frequently amusing script is the secret ingredient that makes Miss Peregrine such an appropriate fit for Burton's peculiar sensibility, allowing the director to revisit and expand motifs and themes from his earlier work."
m/miss_pettigrew_lives_for_a_day," Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is a trifle of a movie confection, sweet and gummy as a jelly bean -- and 10 minutes later, just as forgettable."
m/miss_potter, A straight-laced fairy tale-style biopic appropriate to the audience for which its message of inspiration is finely attuned.
m/miss_sloane," If this were a TV pilot, we could at least sit back and wait for the character's vulnerabilities and backstories to emerge, but in the screenplay by first-timer Jonathan Perera, we get all the quirks and none of the depth."
m/miss_stevens," Hart imbues the film with both a natural visual harmony, as well as the simplicity of a lasting message: There are no easy answers when dealing with the complexities of other human beings."
m/miss_virginia," What makes Miss Virginia so heart-warming isn't the inevitable triumph we know is coming, but in watching how the people of the community come together as one."
m/miss_you_already," Fans of Hardwicke's groundbreaking Thirteen will be disappointed by this cheesy, pandering weepie about two lifelong friends living in England."
m/missing_link_2019," Missing Link is a charming adventure featuring Laika's most ambitious animation to date. It's their most accessible and conventional film yet, while still being leagues ahead of every other animation studio in the business."
m/mission_impossible," It's the worst kind of convoluted thriller -- it can never unravel satisfactorily because there's nothing simple at its center, just more confusion."
m/mission_impossible_2, A vaguely absurd epidemiological thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs.
m/mission_impossible_3," Exciting, kinetic and intelligent, J.J. Abrams theatrical debut is as good as anything he's produced on television. And that's saying something for the man who brought us Alias and Lost."
m/mission_impossible_fallout," McQuarrie makes sure to dazzle us, cloaking the expected in the unexpected, thus birthing a welcomed evolution."
m/mission_impossible_ghost_protocol," Fueled by Tom Cruise's propulsive, sometimes literally death-defying performance, this fourth installment is arguably the strongest of the series."
m/mission_impossible_rogue_nation," While the Mission: Impossible series may no longer feel fresh, it also shows no signs of self-destructing anytime soon."
m/mission_of_honor_2019," It's an old-fashioned boy's own tale, with the accent on boys - an attempt to widen the focus to the women working behind the scenes backfires slightly...Still, the story of the Polish pilots deserves to be told."
m/mission_to_mars, A film about space exploration that really knocks your eyes out.
m/missionary_2014," the divisions in America's culture wars take on dramatic form before our eyes, and two very different models emerge of the American family and its future: one a deluded dream, the other a compromised reality."
m/mississippi_burning," ""Mississippi Burning"" feels like a movie made from the inside out, a movie that knows the ways and people of its small Southern city so intimately that, having seen it, I know the place I'd go for a cup of coffee and the place I'd steer clear from."
m/mississippi_grind," ...it's perhaps a shame that ""Mississippi Grind"" is ultimately too underwhelming to stake with any confidence."
m/missouri_breaks, Brando admittedly improvised quite a bit in his over-the-top role.
m/mist, Darabont used the camera crew of the TV series The Shield. But what he really should have done is hire the show's cast.
m/mister_foe," Somehow the whole works surprisingly well, whether or not you end up thinking that it might have been still better left on the page."
m/mistress_1991," The movie has been described as a low-rent version of Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" but it would be more accurate to say it's about low-rent players."
m/mixed_nuts," A typical sight gag is people rollerbladding down the street carrying a Christmas tree between them. An irritated boyfriend then runs into them and knocks the tree over. Boy, that one sure put me in stitches."
m/mo_better_blues," Mo' Better Blues is not a great film, but it's an interesting one, which is almost as rare."
m/mo_money," Damon Wayans wrote Mo' Money as a star vehicle for himself and is credited as an executive producer. So, so it's safe to say he deserves the blame."
m/moana_2016," Its cultural setting is fresh; its storytelling, less so. It navigates the reefs but it doesn't discover a whole new world."
m/mob_town_2019, So much can be said about Mob Town and none of it is good.
m/mobsters," A potboiler in the quick-and-dirty tradition of the B movies of the '30s, it may not win any Oscars or garner rave reviews, but it's consistently entertaining, nevertheless."
m/mod_squad, I couldn't count The Mod Squad's plot holes with a calculator.
m/modern_life, Visually evocative and deeply moving on the theme of the deterioration of an ancient way of rural life.
m/modern_life_is_rubbish_2018," Mavor and Whitehouse, both of whom appear poised to break out after a series of smaller roles in TV and indie features, demonstrate a believable chemistry, but more importantly perhaps, a convincing hostility after their breakup."
m/modern_romance," Brooks can be very funny, but sometimes his whining mutes the laughs."
m/modern_times, Chaplin's sentimental but keenly satirical swipe at the mechanization of everyday life is by consensus the last of the great silent features.
m/modigliani," Both Modi and Jeanne are genuinely tragic figures. But the movie so trivializes them as adolescents, lacking control of their own emotions, that their tragedy never takes hold."
m/moebius_2013," Kim treats his bloody and provocative taboo breaking with a much lighter touch this time around, and the result, while still deeply flawed, is mostly a sly dark comedy that doubles as a very impressive display of wordless storytelling."
m/mohawk_2018, Mourns a centuries-old genocide through the torment of three young protagonists.
m/mojados_through_the_night_2004," A gripping documentary, although we learn too little of the relationship between the filmmaker and his subjects."
m/mojave_2016," Posing as a bogus thriller without one line of believable dialogue or one single thrill, Mojave is 93 minutes of gibberish with guns and phony literary pretentiousness about two thugs in a duel of weapons and words that goes nowhere fast."
m/mojin_the_lost_legend," Come for the murky action, and stay for the shudder-inducing feeling of nostalgia for Mao's Cultural Revolution. It's a very odd movie, indeed."
m/molly, Shue comes perilously close to offensive caricature as the afflicted Molly.
m/molly_maguires, The superb and beautiful camerawork of veteran cinematographer James Wong Howe gives a softness to the story that it would otherwise lack.
m/mollys_game, A fascinating story fairly well told with a committed take by its lead.
m/mom_and_dad_2018," Tanscends mere bad-taste humor to become one of the great jet-black comedies about suburbia, destined for the same cult-classic status accorded ""The Stepford Wives,"" ""Parents"" and ""Heathers."""
m/mom_and_dad_save_the_world," Too many canine-faced munchkins and Lovitz-Garr shenanigans do not a comedy make, folks."
m/mom_and_me_2017," A 77-minute heartfelt confection that is both tailored specifically to each pair it represents and demonstrates the strains of universality, truly making Mom and Me hit home with audiences that have ever had any sort of maternal relationships."
m/moments_of_clarity," The plot is rather generic and familiar but there are moments good humor and, yes, clarity."
m/momentum_2015," Momentum has plenty of visual flash, but the script is deeply dumb."
m/momentum_generation, Warm-hearted and thrilling in equal measure - Momentum Generation is an utterly compelling at a tight knit group of daredevils.
m/mommie_dearest, I can't imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie.
m/mommy_2015," Mommy is simply terrific, already one of the best films of the year. It's a film of rare poignancy and insight told with a delightfully nasal Québequois timbre."
m/mommy_dead_and_dearest," Digging beneath the headlines of the high-profile matricide, which turned out to involve one of the most horrific examples of Munchausen syndrome by proxy ever documented, Carr's film poses as many provocative questions as it answers."
m/moms_night_out, A timely testament to motherhood that just might make the perfect Mother's Day gift.
m/mon_oncle," A hard-edged satire that is both funny and beautiful, entertaining and thought-provoking."
m/mona_lisa," Skillfully combines comedy and thriller, romance and sleaze."
m/mona_lisa_smile," Merits A's for casting, writing, directing and fresh subject matter."
m/mondays_in_the_sun," A cannily observant but withholding film in which nothing happens, over and again."
m/mondo_cane," A quasi-documentary best remembered for the beautiful theme song ""More."""
m/money_buys_happiness," All in all, Money Buys Happiness shows that Lachow is a director worth keeping an eye on."
m/money_monster, [F]orget the 2008 financial crisis. The message of Money Monster would probably feel quaint at any point after the market crash of 1929.
m/money_pit, A movie that contains one funny scene and 91 minutes of running time to kill.
m/money_plane," Money Plane could have been a fun disaster of a film, but Copeland's obvious boredom sucks all the air out of the cockpit."
m/money_train," Snipes and Harrelson are still good together, but the screenplay stinks."
m/moneyball, Those who enter the cinema unstirred by either the sport or by the joys of stats are unlikely to come out converts.
m/mongol," While his film's historical accuracy might sometimes be questionable, Bodrov has created a spectacular film filled with all-natural beauty from the realistic locations, one that brings forth the man within the fabled barbarian"
m/monika-1953," Bergman would be no more adept a pornographer than he would be at filming hip-hop, but his camera did stare at the human surface with an intentness unmatched since von Sternberg rhapsodized over Marlene Dietrich."
m/monk_with_a_camera, Buried beneath the admiring encomia and ritual spectacle that clog the pores of this maddeningly tactful film is a tantalizing glimpse into the personal and institutional mechanics of Tibetan Buddhism.
m/monkey_shines_an_experiment_in_fear," As a pint-sized flipside to King Kong, Ella has her place among movie monsters"
m/monkey_trouble," A quirky, bright, PG-rated adventure that's as entertaining as Free Willy. Better, maybe, since monkeys are a lot more charismatic than whales. This is a splendid family film."
m/monkeybone, A Beetlejuice clone with more grotesquerie but far less mirth ... so strenuous you can almost see the sweat roll off the screen.
m/monogamy," Framed as a relationship-on-the-skids drama, Monogamy is instead a shallow and unconvincing look at male psychosexual pathology."
m/monsieur_lazhar_2011, Algerian Fellag plays the title role with an obvious love for young minds finding their place in the world.
m/monsieur_verdoux, Probably Chaplin's best talkie -- a masterpiece of black comedy.
m/monsoon_wedding," Mira Nair's distinctive, wholly engaging approach is somewhere between Dogme-style immediacy and Bollywood-calibre excess."
m/monster," As Aileen Wuornos, the notorious Florida murderer, Charlize Theron pulls off the year's most astounding screen makeover."
m/monster_camp_the_story_of_nero_seattle," Wonderfully wacky! ... Never poking fun at the people, the movie, nevertheless, is hilarious."
m/monster_family," A technically clean animation film, full of high plasticity, colour and detail in each of the scenarios presented. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/monster_house," This Roald Dahl-esque tale and cornball fantasy never quite jell into a satisfying movie experience. The move feels frustratingly disjointed like that lumbering, disintegrating house storming down the street."
m/monster_hunt, Tone and plot are all over the place and none of the characters -- monster or otherwise -- have enough depth to make you care about them.
m/monster_in_law, The movie might have been better served had it simply tossed out the Lopez character and given us more of Fonda.
m/monster_party_2018," Gleefully gory and darkly funny, Monster Party is the sort of extreme genre exercise that separates real fans from mere dilettantes."
m/monster_road, A documentary that doesn't always seem to be sure what it's documenting.
m/monster_squad, ...hasn't aged all that well in the years since its 1987 release...
m/monster_that_challenged_the_world," Giant mollusks as monsters? It sounds like perfect MST3K fodder, but the truth is that The Monster That Challenged the World is a fairly nifty '50s treat, with an intelligent script and decent effects (more so given its low budget)."
m/monster_trucks_2017," ""Monster Trucks"" feels like a throwback to the era of ""a boy and his (magical) dog"" movies - though these stories have significantly lost their charm since the industry switched from practical to digital effects."
m/monsters-2010," Gareth Edwards' independently made road/horror/politico/sci-fi film, gets all the points in the world for trying, but it ultimately comes up way short"
m/monsters_and_men," Superbly acted and impactful, Monsters and Men is a film about having the difficult conversations even when the answers to our questions might not be readily available."
m/monsters_ball, A shattering motion picture that packs a wallop...with two of the year's best performances.
m/monsters_dark_continent, Not so much a sequel as another stultifying character drama set in a world overrun by aliens ...
m/monsters_inc," While Shrek had an adult sensibility, Monsters, Inc. has a more childlike quality."
m/monsters_university," Pixar's emphasis on character and story made (and could make again) worlds that we fell in love with. Monsters University - a fun, disposable watch - has taken one of these worlds and repeated it to formula."
m/monsters_vs_aliens, It's not great -- but it's not bad -- and it's the first DreamWorks animated flick that won't feel dated by the time it hits home video.
m/monstrous, A refreshing new take on the Bigfoot sub-genre with something more on its mind than mere monster movie mayhem.
m/monte_carlo_2011," Monte Carlo is all about dj vu, cobbling together elements from so many other sources it feels like movie stew."
m/montenegro," If it begins deceptively, as though setting out to be your typically angst-ridden Swedish art movie, by the time it's reached its set of climaxes,Makavejev's film could not have strayed further from the beaten track."
m/monterey_pop," Next to Woodstock, this is an excellent glimpse into the sixties and the musical experience, with great performances from rock legends."
m/month_by_the_lake, Vanessa Redgrave has never been more likable on screen than in her buoyantly athletic turn here.
m/monty_python_and_the_holy_grail, one of the select cinematic experiences that actually gets better and better with subsequent viewings
m/monty_pythons_life_of_brian," A beautiful film, a perfect comedy, and a gentle triumph of silliness over pomposity, self-importance, and intolerance."
m/monty_pythons_the_meaning_of_life," Most every scene in the film employs humor as its function, yet retains the offshoot depth associated with its philosophic ambition."
m/mood_indigo," The nonsensical and surreal journey you are taken on will have you questioning what you just saw, yet at the heart of the film is a story of love and despair that translates across all languages."
m/moon," The amazing visuals and sound design (make) the movie so riveting, but its ability to let Rockwell shine with such a brilliant and rounded performance will probably be appreciated more."
m/moonlight_2016," An indelible portrait of an imperilled life, ""Moonlight"" is a devastating depiction of masculinity, race and identity. Ambitious in scope but precise in its execution, this deceptively small-scale character piece reverberates with compassion and insight."
m/moonlight_mile," 'Moonlight Mile' is a film of considerable substance. Sarandon, Hoffman, and Gyllenhaal give brilliant performances as people grieving over the loss of a loved one."
m/moonrise, The film's beauty lies in Borzage's overpowering visual mise-en-scene.
m/moonrise_kingdom," The biggest coup here is that Anderson has finally managed to anchor his trademark whimsy with a sincere and heady romanticism, and by the end, you may even be reaching for your immaculately embroidered handkerchief (or neck scarf) to wipe away the tears."
m/moonstruck, The Haley's Comet of Romantic Comedies - sparkling gems like this don't come along very often. One large supreme with extra spice.
m/moonwalkers_2016," Post-traumatic stress disorder isn't a common subject for laughs these days, but then ""Moonwalkers"" is not much of a comedy. It is common, though, with a lot of gross-out jokes about bodily functions, fat naked people or both."
m/mooz_lum_2010," Sensitive performances smooth out the dramatic rough spots of this well-intentioned, racially-charged drama."
m/mope," In the final twenty minutes, ""Mope"" - which is based on a true story? - goes off the rails and creates a memorable viewing experience, while teaching audiences something for their troubles. You learn something new everyday."
m/more_american_graffiti, Another sequel that never should have been committed to celluloid.
m/more_than_a_game," Belman doesn't look into the bigger problems of James' team jet-setting across the country during the school year, or the spectacle allowed to build up around him."
m/more_than_honey," What's really frightening about Honey isn't what a hive of angry bees might do to us, but what we've done to them."
m/more_than_the_rainbow_2012, The film's segments move seamlessly from one topic to the next with the unselfconscious ease of a good dinner party.
m/more_the_merrier," A gossamer-weight, charming film about how very awful it is to have the war fill every minute of your waking world - I don't know how that alchemy works, but it's sublime."
m/morgan_2016," Nobody seems to know quite how to navigate the assembled elements, casting off a disappointingly flat thriller ..."
m/morlang," Spins a tangled web of adultery, betrayal and professional and personal jealousy in the heady world of European high art."
m/morning-glory-2010," With an abundance of creative talent and laugh out loud moments ""Morning Glory"" is the perfect film for Fall."
m/morning_2013," Though mourning is a part of the human cycle, Morning is not an easy film to watch -- save for the great acting by the entire cast."
m/morning_light," For those of us attuned to the punched-up presentation of The Amazing Race and Survivor, built week by week to maximize human drama and suspense, Morning Light is just reality lite."
m/mortal_engines," The storytelling execution is just not totally there, a flat tire on the highway to being the next big thing."
m/mortal_kombat," It's silly, of course, but more importantly, it's a hell of a lot of fun, with plenty of above-average gags."
m/mortal_kombat_annihilation," Its dazzling special effects make its combatants flip and fly, spin and soar, all the while punching and kicking each other like jackhammers, only to leave viewers utterly unmoved."
m/mortal_kombat_legends_scorpions_revenge, Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge delivers all of the ultra-violent fights you'd expect but not much else.
m/mortdecai, It's undemanding stuff...but fans of Depp at his more energetic will see it as a collector's item.
m/moscow_belgium," Notice how deeply the director, Christophe van Rompaey, has drawn us into these lives, how much we finally care, and with what sympathy all the actors enter into the enterprise."
m/moscow_on_the_hudson, Essentially a vehicle for Williams to show off his manic shtick (and display the considerable acting skills that would later propel him into Oscar territory)...
m/moses_and_aaron, The film scrapes away the reverential patina surrounding religious subject matter to reveal contemporary urgency.
m/mosquita_y_mari_2012," Guerrero's quietly told and observant feature has ragtag realism on its sleeve, but unfortunately doesn't manage to assert itself as memorable."
m/mosquito_coast," The movie has been directed and acted so well, in fact, that almost all my questions have to do with the script: Why was the hero made so uncompromisingly hateful?"
m/moss_2018," Daniel Peddle's film emphasizes, for better and worse, the crushing monotony of living in insolated parts of the Deep South."
m/most_beautiful_island," The pivotal scenes may be fictionalised, but the prickling, precarious threat is clammily authentic and inspired by the experiences of the film's writer, director and star ..."
m/most_likely_to_die," A feather-light thriller that adds nothing new to the ""gather a group of friends and kill them off one by one"" genre. Though slickly produced and competently acted, the movie mostly just follows a formula."
m/most_likely_to_murder," Most Likely to Murder may not reinvent the wheel of holiday films, but its subversion of the genre, especially its willingness to fully indict and satirize its own protagonist, gives us ample reason to invest interest in the future of Gregor's filmography"
m/most_likely_to_succeed_2019," Whilst occasionally letting her film down with some editing choices that put the subjects in a box, Pamela Littky has made a really interesting film on the open-ended definition of success and the ever-shifting approach to pursue it."
m/most_wanted_2020," Does its... job with proficient integrity, but as much inventiveness as you'd guess from that all-purpose placeholder of a title."
m/mostly_martha," For the most part, the ingredients are there. But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck's film from coming together."
m/motel_hell," For an insanely silly drive-in horror-comedy with its tongue planted firmly in cheek, Motel Hell has it all."
m/mother-kusters-goes-to-heaven," For those who have not yet dribbled their toes in the cold waters of Fassbinder's psyche, Mother Kusters Goes to Heaven... is a worthy introduction."
m/mother_2017," Grappling with this climax -- steeped in gore, religious symbolism, hundreds of marauding strangers (including Kristen Wiig) and sheer chutzpah -- is the moviegoing gauntlet of the year."
m/mother_and_child," Not a single false note in this story of women's vulnerabilities, loneliness, seeking, disappointments, all brought about by the adoption conventions."
m/mother_india," Throughout Mother India, [Mehboob] presents the landscape, the crops, the herds of livestock practically as characters in themselves."
m/mother_may_i_sleep_with_danger_2016," The movie is much ado about nothing, feeling desperately thin and pointless. At first promising campy fun, it's soon simply mystifying, then misguided, gross and finally tiresome in its look-at-me-ness."
m/mother_night, Frankie Faison comes the closest to Vonnegut's spirit in his bold caricature of the Black Fuehrer of Harlem.
m/mother_of_george_2013," Simply relating the narrative of Andrew Dosunmu's seductive immigrant drama Mother of George would do little to convey the film's stark, poetic power, much less its extraordinary visual and sonic acumen."
m/mother_of_tears_the_third_mother, Both the body and the body politic are under attack in Mother of Tears.
m/motherhood," Dieckmann nails the look of a certain niche of urban neo-middle-class living, but the film's hyper-earnest tone and reliance on ""day-from-hell"" New York clichs overwhelm those details."
m/mothers_and_daughters_2016, The fractured nature of this multi-story ensemble means there is little chance of becoming completely engaged with any particular mother and daughter couple.
m/mothers_day," Blends unthinkably nasty horror elements with perverse comedy, intimate drama, and outrageously on-target satire without missing a beat."
m/mothers_day_2012," Mother's Day easily takes its place amongst the few successful remakes out there that manage to entertain while treating the audience with respect. Intense and at times shockingly violent, Mama's boys have once again made their mother very proud."
m/mothers_day_2016," There are a few moments of genuine emotion, mostly created by Robertson and Whitehall, but they are lone flowers in a desert of sitcom contrivance."
m/mothers_milk," The ever-chuntering narration, nicely read as it is by Tom Hollander, crushes everything in its path."
m/mothman_prophecies," The director, Mark Pellington, does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister, menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights, a rattling noise, and a bump on the head."
m/moulin_rouge_2001," I left Moulin Rouge feeling something, all right: I felt mauled."
m/mountain_men_2016," In Mountain Men, Labine and his cast achieve a hard-to-strike balance of comedy and heart-felt drama while maintaining a subtleness that respects your adult attention span."
m/mountain_patrol_2006," [It's] austere, unsentimental, morally complex, and grimly realistic..."
m/mountains_may_depart_2016, No director has done more to chronicle change in contemporary China and the instability it breeds in the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people. Yet there's a foreground/background problem that continues to plague his work ...
m/mouse_hunt, The climax is just what you'd expect...in a good way of course.
m/moustache," Too many narrative illogicalities make the 86 minutes seem long, despite two excellent performances and an intriguing premise."
m/mouth_to_mouth_2006, Worth seeing even if only for Ellen Page's stunning performance.
m/movie_43," Your laugh mileage may vary (God forbid), but we can all agree on one thing: this is the biggest waste of talent in cinema history."
m/moving_midway," In its 98 minutes, film critic Godfrey Cheshire's documentary Moving Midway records an amazing architectural feat, and that's the least of its virtues."
m/mowgli_legend_of_the_jungle," Serkis throws in too many new elements and, in the process, derails the plot's familiarity and some of its charms."
m/mozarts_sister," An intimate and subdued tale of suppressed talent and filial loyalty, the film builds an engaging fiction around some of the facts of Nannerl, the older sister of the famous Wolfgang Amedeus Mozart."
m/mr-lucky," Picture carries an authentic ring to operations of bigtime gamblers, and it faithfully follows the professional premise of 'never give the sucker a break, but never cheat a friend'."
m/mr-right," This interminable, Soho-based gay relationship drama is especially marred by the dire acting of Luke de Woolfson, who plays a bad actor."
m/mr_3000, Mac displays the same rough charm that we see on his TV show and in his supporting roles.
m/mr_and_mrs_smith, Kinsberg's highly tuned comedic dialogue pulls the film out of the fire by keeping the blistering husband and wife conflict chugging.
m/mr_arkadin," Endlessly inventive thriller, with spectacular visual style from Welles."
m/mr_beans_holiday, What could have been a series of big and bigger set pieces instead flows smoothly from each corny gag to the next goofy slapstick routine.
m/mr_brooks," The alter-ego gimmick works nicely thanks to terrific Costner-Hurt teamwork in this gripping, complex thriller."
m/mr_bug_goes_to_town, A bizarre mess that fails at every imaginable level.
m/mr_church," Get out your handkerchiefs, but don't expect to believe a minute of this vastly improbable tale."
m/mr_deeds," Overall, 'Deeds' proves that Sandler's comedy is showing it's age. While not as horrid as 'Little Nicky,' 'Deeds' remains outside of Sandler's circle of great comedies."
m/mr_deeds_goes_to_town, It's tough enough to film a credible morality play without being laughed out of town. It's altogether mind boggling to do so and provide a grade A romantic comedy to boot.
m/mr_destiny," A fun, sweet movie about learning to appreciate what you have when the grass isn't actually greener on the other side."
m/mr_dynamite_the_rise_of_james_brown, Mr. Dynamite is a strikingly varied and substantial portrait of an intensely complex artist.
m/mr_gaga_a_true_story_of_love_and_dance, Director Tomer Heymann captures both the intimate authority of Naharin at work and then the beautiful range of movement conveyed on stage by his dancers.
m/mr_hollands_opus, Extraordinary movie about how a job can be transformed into a soul-satisfying vocation.
m/mr_holmes," There's nothing about the film that Conan Doyle fans, McKellen fans, Linney fans, and anyone partial to a lilting Carter Burwell score won't relish."
m/mr_hulots_holiday," ...a cinematic gem, and one not to be missed...worth a hundred-fold the money you’d spend for any of today’s attempts at screen comedy."
m/mr_jealousy," Overlong, mediocre romantic comedy that barely even delivers on its premise."
m/mr_jones_2013," Early scenes prove an exception to most of this genre du jour's tired rules, which makes it especially disappointing when the third act does little more than reinforce them."
m/mr_magoo," By turns frenetic and flat-footed, Mr. Magoo is an uninspired live-action comedy."
m/mr_magoriums_wonder_emporium, Sprinkles in charming moments but ultimately doesn't evoke enough wonderment to overcome its tongue-twisting title and completely win over adults along with kids.
m/mr_majestyk," Majestyk is a multidimensional hero. He's socially conscious yet individualistic, half-smart and semi-tough, human enough to make mistakes and man enough to correct them."
m/mr_nanny, The cinematic equivalent of garden shears in the eyeballs.
m/mr_nice," At the centre Ifans delivers a magnetic, robust performance that's both funny and surprisingly introspective"
m/mr_nobody," This is thought provoking without pretentiousness, full of ideas and passion that deserves a wide audience...Giving oneself over to the film is a pleasure that's not soon to be repeated."
m/mr_north," It's as if the qualities that, at his best, made Huston great had been magically bequeathed to all his heirs."
m/mr_peabody_and_sherman," Witty, beautifully animated and surprisingly educational, DreamWorks' time-travelling adventure should impress kids and parents in equal measure."
m/mr_pip," Know what you're in for, because what you're in for is difficult."
m/mr_poppers_penguins_2010, Fervently panders to an under-10 audience with Carrey's main requirement only to mug in a variety of reaction shots to his beaked sidekicks' mischievous hijinks and to provide name-brand legitimacy to a dim and unfunny project.
m/mr_right_2016," ...the two central performances, charming as they sporadically are, veer more towards obnoxiously broad than comedically endearing."
m/mr_smith_goes_to_washington, Every citizen should be made to watch in exchange for the right to vote.
m/mr_turner," One of [Mike] Leigh's most rewarding works. He is now 71, but this film and his last one, Another Year, show that he's at the lofty peak of his powers."
m/mr_wonderful," Mr. Wonderful starts off with great promise, then gradually runs out of steam, wasting a very talented but woefully underused cast."
m/mr_woodcock, Does anyone need further proof that perhaps Billy Bob Thornton is a comedy wet blanket?
m/mr_wrong," As directed sloppily by Nick Castle, this comedy barely lets its main characters develop, even though either of them could be great fun."
m/mrs_brown, How the story resolves itself is a bit unusual and not near as tidily wrapped up as we have come to expect from our films. More like real life.
m/mrs_dalloway," Vividly conveys the message of Woolf's novel- despite social and psychological differences, we are all connected."
m/mrs_doubtfire, I laughed so hard several times that I had trouble stopping.
m/mrs_henderson_presents," Though more grounded than last year's Being Julia (also set in London, at the same time), this is still a slender tale elevated by some personal intrigues and fluffy tableaux."
m/mrs_hyde, Bozon...seems perversely committed to frustrating not just conventional audience expectations but also any hope whatsoever that one might have for narrative and/or thematic coherence.
m/mrs_lowry_and_son," As impressive as Spall and Redgrave are, however, both individually and when in the throes of a heated wrangle of power and emotion, it's not quite enough to carry a whole film."
m/mrs_miniver, Watch Garson's eyes slowly enlarge as the squeal of falling bombs gets louder and louder. She looks genuinely afraid for her life.
m/mrs_palfrey_at_the_claremont," Dame Joan Plowright has been cast here in the most dominant and demanding role that she has ever undertaken in a 54-year career on stage, screen and television."
m/mrs_parker_and_the_vicious_circle, A great ensemble helps to cut through a fairly stuffy narrative.
m/mrs_serial_killer," Mrs. Serial Killer could have been an amusingly tongue-in-cheek affair, but it doesn't seem to know where to find its tongue. Or its cheek, for that"
m/mrs_winterbourne," Lake, in the central role, seems distracted and only nominally interested in what's going on around her."
m/ms_45," Ms. 45 looks as cheap and sleazy as it needs to be, but this factor actually adds to the movie's vicious feel."
m/much_ado_about_nothing_2012," The film is nothing without the physicality of the performers, as Joss Whedon's script handles the transition of Shakespeare's language to modern day indifferently."
m/muck," One of the most obnoxious horror pictures in recent years, a low-rent cinematic charade that goes beyond spoofery and into a realm of distasteful, tacky, IQ-shrinking tedium."
m/mud_2012," An atmospheric thriller and coming-of-age tale set on a slow bend in the Mississippi river, Mud has the look and feel of an American indie classic."
m/mudbound," This densely textured, populous narrative ... is given novelistic room to breathe and a slow-burn intensity that builds to a shattering conclusion."
m/mugabe_and_the_white_african_2010," One family's catastrophe, filmed covertly to avoid a press ban, reflects a whole nation brought to its knees by a self-serving despot and his thuggish enforcers."
m/mughal_e_azam," An example of popular folk art at its most endearing, and while the film is filled with considerable grace, as a mass entertainment it has not an ounce of subtlety."
m/mulan, A charming little story that's also an empowering fable for all the girlies out there.
m/mulan_ii," It's no surprise that a script this addicted to fortune cookie utterances would fall short on presenting a sane, realistic version of China."
m/mulberry_street, ...starts out like the sort of indie art-house fare you'd expect an up-and-coming film student to make...but soon a mutant strain of bubonic plague spread by rats starts turning all the inhabitants of New York into rat-faced zombies.
m/mule_2014," There's something deliciously twisted about watching cops, crims, judges and lawyers all awaiting the outcome of a single, stubborn s***."
m/mulholland_dr, Few will be able to resist its heady sense of intrigue and two riveting lead performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring.
m/mulholland_falls," Connelly, Melanie Griffith and Bruce Dern all fare well in a predominantly misused cast, but the tone of this talkfest is dreary."
m/multiple_maniacs," Uneven, to put it mildly. But when it is funny, it is priceless."
m/multiple_sarcasms, This hoary midlife-crisis tale is watchable solely for its reliable cast.
m/multiplicity," If ever there was a movie that showed off an actor's versatility, this is it."
m/mum_and_dad," This lean, mean British horror is just gonzo enough to overcome the limits of the formula and keep us entertained"
m/mumford," It simply lacks the kind of audacity, confidence and substance that was the hallmark of Kasdan's best work in the '80s."
m/mumia_long_distance_revolutionary," More of a tribute than a hard-hitting piece of American filmmaking, which is too bad, because the subject - the imprisonment of ex-Black Panther figure Mumia Abu-Jamal - deserves a thorough, serious examination."
m/mummy_returns," Although the sequel retains its predecessor's breezy (verging on airheaded) retro spirit, The Mummy Returns is a mite darker and scarier and the effects a little spiffier."
m/mummy_tomb_of_the_dragon_emperor," The movie feels like the direct-to-dvd version of The Mummy, complete with cheesy, already-done CG effects, and best of all, not a single actual mummy in the entire movie."
m/mummys_ghost, Occasionally atmospheric series entry with unusual dowbeat tone.
m/mummys_hand," More campy than creepy, still an entertaining blend of action, adventure and comedy."
m/mummys_tomb," A B-programmer sequel and how come no one ever thinks to just outrun that slow-moving, one-armed stalker!"
m/munich," This is new territory for Spielberg, and he completes the journey with honor."
m/munyurangabo, Two friends in Rwanda dealing with the fallout from the genocide which lingers in their consciousness and souls.
m/muppet_christmas_carol," Another Muppet classic. The best ""Christmas Carol"" adaptation yet!"
m/muppet_movie," What in the world can you say about this? The purest, funniest and most endearing Muppet flick--it's simply the pinnacle of extant evidence we have to the genius of Henson and those he surrounded himself with. Highly recommended."
m/muppet_treasure_island," Disappointing Muppet movie. Too much Treasure Island, not enough Muppets."
m/muppets_from_space," Let me make things clear: I still like the Muppets, but an increase in quality is in serious need."
m/muppets_most_wanted, The creative spark and sense of purpose are gone in this hokey transcontinental caper.
m/muppets_take_manhattan, Doesn't have a ton of story but the music and characters are charming to make it a fun watch
m/murder_at_1600, The last third of the film is a ready-made action movie plug-in.
m/murder_at_the_vanities," The Earl Carroll show transplanted to the screen, with more beautiful girls than you can shake a stick at."
m/murder_by_death, ...pokes fun at every old fictional detective you can think of and every clich you've ever wanted to red pencil out of a script.
m/murder_by_decree, Murder by Decree is spiffy entertainment for lovers of good mystery stories.
m/murder_in_the_first," Attempts to masquerade as a historical drama, but twists the facts to have them fit the traditional Hollywood courtroom drama."
m/murder_my_sweet, Treats us to some savory snatches of dialogue in the best noir tradition.
m/murder_mystery," It would be uncomfortably cynical to assume that Sandler thinks these novocaine-like comedies are what common people want to watch, but the guy doesn't leave us much choice."
m/murder_of_a_cat," A forced, grating snore of a contrivance masquerading as a quirky comedy. One of the worst movies of 2014."
m/murder_on_the_orient_express, [A] terrifically entertaining super-valentine to a kind of whodunit that may well be one of the last fixed points in our inflationary universe.
m/murder_on_the_orient_express_2017," It hardly stirs the heart, at least not as much as you feel it should have done."
m/murder_party," Surprisingly well-acted, fast-paced, frequently amusing and packed with some really crazy kills near the end."
m/murder_set_pieces, A rather sickening marathon strung together by the flimsiest of subplots and populated exclusively by blood-soaked strippers.
m/murder_to_mercy_the_cyntoia_brown_story, Murder to Mercy: The Cyntoia Brown Story is what happens when a crime documentary loses sight of its focus.
m/muriel-1963," Alain Resnais deals with the impact of the war in Algeria on a French veteran. Although the surrealist touches seem dated, the issues of war and torture are not--especially in light of the current war in Iraq."
m/muriels_wedding," Muriel's Wedding isn't a perfect comedy, tragedy, or drama, but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look."
m/murph_the_protector_2013," ... a documentary with the limited but entirely honorable mission of commemorating the life and sacrifice of Navy Lt. Michael P. Murphy, a Navy SEAL who died in a firefight in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan in June 2005."
m/murphys_romance," Unfortunately, this sweet and homey picture which casts two very decent actors (Sally Field and James Garner) in two very decent roles, falls far short of compelling filmmaking."
m/muscle_shoals_2013," Overall, it's joyous, uplifting - and as funky as the music at its heart."
m/muse, One of the more obnoxious movies of the past 200 years.
m/museum_hours," It finds the time to look at looking, and to offer a slow revelation: to the lonely and the stranded, it is art that feels like home."
m/music_and_lyrics," Written using ""20 Master Plots (And How to Build Them)"" with an Adam Sandler declaration-of-love-in-a-stadium ending."
m/music_from_the_big_house," This is utterly sincere, and there is lasting value in getting violent men to turn their energies to peaceful expression: ""When you're singing, you're not angry,"" Chiarelli says."
m/music_from_the_inside_out_2005, It doesn't attempt to neatly summarize the musical experience. Anker gives the players free rein to express their wonderment.
m/music_of_the_heart, Music of the Heart is a first-class treatment of an extraordinary story.
m/music_within," Sheen, like the movie itself, is trying too hard to inspire when the story doesn't need the help."
m/must_love_dogs," If you love this movie, you're figuratively obeying the title's injunction."
m/mustang_2015," [Erguven] proves especially skilled with her cast of newcomers, whose powerful individualism as well as their vibrant bond together are perfect vessels for the script's message."
m/mutant_aliens," For the future, one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band, a professional screenwriter."
m/mutant_chronicles," oloklirotiki adynamia ton synteleston eite na kratisoyn to pantrema sto paradosiaka apodekto, eite na to perasoyn sto prohorimeno aisthitika, os stilistika proothimeno, geionontas se akribos sto kentro enos paradoksoy yparksiakoy uncanny valley"
m/mute, This derivative sci-fi thriller about a missing woman struggles to find its own voice and consistent character.
m/mutual_appreciation," If John Cassavetes had directed a script by Eric Rohmer, the result might have looked and sounded like Mutual Appreciation."
m/my-dog-tulip, Paul and Sandra Fierlinger illuminate the very core of J. R. Ackerley's novel about the love between a man and his dog.
m/my-girl-2, It's always that second dollop of syrup that turns your pancakes into an inedible mass.
m/my-perestroika," Director Robin Hessman, who spent the 1990s living and working in Russia, follows five Russian 30-somethings in her insightful, poignant verite portrayal of the effects of political, social and economic changes resulting from Perestroika."
m/my_all_american_2015," An uplifting testament to an old-fashioned, real-life hero that time forgot."
m/my_amityville_horror_2012," Provides only one small fragment of the Lutz story, and is only fascinating for a fraction of its running time."
m/my_beautiful_girl_mari, Lee Sung-gang's exquisite tale of childhood remembrance and imagination is... a patient fantasy painted in swaths of color...
m/my_beautiful_laundrette," This story of complicated human beings trying to get by in a morally confusing world made director Stephen Frears' name on the international stage, and it remains highly watchable today."
m/my_best_enemy_2013," Neither the plot of this farfetched caper nor Murenberger's approach to it, do any kind of justice to what is still, whether some people like it or not, one of the most terrible episodes in human history."
m/my_best_fiend," Mein Liebster Feind is a tentative exploration of the borders of friendship, madness, and genius."
m/my_best_friend_2007, My Best Friend proves that even the most artificial premise can yield a heartfelt result.
m/my_best_friends_wedding, Echoes of Roberts' personal life slop over into the plot with the alacrity of a foot fungus doing the two-step in the locker room of a high school gym.
m/my_big_fat_greek_wedding," Like Vardalos and Corbett, who play their roles with vibrant charm, the film, directed by Joel Zwick, is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake."
m/my_big_fat_greek_wedding_2," Is the ensemble responsible for this sit-com conspiring to suffocate us in the audience, just as they portray a suffocating Greek family?"
m/my_big_night_2016," Despite its frequent on-target satire, My Big Night's ropy plot feels like it was written on the back of a serviette one drunken evening."
m/my_blind_brother, Sophie Goodhart's My Blind Brother has clear eyes on full hearts.
m/my_bloody_valentine," Director George Mihalka gets effectively naturalistic performances out of his leads, as well as an intermittently eerie mood, but ultimately, it's a movie enjoyed more for what it could've been than what it actually is."
m/my_bloody_valentine_3_d," There's nothing sweeter that watching a film that knows exactly what it is. At no point does MBV:3D pretend to be anything but a mindless slasher film straight out of your DVD collection. [It's] is jammed with great kills, loads of gore & plenty of laughs"
m/my_blueberry_nights," ... while the actors' dialogue delivery is perfectly natural, the aphoristic philosophical nuggets Wong favors sound banal and clunky in this context, leaving the film thematically in the shallow end of the pool."
m/my_bodyguard," In his directorial debut, Tony Bill assembles a truly remarkable cast of youngsters with little or no previous acting experience."
m/my_bosss_daughter," A sloppy, shambling farce..but Kutcher's amiability, Stamp's skill and the sporadically inventive slapstick make it more tolerable than you might expect."
m/my_boyfriends_back," If My Boyfriend's Back is an irredeemably silly movie, it has an engaging lightness of tone and uniformly impeccable performances by a cast that maintains just the right attitude of deadpan parody."
m/my_brilliant_career," The action and sentiments are familiar to the point of cliche, and there isn't much life in Gillian Armstrong's academic direction."
m/my_brother_the_devil_2012, The radiance of My Brother The Devil should also work as an audition tape for Letitia Wright.
m/my_country_my_country, Courageous effort by Laurie Poitras to tell painful truths about Iraq under occupation
m/my_cousin_rachel_2017," Weisz nearly vibrates with tremulous emotion, and the British countryside - full of romping wolfhounds, droning vicars and ancient family retainers - feels like yet another old and welcome character in this old-fashioned yet modern Gothic."
m/my_cousin_vinny," It's the kind of movie home video was invented for: Not worth the trip to the theater, but slam it into the VCR and you get your rental's worth."
m/my_darling_clementine," The first couple of times we saw My Darling Clementine on the late show we watched the beginning, fell asleep in the middle, woke up at the end, and thought we had sat through one of the best films we had ever seen. Then we finally forced ourselves to sta"
m/my_date_with_drew," Not only is that message loud and clear but the movie is also funny, exciting and awkward as we literally go through every emotion with the extremely self-conscious Herzlinger."
m/my_days_of_mercy," The movie doesn't buckle under the weight of its ambitions, and in straining to find the light it ends up engaging and compelling - even if it is overly complex."
m/my_dead_boyfriend," ""My Dead Boyfriend"" desperately tries to look and sound like a quirky indie hit, but that's not an achievable goal when you have an unlikable lead character indifferently rendered by a name star."
m/my_dinner_with_andre, A couple of New York intellectuals get together for dinner and have a confessional chat about their life. Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory play themselves.
m/my_dinner_with_herve," Engaging, funny, insightful, and in possession of Dinklage's best work since The Station Agent, My Dinner With Hervé is a reservation one shouldn't pass up."
m/my_dog_skip, You'll be reaching for your hanky and wondering why movies can't always be this good.
m/my_entire_high_school_sinking_into_the_sea, Combining a disaster movie with a high school comedy while also animating it is a rather ambitious combination. What's even more incredible is just how well it all works.
m/my_father_and_the_man_in_black," It's fascinating to look at the life of Johnny Cash from a new angle, even if this documentary feels somewhat self-indulgent and a bit amateurish."
m/my_father_die," Brosnan's epic approach, melded with tiny details (like having Asher's inner monologue be his voice as a child, the last time he had one) gives it lush, poetic life. Then he lets the violence rip with two standout performances by British actors."
m/my_fathers_glory, My Father's Glory is the first in a series of two films that creep up on you with small moments of warmth and charm.
m/my_favorite_brunette," Bob Hope comedy of errors with the one-liners a bit on the thin side, but Lon Chaney Jr. adds a little nutty fun and Peter Lorre some sinister noir atmosphere."
m/my_favorite_martian," What we have here is a highly agreeable cast goofing around within the familiar parameters of the alien-lost-on-Earth story, to absolutely no purpose except killing time."
m/my_favorite_season," My Favorite Season-Deneuve's third film with director André Téchiné, and which he cowrote expressly for her-gives the actress one of the richest, most equitable relationships she's ever shared with a male co-lead."
m/my_favorite_wife," The direction of Garson Kanin is spotty, and there is evidence of faults in editing -- but who cares?"
m/my_favorite_year, An excellent vehicle for O'Toole to shine in a tour de force performance.
m/my_fellow_americans," These two wily souls ham it up beautifully in this otherwise routine comedy, and for them alone, this movie is one to be savoured."
m/my_first_mister," Not one second of it is believable, not one scene looks right, not one performance salvages the growing pile of snotty Kleenex it wishes you'd cry into."
m/my_first_wedding," My First Wedding has Rachael Leigh Cook's off-kilter rhythm going for it, and it needs it because everything else about the movie is way too on-kilter."
m/my_flesh_and_blood," There may have been 'no grand plan' to Susan Tom's life, as she says, but grand is a good word for what's happened."
m/my_friend_dahmer," What we're left with is a portrait of the eternal freak, resigned to damnation because he couldn't make friends or lovers out of the young geeks surrounding him, despite his best efforts."
m/my_friend_flicka, Shows its age while offering up a sort of illusory nostalgia born and bred almost entirely within the cinema experience.
m/my_giant, A by-the-numbers road comedy with predictable signposts and not enough giggle-provoking pitstops along the way.
m/my_golden_days," A Frencher-than-French tale of deeply-anchored yet partially thwarted romance, Arnaud Desplechin's My Golden Days is touching, involving and very well acted."
m/my_hindu_friend," ...surreal, reflective (though never sentimental) with Fellini-esque flights of frank sexuality, eroticism and existential whimsy..."
m/my_journey_through_french_cinema," A passionate, opinionated, drop-dead fascinating documentary essay about that country's film history put together by a clear-eyed enthusiast who was born to tell the tale."
m/my_joy, The unsettling mood -- many scenes have a documentary verisimilitude that heightens the threat of random violence -- keeps us off-balance but riveted.
m/my_kid_could_paint_that, A fascinating subject handled with intelligently provocative care.
m/my_last_five_girlfriends, Some very different cinematic methods and above-average acting and direction make this entourage of beautiful people a rom-com worth watching.
m/my_left_foot," Inspiration is inherent in Brown's story, but Sheridan, co-screenwriter Shane Connaughton, and Lewis refuse to sanctify him."
m/my_life," The sincere, often touching story tugs shamelessly at the heartstrings."
m/my_life_as_a_dog, My Life as a Dog is not just a fine portrait of childhood and how children react to life's problems; it is a comparison of philosophies of life.
m/my_life_as_a_zucchini, Barras has bravely tackled an almost taboo subject and made it palatable and manageable for children and adults alike.
m/my_life_directed_by_nicolas_winding_refn," Writer-director Liv Corfixen works harder to coddle Drive director Refn, her husband and subject, than she does to get inside his head."
m/my_life_in_ruins," The film has the feel of a vaudeville show, with a series of stock characters entering and exiting, hamming for the camera as they go."
m/my_life_so_far, An appealing view of life on a Scottish estate in 1927.
m/my_little_pony_the_movie_2017," The cinematic hug you seek is right here. Everypony, smile."
m/my_love_dont_cross_that_river," Its subjects are remarkably charming, their love a model of both tranquil compatibility and resilient playfulness."
m/my_mistress," While it's good that Lance eschews the conventional, the question becomes, what does he have in its place? I was left unsure of the answer."
m/my_name_is_joe," Loach's keen eye for unpolished reality and Mullan's passionate, well-modulated turn keep the film well worth watching."
m/my_name_is_khan," Without any gimmickry, Khan captures the nervous ticks and emotional barriers that an afflicted individual must battle against daily. It's a showy performance but in the right kind of way."
m/my_name_is_myeisha, Rachel Walker gives a tremendous performance... I was really blown away by this film.
m/my_neighbor_totoro, one of the most accomplished and important children's films ever made.
m/my_neighbors_the_yamadas," A deceptively slight film, imbuing into its simplistic animation style and sly humor an astounding level of philosophy"
m/my_old_lady, The dramatic heft may feel a little light to some viewers but it is still hugely engaging and perceptive about the way one person can have a very different identity and presence in the lives of everyone close to them.
m/my_own_private_idaho," The performances, especially by the two young stars, are as surprising as they are sure."
m/my_piece_of_the_pie, Paints an alluring picture of a pan-European cosmopolitan culture whose characters hopscotch from one country to another with hardly a second thought in a lighthearted floating party.
m/my_reincarnation_2011," An intriguing, Marjoe-esque adventure, highlighting how a corporate position at IBM might have belatedly led a reluctant, designated-demigod down a path of enlightenment lined by throngs of gullible devotees-in-waiting."
m/my_side_of_the_mountain, Good family viewing that will delight kids and interest grown-ups as well.
m/my_son_2019, It is always a pleasure to be reunited with Guillaume Canet. [Full review in Spanish]
m/my_son_my_son_what_have_ye_done, Herzog's second film of the year -- the supposed antidote to Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans -- is such a confused jumble of influences that it is completely ineffectual both as an experience and as an instrument of dialogue.
m/my_son_the_fanatic," Om Puri's performance is based on the substantial strength of his physical presence, and on his clear-sighted view of his world as an exile."
m/my_sucky_teen_romance," Gently sending up both the awkwardness of adolescent love pangs and the silliness of geek get-togethers, Hagins' film is short, but also very sweet, making up for its obvious budgetary shortcomings with energy, enthusiasm and inventiveness."
m/my_summer_of_love, A love fantasy with sparkling performances by newcomers Nathalie Press and Emily Blunt.
m/my_super_ex_girlfriend, Has occasional spurts of laughter but is otherwise benign and dopey.
m/my_uncle_rafael, A hokey story with a needless reality-show overlay.
m/my_way_2011, A fascinating historical footnote becomes an excuse to throw lots of money at the screen in Kang Je-kyu's My Way.
m/my_way_2012," Marshals an overbearing score, turbulent handheld camerawork, and a punishingly brief average shot duration toward the story of two archnemesis long-distance runners who form an unlikely alliance amid the welter of world war."
m/my_week_with_marilyn," My Week with Marilyn is little more than Styrofoam packaging for a Michelle Williams Oscar campaign, all shrink-wrapped and ready to go."
m/my_worst_nightmare, ...a terminally uneven piece of work that will leave most viewers flummoxed and frustrated.
m/mysteries_of_lisbon, Say what you will about 19th-century literature -- they had stories in those days (and stories within stories).
m/mysteries_of_pittsburgh, ... almost indistinguishable from any other portrait of the aimless American male who is jolted from passivity to action by a reckless pal.
m/mysteries_of_the_jesus_prayer," Though initially fascinating, this two-hour travelogue soon becomes repetitive as it forsakes stark desert isolation for icon-festooned churches and overcrowded ceremonies."
m/mysterious_skin, Dramatically shows how some victims of sexual abuse are affected.
m/mystery_alaska," If you drop the ""c"" in hockey you get a perfect description of Mystery, Alaska."
m/mystery_men, Mystery Men's greatest resource -- its terrific actors -- have goofy charm to spare and really know how to put the punch in punchlines.
m/mystery_road_2013," Sen... creates a Great Southern western, using the iconography of the oater to show the Australian landscape as something akin to the shifting boundaries (geographical, moral, racial) of America's wild, wild cowboy days"
m/mystery_science_theater_3000_the_movie, A flat-out hilarious celebration of B-moviemaking mastery.
m/mystic_pizza," The only novelty of this familiar small-town coming-of-age saga is that its women are Portugueste-American, but it's laced with humor and well-acted, and the gorgeous-looking Julia Roberts shows strong potential for becoming a major star."
m/mystic_river," A somber evocation of a poor, close-knit section of Boston on the brink of moral collapse."
m/myth_of_the_ameican_sleepover, The film likeably recognizes that all of the adolescent epiphanies worth rendering in film must be represented non-verbally.
m/nabbeun-namja-bad-guy," Though it goes on exactly a reel too long, Bad Guy reps the most emotionally satisfying pic to date by Korean iconoclast Kim Ki-duk."
m/nacho_libre," Libre is offensive, even if you take away the religious angle. It will insult your intelligence, as well as your sense of humor."
m/nadine, Maybe this film is responsible for the death of the drive-in?
m/nail_in_the_coffin_the_fall_and_rise_of_vampiro, One of the best wrestling documentaries to surface in many years.
m/nails_2017," Altogether it's a simple, but relatively satisfying, horror film."
m/naked_2017," The fact that ""Naked"" isn't ""A Haunted House 3"" is cause for celebration, but that doesn't magically make the new movie funny or particularly sweet."
m/naked_ambition_an_r_rated_look_at_an_x_rated_industry," An entertaining, adeptly crafted documentary that treats its provocative subject matter with refreshing respect."
m/naked_boys_singing," the whole exercise can't help but feel a bit zoological, as if we're watching exotic specimens on display."
m/naked_fame," What makes the film more interesting than it might have been, however, is the warm relationship between Glenn and Peter. They're two genuinely nice guys who seem to have formed very different attitudes toward their porn careers."
m/naked_gun_2_12_the_the_smell_of_fear," In the limbo of comedy, few can go lower than Zucker without visibly straining."
m/naked_prey, Has one of the better unending chase scenes for its day.
m/naked_spur," Much as I deplore Mr. James Stewart's escape from his responsibilities into the lazy histrionics of the Western, I must admit that in The Naked Spur he seizes every opportunity to act with all his familiar subtlety."
m/namesake, Mira Nair's handsome but inert adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's Pulitizer Prize winning novel is another reminder of the fact that some books were not born to be movies.
m/nancy_drew," Purportedly an attempt to modernize the young detective's adventures for a new generation of tweens, the pic instead serves up stale mystery-movie cliches and overcooked red herrings in a thoroughly wooden adaptation."
m/nancy_drew_and_the_hidden_staircase_2019," A fun, and adorable reboot, one that I think fans of the Nancy Drew series will welcome and embrace."
m/nanking," Indispensable, beautifully crafted account of a little-known Japanese massacre."
m/nanny_diaries, With the exception of Laura Linney's perceptive portrayal of Mrs. X...everything about this film falls flat beginning with Johansson's lead performance.
m/nanny_mcphee," Unfortunately, Colin Firth seems as though he's on auto-pilot and the relationship between his character and Evangeline is unconvincing, if not borderline inappropriate."
m/nanny_mcphee_returns," Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang is an emotionally engaging, pleasingly old-fashioned fantasy drama with a strong script and terrific performances. Highly recommended."
m/nanook_of_the_north," Although in some scenes it's pretty obvious that igloos have been constructed by the set designer rather than the Eskimos, there's a real beauty and an authenticity that renders these details insignificant."
m/napoleon_dynamite, plays like a demented after school special that exists in rural America but feels like it came from outer space
m/nappily_ever_after," The entirely-too-safe comedy doesn't entirely work in plotting or script, but the film still feels vital in its message."
m/napping_princess," As reality and fantasy blur, we're taken on an occasionally confounding but enchanting quest with poignant reveals in store."
m/naqoyqatsi," If you can pronounce the title, it's a good bet you'll enjoy Naqoyqatsi."
m/narc, Joe Carnahan's film smacks viewers alongside the head like a desperate junkie hunting down his fix money.
m/narco_cultura_2013," We leave the theater pondering the director's implied question, ""Why are so many innocent people in Mexico and the U.S. glorifying criminals who have murdered 60,000 Mexicans since 2006?"""
m/narcopolis," Despite the surface sheen, and some enterprising plot twists, it doesn't entirely convince."
m/nas_time_is_illmatic_2014," Time Is Illmatic is comprehensive, even wisely holistic, but still feels as though something is missing;"
m/nascar_the_imax_experience," Posits its working-class supporters not as protagonists but consumers, cheering on their just-folks race-car heroes for proxy fantasies of high-speed escape and high-tech goodies."
m/nashville," Part comedy, part drama, part social commentary, and part musical, it is a film that truly defies categorization or simplistic descriptions."
m/nasty_baby," Sebastin Silva's Nasty Baby is an amiably funny traipse through the lives of a group of coddled inner-city hipsters, until suddenly, viciously, it's not."
m/nasty_girl," It's the film's style that I object to. The story itself is fascinating, but the style seems to add another tone, a level of irony that is somehow confusing."
m/nate_and_hayes," Just when a sequence of competent action appears, yet another scene of comic silliness follows."
m/national_lampoon_s_gold_diggers, A putative comedy that manages to degrade equally those on both sides of the screen.
m/national_lampoon_s_pledge_this, So yeah. It's a National Lampoon/Paris Hilton movie that nobody wanted to release. And yet it manages to even be far worse than that.
m/national_lampoons_animal_house," One of the all-time classic movies, and a career-defining performance by Belushi make this mandatory viewing for any movie lover."
m/national_lampoons_blackball," I can think of only two explanations for its comprehensive badness. Either the director, Mel Smith, went through the script, carefully excising all the funny lines, or Firth sub-contracted the writing chores to his accountant."
m/national_lampoons_christmas_vacation," Haven't watched it in awhile, but I remember it well and I remember enjoying it. One of the better Vacation movies (Vegas Vacation is still the best, though)."
m/national_lampoons_european_vacation," It's a sophomoric and predictable little farce - but fans of the old-fashioned Chevy Chase (you know, the funny one) will find much to enjoy."
m/national_lampoons_loaded_weapon_1," It's hard to satirize a satire. That's what ""National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1"" wants to do, but the target proves elusive. This is a would-be comedy that's not as funny (nor as satirical) as the movies that inspired it."
m/national_lampoons_movie_madness," Leave this one as history has intended: unknown, forgotten, and detested by the unfortunate few who've actually seen it."
m/national_lampoons_senior_trip," There was a time when the National Lampoon name on a movie meant something, back in the days of Animal House and Vacation. Now it means something else."
m/national_lampoons_vacation, There are plenty of funny moments in this comedy that introduced the world to bumbling everyman Clark Griswold. The second best in the series after Christmas Vacation.
m/national_lampoons_van_wilder, It wanders aimlessly from scene to scene. It has no idea where it's going or where it's been.
m/national_security, It's meant to wear down and demoralize critics who are about to launch into a whole new year of worthless buddy comedies.
m/national_treasure," A smart, entertaining little adventure through American history."
m/national_treasure_book_of_secrets," It's virtually the same movie with new locations. Oh, + Helen Mirren. Not a bad addition, but the popcorn fun is gone."
m/national_velvet," One of the best horse movies; Rooney, Taylor are fine"
m/nativity-2009, On a snowy Boxing Day afternoon tucked up at home bursting with mince pies and bonhomie you might tolerate Nativity on the TV. In the glaring spotlight of the big screen it's a Christmas turkey.
m/nativity_2, Even this charming cast struggle to bring life to an overlong story that has all the sizzle of leftover turkey.
m/nativity_story," It's hard to imagine a more faithful retelling, in the religious sense, of the stories told in Luke and Matthew's New Testament, surrounding the events leading to the birth of Jesus. This is not necessarily a good thing, though."
m/natural," A nearly perfect combination of superb acting, brilliantly sweet screenwriting and a director at the top of his game."
m/natural_born_killers," Stone's attempt to break new ground with stylized visuals, MTV editing and a story that combines parody and satire, is more annoying than enlightening."
m/natural_resistance," Nossiter luxuriates in his film's casual construction, as unkempt and unruly as the old vines on the hillsides."
m/natural_selection_2011, A really beautiful performance by Harris. That's a revelation to some people but I never doubted she had it in her. Why wouldn't a successful comedian be an all around engaging thespian?
m/nature_calls," Any true emotions are snuffed out by over-the-top shock humor that, though constantly ratcheted up, is only done so to conceal the film's tonal inconsistencies and unease when it comes to big questions."
m/nature_of_existence," I didn't learn anything, but I sure had a good time laughing at the subject, which made it all worthwhile."
m/nausicaa_of_the_valley_of_the_wind," Nausica, princess of the Valley of the Wind, is a screen heroine--or, rather, hero--for the ages."
m/ne_le_dis_a_personne," Christophe Offenstein's fluid camera tracks the action well enough, but any pretence to subtlety or sophistication seems lost in translation."
m/ne_te_retourne_pas," Don't Look Back leans hard on a conventionally atonal musical score and cheap shock cuts, as well as some dubious special effects."
m/ne_zha_2019," The film remains whimsical and entertaining for adults and children alike, and its treatment of a Chinese folk deity is surprisingly accessible for audiences unfamiliar with Chinese mythology."
m/neal_brennan_3_mics," For an hour of material that entertains in a really powerful and genuine way, Brennan's 3 Mics is a must."
m/nebraska, A wistful ode to small-town Midwestern life and the quixotic dreams of stubborn old men.
m/necessary_roughness," An infectious albeit formulaic game of Cinderella football, this happy athletic romp seems to know just how wheezy it is, but the team grunts ""hut, hut,"" and puts it right on the numbers anyway."
m/neds," The humour and emotion are so sharp you might not feel them at the time, but Mullan's film cuts deep and leaves its mark."
m/need_for_speed," I don't think a single actor in Need for Speed is taller than 5-foot-6, nor would any weigh more than 70 kilos. For the first time in a long time, us out-of-shape reviewers in the screening were more intimidating than the action stars on screen."
m/needful_things," Appropriately enough, the film climaxes with a series of huge explosions, each bigger and louder than the one before."
m/negocios_sucios," With Dirty Deeds, David Caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen."
m/neighbors_2014, Zac Efron gives one of his most credible and intriguing performances in this winningly stupid frat comedy.
m/neighbors_2_sorority_rising, The film has a knowingly conflicted engagement with millennial-generation feminism that freshens its outlook even as it unevenly rejigs many of its predecessor's gags.
m/neil_young_journeys, Mr. Young's passionate cracked whine assumes an oracular power.
m/nekrotronic," Splatter-heavy, self-congratulatory horror-comedy in a ""whoa-dude"" mode that aspires to Ghostbusters or Shaun of the Dead, where evil oozes off the internet via a Pokémon-style game that captures snaps of demons."
m/nell, Nell's bell knells when her stroke-victim mother drops dead at the beginning of the film.
m/neon_bull," Though comprised of a series of beautifully framed static shots, it overflows with vitality ... you are not likely to forget it."
m/nerakhoon," Even in a city bursting with extraordinary immigrant stories, this film about a Laotian-American family's journey to Brooklyn is unusually moving."
m/nerdland_2016, This bracingly savage satire sets its sights on one of the easier targets around: the fame-lusting wannabes who will take any available short cut to claim their fifteen minutes in the spotlight.
m/nerve_2016," Blisteringly cool one moment and ridiculously silly the next, this punchy and propulsive late summer surprise is able to capture the way we live now because it displays such a vivid understanding of the reasons why we live that way."
m/net, The terror and suspense it attempts to generate are countered by the far-fetchedness of the situation it thrusts the heroine into.
m/netizens," What Netizens ultimately does is make a case for a complete rethinking of how society views women and sex, arguing that the right to privacy does not have to conflict with First Amendment concerns."
m/network, The greatest screenplay ever to remain undestroyed by Hollywood.
m/nevada_smith," The best thing that can be said about Nevada Smith is that it goes in, does what it needs to do, and gets out before it's too late."
m/never_apologize_a_personal_visit_with_lindsay_anderson_2007," McDowell's affectionate, mischievous impersonations and clips from Anderson's body of work make for an easy couple of hours."
m/never_back_down," The ethical nitwittery of ""fight so you don't have to fight again"" and invocations of The Iliad in this context brazenly transform a dumb bone-cruncher into a putridly dissembling one."
m/never_be_done," Tighe doesn't pander to the ""sad clown"" archetype, but the overall take away is that comedy may be hard, but comedians fall harder."
m/never_been_kissed," It has some warm and humorous spots, but not enough to overcome its many obstacles."
m/never_been_thawed," Never Been Thawed is a fantastic little mockumentary, and a movie it was an absolute joy to discover."
m/never_cry_wolf," The film is still memorable for its compassion, commitment, and unexpected humor, qualities that go a long way toward tempering the ecological didacticism of the screenplay."
m/never_die_alone, Half of this film is so dark and grainy it looks like the Paris Hilton sex video.
m/never_grow_old, [A] well-acted tale of frontier violence and spiritual redemption.
m/never_let_me_go_2010," Haunting, heartbreaking adaptation of the Ishiguro novel features a superb cast and inspired direction and cinematography...and a unique comingling of genres."
m/never_rarely_sometimes_always," Three films into her career, filmmaker Eliza Hittman continues to prove herself as one of contemporary cinema's most empathetic and skilled chroniclers of American youth."
m/never_say_never_again," The rank pall of opportunism hangs over this sorry rogue enterprise from producer Kevin McClory, as he tries to assemble the component parts that make up a Bond movie and fails."
m/never_sleep_again_the_elm_street_legacy-2010, An absolute must have and should be a key ingredient in any horror library...
m/never_talk_to_strangers, There's plenty of sex. There's little plot. There's reason to watch something else.
m/never_too_late_2020," An engaging cast makes it tolerable, but it ends up no more distinctive than its banal title."
m/new-port-south, A movie that feels like three hours of detention -- even though the film is only 97 minutes.
m/new-york-city-serenade, Doesn't break enough rules of the mid-1990's Sundance coming-of-age buddy template to bring any new insights to the bonds of male friendship.
m/new_best_friend, It's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure.
m/new_daughter," If they had dropped The New Daughter title, took Costner's mug off the one sheet and just called it The Mound they actually might have had a modest hit."
m/new_guy, An intriguing black comedy of the Office Space genre that rapidly descends into a Kafkaesque thriller.
m/new_in_town, This snowy Minnesota rom-com is as funny as frostbite.
m/new_jack_city," A cynical director, Van Peebles has style to burn, but his work is too flashy to make sense. This is a gangster-thriller about crack trade in Harlem done as a moralistic melodrama with kinky violence."
m/new_leaf, A film of such wit and comic invention that it belongs among the great American comedies.
m/new_life_2016," Although it aspires to be a kind of latter-day ""Love Story,"" the rote, overly earnest drama ""New Life"" exists largely on the surface."
m/new_money, New Money serves as an excellent reminder of where desperation can lead if we let it get the better of us.
m/new_twenty," Co-writer/director Chris Mason Johnson's amateur debut effort could be credited with creating a new genre of pretentious triteness tailored to define of the pop slang word ""Redonkulous."""
m/new_world_2013," Writer-director Hoon-jung Park tells this twisty story of internecine warfare within a Korean corporate crime syndicate with patience, elegance and no small amount of bloodshed."
m/new_years_eve_2011, The result proves to be as appealing and effervescent as a flute of flat champagne.
m/new_york_doll," Greg Whiteley's small, tender documentary portrait looks at life after rock 'n' roll as experienced by the original bassist for the New York Dolls."
m/new_york_i_love_you, These tales are as highly designed as fashion layouts. But they're as relaxing to thumb through as those NYT Magazine trend pieces...
m/new_york_minute, An off-putting assault of too-screwball comedy with glints of pathos.
m/new_york_ripper," The acting is bad, the dubbing atrocious, and the dialogue is even worse."
m/new_york_stories, Allen's contribution is the only one that can be counted as a genuine success.
m/newcastle," Taken as sheer sensory spectacle, Dan Castle's colorful flick is a ""Top Gun"" with waves; a ""Rocky"" with board fins..."
m/newly_single," Clark seems to have enough of a critical eye to look at the various shortcomings of Astor, and unapologetically portray the character as the jerk that he really is. Perhaps one day Astor will be as good of a director as Clark has shown himself to be."
m/newlyweds, It has both the charms and the shortcomings of the indie fringe.
m/newlyweeds_2013," Far from preachy, Newlyweeds treats its subject matter with increasingly sobering gravity, and both Cheatom and Harris embody their characters not as cartoons but as lonely, misguided souls too blazed to realize the error of their ways."
m/newsies," Its intentions seem fairly modest, and so are its achievements. It's a modestly enjoyable diversion."
m/newton_boys," Like the Newtons themselves, the film never goes for the kill."
m/newtown, Its enervated address of both mental-health treatment and gun laws receives few constructive articulations beyond a single scene.
m/next," If the protagonist of Next were to use his ability to peer two minutes into the future before watching Next, he'd probably have enough to go on to skip it altogether."
m/next_best_thing," A tone-deaf disaster of the first order, poorly acted, written with no sense of shame, clumsily staged and shot, and riddled equally with cliches, embarrassments and shocking lapses in taste, judgment and craft."
m/next_day_air," It's an oddly lethargic production, heavy in foul language and gun-pointing, but slow-witted and uninspired."
m/next_friday," And make no mistake about it, this unfunny farce is as awful as a sequel can get."
m/next_gen, The PG rating is pushed so it may not be for small children but overall I enjoyed it
m/next_goal_wins, Proves to be a charming and intoxicating sports documentary as it follows the brave and stoical attempt by American Samoa's national team to break the worst losing record in the history of the international game.
m/next_karate_kid, [It] may be the silliest episode yet in the popular Karate Kid series.
m/next_stop_wonderland, Probably the only film you'll see in a long time that affirms solitude as a perfect milieu for nurturing love.
m/next_three_days, The Next Three Days refuses to puff up its action with message-movie sermonizing.
m/ni-luo-he-nu-er-daughter-of-the-nile, Daughter of the Nile represents something special: the kind of modestly crafted masterpiece a director makes just before he comes into recognition of his own stature.
m/niagara, The real star in this film is the majestic and powerful Niagara Falls...
m/nick_and_norahs_infinite_playlist, The whole never quite registers as forcefully as individual pieces.
m/nick_of_time," Gimmicky film that takes some great actors and makes them into props. Depp plays against type, and Walken manages okay as the film operates in real time (a device used many times before and since, most recently in Fox's ""24"" TV show). Skip it."
m/nickelodeon_1976, A clunker of a comedy from Bogdanovich that aims high and misses by a mile.
m/nickys_family_2011," A great story, brilliantly told. Sir Nicholas Winton is pure inspiration. See this wonderful documentary to catch some of it..."
m/nicotina," A whole lot of dark, real-time fun in Mexico City. I hear it's better than being there. Safer, too, unless you're a character in this film."
m/night_across_the_street," Ruiz's final film is one of the cinema's grandest, most graceful farewells to life."
m/night_and_fog," Of all the films made about the Holocaust, Alain Resnais' Night and Fog (Nuit et brouillard) is quite possibly the most moving and thought-provoking,"
m/night_at_the_golden_eagle, One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters.
m/night_at_the_museum," The first half-hour's too slow; the last half-hour's too manic, as if to compensate. But at least it entertains."
m/night_at_the_museum_2," A fistful of family fun... brimming with amusing lines, great effects and a series of smart cameo performances."
m/night_at_the_museum_secret_of_the_tomb," Because when young children go to see a movie about dinosaur skeletons and a capuchin monkey who come alive at night in a museum, what they really want is to hear a divorced dad nagging his teen son about the value of an education."
m/night_at_the_roxbury," Actually, you kind of have to admire its stars, SNL cast members Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan, who remain in character throughout the movie, though even they must know it's going nowhere fast."
m/night_catches_us," Acting, particularly by Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington, is first-rate, but the story is as ramshackle as a South Philly tenement, with an equal number of structural violations."
m/night_comes_on," Like its determined heroine, ""Night Comes On"" burns with a smoldering fire, a heat that is no less intense, no less effective, for remaining largely beneath the surface."
m/night_falls_on_manhattan, Its maker's best since 1988's Running on Empty and maybe even '82's The Verdict.
m/night_hunter_2019," The film's starry cast will be a strong selling point, but a plot that's overly complicated rather than genuinely complex may leave audiences wishing for less incident and more clarity."
m/night_in_casablanca," Point some of that blame at the cumbersome screenplay and lackluster director Archie Mayo, a.k.a. 'that fat idiot' to Groucho, who said Mayo 'emasculated' the picture."
m/night_moves," An unusual detective story that points out that in a world of rampant deception, we can't believe in winners anymore"
m/night_moves_2013," The conclusion, like the rest of the film...will be ticking around our heads for a while, and proved to be the perfect reminder that Reichardt is one of the most exciting directorial talents we have right now."
m/night_of_the_creeps, virtually every frame of the film is a love letter to a bygone era as realized in the vibrant tones of the music-video-addled '80s
m/night_of_the_demons, A raucous and very novel horror film that hasn't aged a bit.
m/night_of_the_demons_2009, A load of overwrought nonsense in which the souls of seven twentysomethings are imperilled when they disturb the undead quietly mouldering in the basement.
m/night_of_the_generals," The producer, Sam Spiegel, and director, Anatole Litvak hurl themselves at all this with rather fretful intensity, as though persuaded that out of such huffing and puffing a significant statement must emerge... it doesn't."
m/night_of_the_hunter," If you hear cineastes discussing the film in hushed tones, it's only because Mitchum and Laughton have conspired to get under our skins and tattoo their story on our bones."
m/night_of_the_iguana," Films of Tennessee Williams' plays now often look very artificial and overwrought, but with this Huston came up with one of the best."
m/night_of_the_lepus, Impossible not to admire the total withholding of irony in Claxton's approach to this kamikaze project.
m/night_of_the_living_deb, Night of the Living Deb takes the awkward morning after and makes it even more ridiculous with zombies. This indie zombie charmer is definitely one you should see.
m/night_of_the_shooting_stars, Directors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani have brought a sense of premorality both to the composition of the images and the shape of the narrative.
m/night_on_earth," ""Night on Earth"" sounds better than it turns out to be."
m/night_porter," Not rich in plausability of plot or character development, but tonally interesting in places."
m/night_school_2018," Night School is a dim-witted, slapstick comedy that runs painfully long. A supporting cast of great comedians saves the film from being a total loss."
m/night_shift, This early Ron Howard comedy has no shortage of laugh-out-loud moments thanks to Michael Keaton's unforgettable screen debut as manic wildman Bill Blazejowski.
m/night_sweats," Run of the mill movie about deadly disease, but there is a nice twist to it all."
m/night_train_to_lisbon_2013," Mystery romantic thriller whose execution fails to live up to its superlative cast. Based on Pascal Mercier's novel, Bille August's film struggles to marry the story's two timeframes with the narrative leapfrogging back and forth"
m/night_watch_2006, The preponderance of elaborate mumbo jumbo becomes an unbearable drag.
m/night_will_fall," Inevitably and immeasurably affecting, but conventional in terms of what it says."
m/nightbreed, Disappointing make-up showcase disguised as a thriller.
m/nightcomers," ...positively reviewed upon initial release, and Brando was nominated for a BAFTA, but I can't for the life of me figure out why."
m/nightcrawler," Gyllenhaal, who summons career-best work, simply couldn't have played this character a few years ago."
m/nightingale_2015," It's a gutsy piece of work, leaving the audience to contemplate the details once it's all over."
m/nightjohn," A wonderful, fully realized work-passionate, stirring, and beautiful."
m/nightlight_2015," ""Nightlight"" is a perfect example of a film with interesting ideas that are totally smothered by poor execution."
m/nightmare_before_christmas," Wonderfully dark and moody children's Halloween tale that gently stirs all of the required elements of humour, musical charisma, children's imagination and amazing special effects in a successful simmering pot of entertainment."
m/nightmare_cinema," I had a good time with it, and for the Dante segment alone it's a must-see."
m/nightmare_man," All impenetrably dark nighttime shots, politely telegraphed shocks and limp, transparent misogyny masquerading as genre-savvy hijinks."
m/nightmare_on_elm_street, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a movie defined by its dual legacies.
m/nightmare_on_elm_street_2010," One dreary jump scare after another, without a moment to breathe, show something revealing about one of its doomed teens, or deliver a single line of dialogue that isn't dully and directly on-point."
m/nightmares," Plenty of short-story-type twists ensure that the ensuing drama plays second fiddle to cheap, unsatisfying pay-offs."
m/nights_in_rodanthe," It's the sort of film, frankly, one either utterly succumbs to or stubbornly resists, and those opting for the former course shouldn't be disappointed."
m/nights_of_cabiria," A deep, wrenching and eloquent filmgoing experience."
m/nims_island, So why does Nim's Island feel so charmless and rote? Perhaps it's because the film feels like an amalgam of other movies' plotlines.
m/ninas_heavenly_delights," In her feature debut, filmmaker Pratibha Parmar falls back on every clich she's supposedly trying to undermine."
m/nine_2009," Nine is simply sensational and is indeed a worthy successor to his Best Picture winner, Chicago in every way."
m/nine_lives_2016, It almost goes without saying that the cat-themed family comedy Nine Lives generates fewer laughs than 87 minutes of random cat videos off YouTube -- but it's more surprising that the movie is less coherent and has lower production value
m/nine_months," Nine Months is one of those movies where the outcome is abundantly clear to everyone but the hero, who remains in the hapless position of playing dumb because, if he didn't, there wouldn't be a plot."
m/ninotchka," Ernst Lubitsch may have thought he was only poking fun at another country, but he was actually poking fun at the future."
m/ninth_configuration," Brilliant, funny, moving examination of faith from Blatty."
m/ninth_gate, The filmmaker takes you on a journey that goes absolutely nowhere.
m/nitro_circus_the_movie_3d_2012, [VIDEO ESSAY]...an eye-popping celebration of a talented and fearless stunt crew unafraid to put their lives on the line. Taste the adrenaline babyface.
m/nixon, Casting Anthony Hopkins was a stroke of unexpected genius.
m/no-blade-of-grass, This potentially powerful material is unfortunately dealt with too melodramatically.
m/no_2012," The film provides a fascinating history lesson in the guise of backstage drama, honeycombed with antique-looking TV commercials full of Lycra-clad dancers and gambolling mimes."
m/no_alternative_2018," Although some aspects of No Alternative felt a bit heavy handed in the script department, it's an accomplished film nonetheless, one that delivers a well-crafted look at youth in revolt."
m/no_country_for_old_men," The Coens' typically superior filmmaking sustains the electrifying mood for most of the picture, but they are undone by being too faithful to the source novel by Cormac McCarthy."
m/no_end_in_sight," A damning critique conducted with surgical precision, Ferguson's Sundance Festival prize-winning film is arguably one of the most comprehensive and rigorous docus about the failures of the Bush administration vis-a-vis the Iraq War."
m/no_escape_2015," This isn't lightweight, fanciful entertainment; it's tense, white-knuckle material."
m/no_escape_2020," No Escape is a film that contains no thrills, no chills, and no earthly reason to even exist."
m/no_good_deed, This undermarketed noir suffers because many of its characters don't seem to belong in the same universe.
m/no_good_deed_2013," Screen Gems celebrates Violence Against Women Awareness Week with a brutal thriller about, you guessed it, a psychopath committing all sorts of violence against women."
m/no_good_reason," Ultimately it's a fan letter, full of more awe and loving than ""Fear and Loathing,"" and meant mostly for other admirers."
m/no_holds_barred," Barred is tremendously crude, unapologetically manipulative (Zeus finally breaks down Rip's reserve by crippling his kid brother), and aimed directly at easily entertained 13-year-old boys."
m/no_manches_frida, No Manches Frida tries wildly to delight but goes nowhere. It is the cinematic equivalent to the cringeworthy class clown at the back of the room that everyone ignores. It's just embarrassing.
m/no_manches_frida_2," The Chaparro-Higareda formula works, although sometimes... the conflicts in No Manches Frida 2 are predictable. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/no_mans_land," The spirit of MASH runs through this sharply observed, absurdly funny take on the folly of war."
m/no_men_beyond_this_point," With such a compelling premise, the film definitely keeps your interest and is at times very smart, but it just misses."
m/no_no_a_dockumentary, A film so vital and full of life that it almost becomes essential.
m/no_one_killed_jessica," The narrative is gripping, the music score uplifting, the screenplay tight enough to allow for very few slippages."
m/no_one_knows_about_persian_cats," Bahman Ghobadi's exploration into the world of underground music in Tehran is a welcome antidote to the blas, pedestrian, apathetic state of the music industry in the West."
m/no_one_lives, No One Lives is never quite able to recapture the gloriousness of its opening half hour...
m/no_pay_nudity_2016, Winningly bittersweet despite its frustratingly slight lapses.
m/no_place_on_earth," The incredible but true story of a Jewish family that hid from the Nazis in a cave for 511 days, done as a hybrid of documentary and narrative."
m/no_reservations," Even though it is a romantic comedy, there is too much miserableness going round for the film to be truly enjoyable."
m/no_se_aceptan_devoluciones," Derbez, who also directed the film, gives the movie a strong core through his expressive face."
m/no_small_affair," Utterly inconsequential, but it at least provides a nostalgic look at its stars circa 1984."
m/no_small_matter, No Small Matter finds many persuasive ways to suggest America should reexamine its priorities.
m/no_stranger_than_love," It has that feeling of a piece that needed a bit more workshopping to discern its purpose and, like a lot of independent cinema that feels like it has theatrical origins, never becomes convincingly cinematic."
m/no_strings_attached_2011," At times, No Strings Attached feels almost shockingly attuned to the particular angst of its time and place."
m/no_such_thing," By the end of No Such Thing the audience, like Beatrice, has a watchful affection for the monster."
m/no_turning_back," It bolts out of the blocks tugging a crate full of bricks, two wrecking balls, and a cruise-ship anchor."
m/no_way_to_treat_a_lady, A terrific mystery thriller that's both suspenseful and human. Segal is especially winning.
m/noah_2014," A work of art and imagination that makes this most familiar of tales strange and new, at times illuminating the text, at times stretching it to the breaking point."
m/noahs_arc_jumping_the_broom, Jumping the Broom exalts an underserved audience yet Polk's discussion of the socio-economic connection of slavery and contemporary gay politics doesn't patronize them.
m/noble_2014," A feisty, passionate performance by the Irish actress Deirdre O'Kane gives the inspirational biopic ""Noble"" a serrated edge of defiance and gumption."
m/nobody_else_but_you, Succeeds in breathing fresh life into the 'meet-quirky-locals-while-solving-a-crime' genre.
m/nobody_walks, Insightful look at how a young woman serves as a catalyst for sexual mayhem within an L.A. family unit.
m/nobodys_fool_2018," It's another Tyler Perry film with a lot of lessons, and I don't want to come off like I'm looking down on that (which I don't), but good lessons don't necessarily add up to a good movie."
m/nocturnal_animals, The sort of narratively bold exercise in page-turning suspense and cinematic class that used to be synonymous with Hollywood.
m/noel, Hubbard's script is so steeped in sludgy sentimentality that the film's early hints of quirkiness quickly give way to heavy-handed faith healing.
m/noi-the-albino, A terrific picture crouched in the centre of a blasted Icelandic winter.
m/noise," Much emphasis has been placed on the sound design, ably created by Emma Bortignon, but after a while, the constant sounds irritate and detract from the story."
m/noises_off, Extremely energetic theater farce benefits from a colorful (and inexhaustable) ensemble.
m/nola, Combines a worn-out premise -- young woman leaves unhappy home for big city -- with some of the silliest characters ever to reach the screen.
m/noma_my_perfect_storm, Slick but always sharp in the best contemporary European nonfiction fashion.
m/nomad," Despite the central Asian locale, the film is largely rooted in the conventions of the American westerns and good old Hollywood Biblical epics like The Ten Commandments, as well as many of their attendant clichs."
m/nomads," I would like to describe the plot of Nomads, but my space is limited."
m/nomi_song," Chronicles the short and haunting life of Klaus Sperber, a trained classical singer from Essen, Germany, who came to New York as a young man in the late 1970's."
m/non-ma-fille-tu-niras-pas-danser-2009," This study of a difficult woman, without a truly electrifying actress in the role, never catches fire."
m/non_si_deve_profanare_il_sonno_dei_morti_1974," Scenic settings, guts, and a residual contact high from the counterculture movement converge in one of the zombie genre's most unique and enjoyable entries."
m/non_stop_2013," Liam Neeson, with his towering frame and credible persona, is an asset to any film (but)... too many distractions by way of character overload and red herrings"
m/norbit," In Norbit, Eddie Murphy is like a xylophone player who keeps banging away on the same two discordant notes; unfortunately, those monotonous, off-key tones are the characters he's playing."
m/norm_of_the_north," Last year at this time we had ""Paddington"" to relieve the blahs. Unfortunately, ""Norm of the North"" is no ""Paddington!"""
m/normal_life, recommended only for fans of Judd -- and I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.
m/norman," A would-be dark, self-congratulatory dramedy that lacks both transgressive laughter and honest engagement with its themes of death and teen depression."
m/norman_2017," The tragedy stems from Richard Gere's superb portrayal of ""a drowning man waving at an ocean liner""-demolishing his elegant image with a study of bottomless need and misapplied largesse"
m/norman_lear_just_another_version_of_you, An entertaining documentary on the television writer and producer who pioneered socially relevant television in America.
m/norte_the_end_of_history," More than four hours long, filmed in expansive takes with almost no close-ups and very few camera movements, Lav Diaz's ""Norte, the End of History"" is a tour de force of slow cinema."
m/north," It's a prime example of what can happen when hip, slightly cynical establishment filmmakers try to make a deeply sentimental movie."
m/north-by-northwest," Of course, the hallmark of North by Northwest is the way in which Hitchcock develops tension."
m/north_country, Charlize Theron gives an excellently modulated performance as Josey Aimes.
m/north_dallas_forty," Pro football fans may be disillusioned by this excellent, honest, and often brutal expose of the play-for-pay game."
m/north_face, Slogs through an hour of frequently rote exposition until it hits its riveting groove when the rappelling and piton-hammering take over.
m/north_sea_texas," Complicated nicely by the unrequited crush of Vergels' sister on their friend, it's a film of supple visual flair and delicately acted appeal: Florizoone in particular is the bee's knees."
m/north_to_alaska," I can't in good conscience call this one of John Wayne's best movies, but I have to say that 'North to Alaska' has always been one of my favorites. It's just plain fun."
m/northern_light_2014," Gets past the Joe Six-Pack, NASCAR fan stereotypes and shows you how ordinary working class people work and play. Given the deepening class divisions in the USA, a film that illuminates how people survive psychologically."
m/northern_soul, This passionate evocation of the '70s northern soul scene hits bum notes for character and story.
m/northfork," Like the best work of David Lynch, Northfork is that rare movie that draws you in more (rather than alienating you) at precisely those moments when you least understand it."
m/northwest_passage," Surprisingly gritty, realistic MGM version of early pioneers led by Spencer Tracy's Rogers."
m/norwegian_wood," Even if this Haruki Murakami adaptation amounts to a gorgeous but lethargic emo ballad, there's no denying the stately lyricism of its melancholy."
m/nos_enfants_nous_accuseront," An entertaining documentary that presents a blueprint for bringing organic, healthy and socially responsible food production and preparation to local communities."
m/nosferatu," It doesn't scare us, but it haunts us. It shows not that vampires can jump out of shadows, but that evil can grow there, nourished on death."
m/nosferatu_the_vampyre, The movie challenges us with images and emotions that have hardly ever been seen before.
m/nostalgia_1984," Instead of excitement, the feeling one gets after seeing Nostalghia is one of utter relaxation that makes us long for the world we left behind in the theater."
m/nostalgia_2018," While it would be unfair to call this feature a two-hour compilation of crying scenes, it comes awfully close to being just that."
m/nostalgia_for_the_light," Political filmmaker Patricio Guzman brings together the heavens and the earth in Nostalgia for the Light, a meditation on history, memory and the cosmos."
m/not_another_happy_ending," A hodge-podge of random-seeming creative flourishes conspire with the film's general lack of believability to make the characters seem not so much off the wall, as completely demented."
m/not_another_teen_movie," Not only is it consistently clever, but it has respect for many of the movies it lampoons."
m/not_easily_broken, Not Easily Broken is a marriage-in-crisis melodrama baked from the Tyler Perry recipe.
m/not_fade_away_2012," In his feature debut, Chase (Sopranos creator) walks a fine line between a familiar, sentimental coming of age tale and more personal and idiosyncratic meditation on how music shapes both personal identity and collective consciousness."
m/not_one_less," For Chinese viewers, this film will play as a human drama. For Western viewers, there's almost equal interest at the edges of the screen, in the background, in the locations and incidental details that show daily life in today's China."
m/not_quite_hollywood, a startling and very funny new feature-length documentary exploring the outrageous Ozploitation cinema made in Australia in the 1970s and '80s.
m/not_suitable_for_children, Not Suitable For Children is a refreshingly solid and raw Australian 'dramedy' that delivers poignant characters and relieving laughs while highlighting our fragile and absurdly fleeting existence.
m/not_yet_begun_to_fight, This intimate documentary presents a human face on the corrosive effects of war.
m/note_by_note_the_making_of_steinway_l1037, Infomercials are seldom this leisurely paced or austere.
m/notebook, Occasionally it's nice to remember that actual photography is a part of filmmaking.
m/notes_on_a_scandal," What begins as a witty and subtle chronicle of female friendship, loneliness and panic escalates into a melodramatic tabloid saga with lots of screaming, but Judi Dench is exquisite and her voice-over narration is masterful, stressing every syllabus"
m/notes_on_blindness," A mature, respectable, gently moving discussion that lacks a killer hook."
m/nothing_bad_can_happen," Tore Tanzt is a hard movie to watch on occasion, but it's powered by some fundamental questions."
m/nothing_but_the_truth_2008," It's junk with a serious-faced, point-making agenda."
m/nothing_in_common," Nothing in Common wants to surprise us by inserting tragedy in the midst of laughter, but the problem is, the serious parts of this movie are so much more interesting than the lightweight parts that the whole project gets out of balance."
m/nothing_left_to_fear, It's stale B-movie rubbish of a barely watchable sort.
m/nothing_like_the_holidays," Falling somewhere between a telenovela and a sitcom's big holiday show, Nothing Like the Holidays mixes family melodrama with the good cheer of the season, all with a distinct Latin flavor."
m/notorious_betty_page," Like Bettie herself, the movie is wholesome and sexy at the same time. I liked it immensely."
m/notte," Whatever one's occasional misgivings, this feature comes from what is widely considered to be Antonioni's richest period, and evidence of his stunning mastery is available throughout."
m/notting_hill," It's funny, sympathetic, mostly smart, and it boasts a likable cast of characters led by two performers who have star power and know how to use it."
m/nous-ne-vieillirons-pas-ensemble-we-wont-grow-old-together," A wild, furious, and genuinely unsettling ego is on display in Maurice Pialat's second proper feature."
m/november_criminals, The film advances that old Hollywood trope: Blacks can't get justice unless whites are willing to get it for them.
m/novitiate," Novitiate captures something many religious people can understand: the idea that beating oneself (both figuratively and, sometimes, literally) as an act of devotion will make God love us more than he loves other people."
m/novocaine, a hopelessly over-plotted tale where the players are jerked around by the whims of story line rather than character development
m/now_and_later," Shrilly over-written and artlessly directed by Philippe Diaz, and with the same presumptuousness he brought to the documentary The End of Povery?"
m/now_and_then, It's a pleasure watching these four legendary women interact.Moore's quirky neuroticism and amazing all-black wardrobe are a treat to watch.
m/now_is_good_2012," You'll be in bits, but your critical faculties might weep too."
m/now_voyager," Now, Voyager (1942) is the quintessential, soap-opera or ""woman's picture"" ('weepie') and one of Bette Davis' best-acted and remembered films, coming shortly"
m/now_you_see_him_now_you_dont," Benefiting from some fine special effects, this fast-moving comedy ought to please any family."
m/now_you_see_me," The characters themselves tell you that you're too close to see the big picture. As it turns out, the movie is the same way."
m/now_you_see_me_2," No less than in the glossy caper's 2013 predecessor, the plot rides a surging tide of ridiculousness and culminates in a pileup of unconvincing explanations."
m/nowhere_boy," There is something a bit bland, a bit kitchen sink, a bit telemovie, about this portrait of the artist as a young man."
m/nowhere_to_hide_2000," Don't look for a complex plot -- it's nowhere to be found in Nowhere to Hide. But with this much visual style, who needs it?"
m/nuclear_nation_2012, A minimalist look at the destruction of the city of Futaba in the wake of the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear plants.
m/number_37," In Number 37, director Nosipho Dumisa has paid tribute to a classic, while simultaneously building something completely her own. Hitchcock would be proud."
m/nurse_2013," ...a visually enticing hour and a half that is willing to do just about anything to excite. High art it is not, but if you are looking for a good time you might want to give this NURSE a call."
m/nurse_betty," Nurse Betty is never going to be confused with Mary Poppins, but as of now, it's LaBute's crowd pleaser."
m/nursery_university," There's wicked fun in watching the wealthy sweat the small stuff, but this documentary has empathy for parents of all incomes."
m/nuts," A surprisingly compelling courtroom drama, which only lapses into Hollywood gloss at the end when Streisand delivers a mannered, close-up monologue."
m/nutty_professor_ii_the_klumps, One has to stretch even to identify such ephemeral instances of real humor in this bloated morass of a movie.
m/o," Comes across as a potent drama, extremely well-acted by its leads."
m/o_brother_where_art_thou," This is a lighter story than many of the Coens' previous movies, which makes it easy to forgive the parts that don't work very well."
m/o_lucky_man," Courts brilliance by tempering its cynicism with a hefty dose of protracted, but never quite gullible, innocence in its main character."
m/o_som_ao_redor_2012," Charged with an air of impending danger, the movie just keeps building."
m/oasis_2003," Lee Chang-dong's miraculous love story is the find of the [59th Venice] festival!...a gritty, urban spin on John Cromwell's post-war classic, The Enchanted Cottage."
m/oasis_supersonic," Whether you're Team Liam or Team Noel, Whitecross's film does what good retrospective rock-docs should: makes a seismic moment for rock's history books roar with raucously entertaining life again."
m/object_of_my_affection, It's difficult to get an audience to root for disagreable protagonists in a love story.
m/objectified," A documentary that could have been more involving to people outside design careers if director Hustwit edited out some of the long, tedious monologues in favor of showing more products with exciting designs."
m/oblivion_2013," Intelligent, innovative and intimate sci-fi is always welcome, but Oblivion isn't quite it."
m/obscene, This is the kind of art house documentary that inspires the right kind of social rebellion.
m/observe_and_report," If you think full frontal male nudity, ""Old Boy""-style asskickings, date rape, and elderly incontinence are hilarious, you are in for a treat."
m/obvious_child," Hats off to Robespierre and Slate. They've managed to deliver a film with actual edge, which somehow retains the characteristics that any successful romantic comedy should have."
m/occupation_2018," When straining for significance, slow motion is his answer every time and the lameness of his ending is infused with a risible shot of sentimentality."
m/ocean_waves_2016," Hardcore fans expecting ""Spirited Away"" will be better off going in to this interesting teen drama looking for something more in the arena of ""Whisper of the Heart."""
m/oceans_11, A heist flick that counts on its coolness -- and a remarkably downbeat ending -- for its success.
m/oceans_8, Combining star talent with celebrities results in a an effective combination. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/oceans_eleven," The acting was great, the story was fun with good dialogue, and it was enjoyable."
m/oceans_thirteen," As smooth as a good mojito, as stylish as an Armani suit and as meaningful in the grand scheme of things as yesterday's Las Vegas betting odds, Ocean's Thirteen continues the breezy good times of the first two series entries without missing a beat."
m/oceans_twelve," A time capsule of the current A-list first and a motion picture second, it'd make a great calendar: one idol per month."
m/octagon," It's ambitious work but not always successful, with director Eric Karson biting off a little more than he can chew when it comes time to build momentum with such a top-heavy film."
m/october_baby_2011," An apolitical, pro-life parable apt to touch the hearts of audience members on either side of the abortion issue."
m/october_country_2009," If the film doesn't get anywhere narratively, that's just form following content: The Moshers themselves don't go anywhere, either."
m/october_gale," There's an Old Hollywood romanticism to Mischa Chillak's music, underscoring the noirish elements in Nadda's subdued and intimate thriller, where regret is as deadly as a firearm."
m/october_sky," A professionally crafted family film that reserves all its challenging moments for its characters, letting the audience bask comfortably in the approach of a predetermined warm and fuzzy ending."
m/octopussy, Octopussy is a very minor entry in the Bond franchise.
m/oculus," Oculus isn't scary. It's an idea of what might be frightening, but it never delivers on its solid potential"
m/odd_brodsky," ""Odd Brodsky"" is an off-kilter charmer populated by quirky characters."
m/odd_couple_ii, The audience shares vicariously in their silly little episodes.
m/odd_thomas," When a movie directed by Stephen Sommers doesn't even get a theatrical release, you know something's up."
m/oddball_and_the_penguins, Oddball and the Penguins is a boldly unsophisticated kids' film from Australia that recalls the world of Disney TV movies from the 1950s.
m/ode_to_joy_2019, Ode to Joy is about a man with a disease that causes him to pass out whenever he experiences pleasure. He'd be safe seeing this movie.
m/of_gods_and_men," It is not often we are swept up, even exalted, by earnest simplicity."
m/of_men_and_war," Of Men and War refuses to mask or simplify the harsh realities of PTSD. This stubbornness, an insistence that the roughness of war be taken seriously, makes the film an essential document of 21st century American conflict."
m/of_unknown_origin, It's ultimately clear that Of Unknown Origin might've worked as a half hour short yet is simply unable to sustain an 88 minute running time...
m/off-the-map," A film of quiet beauty, striking comedy and touching truths."
m/off_and_running_2010," Director Nicole Opper never resorts to promoting reductive, campus counselor-esque values."
m/offence, It's highly theatrical -- perhaps just a little too highly theatrical for the more or less realistic context -- but it's been staged by Lumet for maximum effect.
m/office_christmas_party," A busy but witless and stale comedy that rehashes every raunchy gag we expect from R-rated comedies, it also wears its hackneyed sentimentality and cookie-cutter underdog story beats as proudly as adhesive nametags."
m/office_space, Runs out of steam while meandering through what becomes a less than inspired comedy caper.
m/officer_and_a_gentleman," An Officer and a Gentleman is the best movie about love that I've seen in a long time. Maybe that's because it's not about ""love"" as a Hollywood concept, but about love as growth, as learning to accept other people for who and what they are."
m/officer_downe," When Crahan is on, there's a hardcore griminess to Officer Downe that's sadistically stylized and punishingly powerful."
m/official_secrets, Director Gavin Hood tells an unremarkable story about Katherine Gun's remarkable bravery.
m/offside," A quietly intelligent and humorous alternative look at football, pop culture and the position of women."
m/ogrod_rozkoszy_ziemskich," You're either going to love this film and run out to see everything Majewski has directed, or you're going to be bored silly."
m/oh_god," Burns is everything we could hope for in a benevolent God--a kindly, reassuring voice; a sympathetic smile; a modest, unassuming manner; everyone's favorite uncle."
m/oh_god_book_ii," Oh, God! Book II offers plenty of food for thought on the nature of God, the meaning of faith, the limits of psychiatry, and the importance of story-telling."
m/oh_what_a_lovely_war, An anti-war musical whose originality has never been successfully repeated.
m/ohorten, Bent Hamer's unique blend of absurdist humour and aching melancholy has never worked better than in O' Horten.
m/okami_kodomo_no_ame_to_yuki," The detailed Ghibli-esque visuals are decent enough, but this is disappointingly bland."
m/okja," The weakness of the film is that it really should be for children, but the amount of swearing and violence is clearly aimed at an adult audience."
m/oklahoma," ...Zinnemann manages to keep the pace moving in the right direction, and any small concerns one may have diminish quickly in light of the rest of the movie's delights."
m/old_and_new," It's a bucolic epic about the Soviet struggle to collectivize agricultural production, and it's far from his least interesting or exciting film."
m/old_fashioned," Old Fashioned is excruciatingly dull. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. I had to force myself to stop looking at my watch, because it was discouraging how little time had gone by whenever I checked."
m/old_goats," A low-key, homemade pleasure; a quiet, appealing film about a late chapter in life."
m/old_joy, An evocative and melancholy portrait of two men whose friendship has run its course.
m/old_school, Though not as gross-out as 'American Pie' 'Old School' comically subverts the adage 'You can't go home again.'
m/old_stone," For the most part, Mr. Ma just pulls you along, keeping you close to Lao Shi with focused storytelling and agitated camerawork, creating a sense of intimacy that can border on the claustrophobic."
m/old_yeller," Every bit the warm, comfortable, and tragically bittersweet classic that had you sobbing like a infant the first time you saw it."
m/oldboy," The more of the plot's secrets are revealed, the more laughable it becomes."
m/oldboy_2013," The change in velocity actually helps the remake stand out, creating a film experience that pays service to what came before, yet succeeds in carving out something of its own."
m/oleanna," Zeroes in on the lust for power that lies behind the confrontations waged in the name of gender, class, age, and political correctness."
m/oliver," An exciting experience for young viewers, and is substantial enough for those who want some tension along with the fluffy songs."
m/oliver_and_company," Simply put, Oliver & Company didn't work for me not because I'm many years past my sixth birthday but because it never scared me into forgetting that fact."
m/oliver_twist_1951," Classic Dickens ... the definitive version. Please, sir, we want some more!"
m/olivia_2019," Olivia is an entertainingly scripted scenario of repressed lust, exemplified in every possibly way, but quite brilliantly through a script filled with observational bon mots."
m/olympic_dreams," You realize that in pairing an athlete's mentality with an artist's imagination, the filmmakers behind ""Olympic Dreams"" articulate a truly beautiful way of looking at the world, all the more so in pulling the curtain back on parts of it we've never seen."
m/olympus_has_fallen_2013," Fuqua has made a mean, tense (often silly), gung-ho thriller-actioner, which doesn't allow any member of its talented cast to develop a relatable character."
m/om_shanti_om," As a spoof of the 1970s Bollywood, Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om is well-conceived and executed. As a story about reincarnation, it disappoints."
m/omar," Despite a conventional narrative arc and lulls in the rhythm, the film is a powerfully directed look at hopes and relationships ravaged by the world's most intractable conflict."
m/omega_man, Heston [is] an uncompromisingly masculine presence as well as multi-layered mind who's always riveting. The Omega Man affected me in a way few movies ever had.
m/omen, Moore's approach fails entirely to capitalise on Damien's creepiness and he might have best been left out entirely; the only adrenaline-pumping moments in the film come from the jump-scares throughout.
m/omen_iv_the_awakening," An attempt to revive the franchise in the chintziest way possible, with a film made for network television."
m/on-the-bowery-1957," Fascinating for urban and film historians, but also a moving tribute to film's timeless power to illuminate social issues. See with new The Perfect Team:The Making of."
m/on_a_clear_day_you_can_see_forever," Despite its numerous faults, it succeeds as a Streisand showcase"
m/on_a_magical_night, Maybe more scenes with just Maria and Richard (present-day) would have given more insight into their relationship.
m/on_body_and_soul," Delicate psychological insight, a strong aesthetic signature and two affecting, restrained performances by Alexandra Borbély and Géza Morcsányi overcome any familiarity, as well as occasional hints of preciousness."
m/on_chesil_beach," The lead actors are both marvellous... Yet the film's most impressive performance might come from director Dominic Cooke, who has delivered an assured, wistful debut."
m/on_dangerous_ground_1952," Perched between late-'40s noir and mid-'50s crime drama, this is one of the great, forgotten works of the genre."
m/on_deadly_ground, The ultimate problem with any Steven Seagal project is that it must inevitably star Steven Seagal.
m/on_golden_pond," The cinematic equivalent of shrink-wrapping, in which all of the ideas, feelings, characters, and images are neatly separated and hermetically sealed to prevent spoilage, abrasion, or any contact with the natural world."
m/on_guard," The cast has a high time, but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp."
m/on_her_majestys_secret_service," Lazenby makes the mistake of trying to imitate Connery rather than giving his own interpretation to the role, and as we all know, imitations just make us yearn for the genuine article."
m/on_line," A smart, well-made film that treads new ground in the relationship wilderness."
m/on_the_basis_of_sex," For On the Basis of Sex, which shrinks in the shadow of the successful documentary RBG from last spring, missing details and character motivations become crucial missteps in a film that is still probably guaranteed to be an inspirational crowdpleaser."
m/on_the_beach_at_night_alone," Unfussy in form, open in expression and gentle in reach as its maker revisits such recurring preoccupations as loneliness, regret and the value of love in life and art."
m/on_the_ice," If only because of the setting, this is an uncommonly involving thriller. I could call it a film noir, except that the sun never sets in the film."
m/on_the_job," The film manages to create some moments of genuine nervous tension, but is undercut by its split storytelling."
m/on_the_one," One just wishes that with the word 'choir' in the title, there would be a lot more top-drawer gospel singing."
m/on_the_outs, A powerful blending of three independent yet crossing stories from the wasted dead ends of life.
m/on_the_road," This is On the Road as experienced by someone who exhibits no personality, a story of self-discovery in which there's no self to discover."
m/on_the_road_with_judas," Clever and moderately entertaining, film is a puzzle that will find some supporters as surely as it will sharply divide audiences."
m/on_the_ropes, The filmmakers convey Harry and his fighters' victories and defeats with a soul-rocking combination of intimacy and intricacy.
m/on_the_waterfront, Screenwriter Budd Schulberg's exposé of the corruption in the dock workers' unions won eight Oscars and remains as stirring as ever -- as does the performance of Marlon Brando.
m/once," The magic of the movie is how utterly wrenching it renders [its] songs, which thrive alongside the film's simple, eloquent, dusky narrative."
m/once_bitten, That eighties guilty pleasure I go back to again and again for a good chuckle.
m/once_i_was_a_beehive," It's hard not to smile at a movie that respects faith for its power to comfort, heal and unite."
m/once_in_the_life, The pingpong repetition of dialogue is more precious than poetic and heavy silences and actorly asides draw out a slim story that packs few dramatic surprises.
m/once_upon_a_deadpool," In the end, the whole clean-up project is as shrug-worthy as most of the ""Unrated Director's Cut!"" edits that go the other direction on home video, promising more nudity and gore but changing little of consequence."
m/once_upon_a_forest," It's a good thing this breezy animated adventure lasts only slightly more than 70 minutes. Children will no doubt enjoy its simple tale, but would probably grow restless if it went on for a minute longer."
m/once_upon_a_time_in_america, A lazily haullucinatory epic that means to encapsulate approximately 50 years of American social history into a single film.
m/once_upon_a_time_in_anatolia, A cinematic experience that lingers long in the mind and demands repeat viewings.
m/once_upon_a_time_in_brooklyn_2013," Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn's vision of the Mafia comes filtered through a needlessly complex screenplay, as if the creators felt the need to prove they've seen a few Arnaud Desplechin films alongside Goodfellas."
m/once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood," The film is at least a reflection of Tarantino on his own figure, where he dismantles all the features of what his filmography represents to reassemble them in another episode of historical revisionism. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/once_upon_a_time_in_mexico," Audiences, I believe, are going to want to see another dose of the first two films; they don't want the headache of trying to figure out what the heck is going on for two hours."
m/once_upon_a_time_in_the_west," With its amazing widescreen compositions and epic running time, this Western truly wins points for length and width."
m/once_upon_a_time_in_venice," Uneven and not especially funny, but at least Willis seems to be making an honest effort."
m/once_were_warriors," It is an impressive first feature for its director, Lee Tamahori, and a splendid dramatic vehicle for its stars, especially Rena Owen."
m/ondine," Quite what Neil Jordan thought he was doing is hard to say, beyond hooking Farrell up with a mail-order ingénue and unveiling the least lustrous visuals ever composed by Chris Doyle who very possibly spent the shoot asleep in a puddle of Guinness."
m/one-on-one," Attractive if soft-centred basketball story, a sort of junior Rocky."
m/one_2000, A moving and elegantly delivered drama about the waning of a friendship.
m/one_and_two_2015," There are simply too many loose ends to distract us, and too much empty air in which audiences can't help but poke holes."
m/one_bad_cat," The film finds its footing whenever Johnny Coleman, professor of African-American Studies and Fine Arts at Oberlin College in Ohio, speaks openly about Wagner's troublesome images and the appeal those images have for whites."
m/one_bright_shining_moment," ""The Establishment... has led us into the stupidest and cruelest war in all history. That war is political disaster - a terrible cancer eating away at the soul of our nation."""
m/one_crazy_summer," Quirky, fun comedy with John Cusack - classic 80's summer fare"
m/one_day_2014," Anne Hathaway's faux British accent might be the first obvious conceit in ""One Day,"" but not its most cumbersome. That distinction belongs to the eponymous structure."
m/one_eyed_jacks," Stylish Brando produced, directed, starring western."
m/one_fall," This portrait of a miracle worker needed some real miracle workers to make it anything but the unpalatable, whimsical self-indulgence that it is."
m/one_false_move," It's an eerie and horrifying experience, ably directed by newcomer Carl Franklin. It's also unsettlingly compelling, even at its most conventional moments."
m/one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest," Dealing with insanity, Cuckoo qualifies as an experience many will feel deeply and pass on to others."
m/one_for_the_money, Everything in One for the Money rings cringingly false.
m/one_from_the_heart, This has matured over the years into a very likeable and moving romance with much to recommend it.
m/one_good_cop," One Good Cop wanted to manipulate my emotions, and I was willing to let it try, but finally it was so shameless that I'd had enough."
m/one_hour_photo," Williams ... gives a performance that is riveting in its recessiveness and, as a consequence, truly, deeply scary."
m/one_last_night," An unnecessary (and honestly kind of creepy) mid-film plot twist kills the minimal momentum the film develops in its first half, making this picture feel like a rough assembly of not-quite-interesting-enough scenes."
m/one_lucky_elephant_2011," An often captivating documentary that will tug at your heartstrings, especially if you're an animal lover"
m/one_magic_christmas," '80s Christmas movie has depressing, intense scenes."
m/one_mans_hero," An earnest, flawed film for thoughtful, critical viewing."
m/one_missed_call," More useless than bad, the type of thing that will divert your attention for an hour and a half but nothing more."
m/one_missed_call_2003," A mainstream J-horror flick that dutifully regurgitates the apparitions, aesthetic, and themes of its genre predecessors."
m/one_more_time_2016," The characters are overburdened by backstories that constrict rather than inform their behavior, with Heard especially weighed down by Jude's flailing indecision."
m/one_october," Warm, lively and provocative. A must-see for New Yorkers, young and old."
m/one_of_us_2017, Reportedly no more than two percent of Hasidim leave the fold. This picture is an apt dissection of a few who wanted out and left.
m/one_small_hitch," Funny romcom has lots of sex, profanity, some drinking."
m/one_track_heart_the_story_of_krishna_das_2012," Modest and affecting, it's a portrait of the possibility of finding peace, contentment and self through both music and spirituality."
m/one_true_thing," In a time when most movie families are hopelessly dysfunctional, it is refreshing to see one that doesn't quite fit the mold."
m/one_week_and_a_day," Rambling in the best manner imaginable, it's an amusingly heartbreaking (and hopeful) portrait of misery's messiness."
m/ong_bak_3, The problems with Ong Bak 3 are palpable... It really feels like a Game of Death situation where they're building a movie around existing footage of the star.
m/ongbak, Who needs a budget when you can do what Tony Jaa can do?
m/only," Can't say [Takashi] Dosher is an accomplished filmmaker-yet, but this movie hits a nerve. Also, coming from a male director there is a misogynist undertone that just doesn't feel right."
m/only_angels_have_wings," One of the subline action movies of the era, with Grant in a John Wayne-like role, matched by Jean Arthur"
m/only_god_forgives_2013," Like 'Drive,' the soundtrack's character is the best performance in the film."
m/only_human," For all its boisterous chutzpah, there is little charm in this."
m/only_lovers_left_alive," The stakes may not be particularly high in Only Lovers Left Alive, but that's part of Jarmusch's point."
m/only_the_brave_2017," A gripping and powerfully emotional portrait of yee-haw heroism, pitting a squad of cocky, calendar-purty white dudes against an adversary with no creed or color, just an unquenchable appetite for destruction."
m/only_the_strong_survive," A human and warm film, in the vein of the mellow, though quite different, 'Jazz on a Summer's Day' and 'Round Midnight.'"
m/only_the_young," A sketchbook of a documentary filled with adolescent bodies groping, lurching and skateboarding toward burgeoning adulthood."
m/onward, Onward is a minor entry in the Pixar canon -- it's a perfectly pleasant way to pass the time but isn't nearly as meaningful as some of the studio's most accomplished work.
m/opal_dream, A touching Australian film about the healing and liberating powers of imagination and love in a besieged family and a divided mining community.
m/open_24_hours_2018," Open 24 Hours is a good, tense film that is well-written, well-acted, and done with a good attention to detail."
m/open_city," Remains a film of electric drama and high emotion, as well as a major turning point in film history."
m/open_grave," Individual moments linger, but the film is merely a rough draft of a thriller."
m/open_range, Affords the viewer a strong picture of the life of a 19th century cowpoke.
m/open_season," No classic but not a disaster...by comparison to the recent competition it hits the target, if not the bull's-eye."
m/open_water," A jittery, unapologetic experience worth a look for those who prefer psychological horror over broad slasher cliches."
m/open_water_2_adrift, An intense and engrossing but ultimately very flawed film that's just passable enough for one viewing...
m/open_water_3_cage_dive," With basically no association with Open Water 1-2 other than the ""stranded with sharks"" set-up, this sequel is so dreadful that it will have you rooting for the sharks."
m/open_windows_2013," With the film feeling so remarkably slapdash, it is a big step down Vigalondo's previous work, and a hugely disappointing English language debut."
m/open_your_eyes_1999, A film with enough intellectual meat on its stylish bones to give more adventurous moviegoers something to chew on afterward.
m/opening_night, Opening Night is a film so ambitious that it's hard to imagine anyone less accomplished and passionate than John Cassavetes even attempting it.
m/opera," An art film through and through, though it be an art film with an unusual number of bloody deaths... one of Argento's most memorable films."
m/operation_avalanche, Toronto writer-director-actor Matt Johnson's movie-within-a-movie record of the young agents' Cold War conspiracy adventures comes across more as a rambling lark than a tightly conceived film.
m/operation_chromite," Unrelenting from the offset, Operation Chromite offers a pure sense of entertainment, but lacks heavily on the emotional front, and that's not for the want of trying, as profundity is vied for, and yet is hard to adhere to."
m/operation_condor," If I were Pierce Brosnan, I'd be looking over my shoulder right about now."
m/operation_crossbow, The entire affair ends in a rousing burst of heroics gunfire and explosions. If the conclusion is inevitable it is none the less exciting.
m/operation_dumbo_drop," The story is so sentimentalized, so sanitized into a family comedy, that I do doubt the reality was anything like this."
m/operation_endgame, This terrifically populated but supremely dumb action comedy will be a hell of a lot of fun when you happen across it on late-night cable.
m/operation_finale, The drama benefits from a strong cast and can easily replace 1996's The Man Who Captured Eichmann as the go-to dramatization of this episode.
m/operation_mekong, A multi-nation task force wages war on a drug lord in this entertaining but overlong Hong Kong action film.
m/operation_petticoat, Hilarious for its oh-so-taboo treatment of things like underwear.
m/operation_red_sea," For all its unabashed jingoism (including a South China Sea warning towards the end), the hellish displays of combat it includes hardly make for an advertisement to enlist."
m/ophelia_2019," Most damning, however, is that the film no longer feels as if it belongs to Ophelia, but instead uses her for a different take on a well-known tale."
m/opposite_of_sex, Beyond the narration and the homosexual element... a fairly typical 1990s indie sex comedy
m/opposite_sex, An awful remake of George Cukor's witty 1939 The Women.
m/opposite_sex_and_how_to_live_with_them," Everything in this feebly written (by screenwriter Noah Stern), blandly staged (by director Matthew Meshekoff) film seems to have been recycled from some earlier movie or television show."
m/or," Consistently engaging, non-judgmental and cumulatively powerful two-hander marks a noteworthy feature debut for Israeli helmer Keren Yedaya."
m/orange_county," Jake Kasdan (son of Lawrence) directs Colin Hanks (son of Tom) in Orange County, a Wonder Boys for the teeny-bopper sect."
m/orange_sunshine_2016," Using still photos, modern-day talking heads and gorgeous re-enactments, the film is a jaw-dropping piece of social history. It's also a lot of fun, with some tears along the way. Did someone say 'trip'?"
m/oranges_and_sunshine," As you'd expect from a man named Loach, Jim refuses to dress up the facts with melodrama and even keeps his landscape shots grounded in the reality of the emotionally unfulfilled."
m/orca_the_killer_whale," Jaws may have had a profound effect at the beaches, sending vacationers out of the water in fear of their lives... but it had the opposite effect for the hack filmmakers of the world, sending them in to the water to make cheap knockoffs."
m/orchestra_of_exiles," Although the movie is overreliant on chintzy-looking and rather corny historical reenactments, these are counterbalanced by anecdote-rich interviews ..."
m/orchestra_rehearsal, ...a true Fellini film with humorous and thoughtful phrasing by an excellent ensemble cast of unknowns
m/ordinary_people, It is Redford's ability to let the movie breathe...that forces the viewer to experience the film on a visceral level.
m/ordinary_world_2016, Great concept. Cool casting. Mediocre (at best) execution.
m/orgasm_inc," Informative, amusing, expertly crafted and well-laureled."
m/orgazmo," Massively inventive and spiked with perversely wicked humor, ""Orgazmo"" is a delightful movie that showcases the multiple talents of Trey Parker as writer-director-star."
m/orhim_le_rega," Elya Inbar is a surprisingly commanding screen presence, but she's contending with a screenplay plagued by contrivance--a battle few could win."
m/original_kings_of_comedy," For about 3/4 of its length, The Original Kings of Comedy feels like the funniest movie of the year."
m/original_sin, [Cristofer] presents it like one of those late-night HBO softcore flicks that tries to be 'artistic' and fails miserably.
m/oritsu_uchugun_oneamisu_no_tsubasa," While there are but a few action sequences, they are spectacularly rendered and made doubly exciting due to the emotional involvement generated by the rest of the film."
m/orlando," The absurdity of the story bothered me. Not the fantasy premise of the deathless person moving through the ages or even the changing of sex, but for the idea that Orlando could have lived so long and apparently remained so vapid and lacking in insight."
m/ornette_made_in_america, Ornette: Made in America is a look at a groundbreaking artist by a groundbreaking artist.
m/orphans_of_the_storm, One of the best of the director's late silent epics.
m/orwell_rolls_in_his_grave, An incredible collection of documentation and first hand testimony as to what is happening to us behind our backs -- and under our noses.
m/osama," Billed as the first entirely Afghan film shot on home soil since the rise and fall of the Taliban, Siddiq Barmak's Osama ends up being of greater historical significance than of any lasting artistic merit."
m/oscar_and_lucinda," Oscar and Lucinda begins with the look of a period literary adaptation, but this is not Dickens, Austen, Forster or James; Carey's novel is playful and manipulative, and so is the film."
m/oslo_august_31st," The film is overlong, spinning its sequential disenchantments. But mood and place are believable."
m/osmosis_jones," If the Farrelly brothers taught Anatomy & Physiology in school, no one would cut ever class."
m/oss_117_lost_in_rio," Less raucous than CAIRO, NEST OF SPIES, this new adventure for the suave but bigoted French super-agent is still extremely good fun, with its amusing script, hilarious characters and astonishingly detailed production design."
m/osterman_weekend," The structure is a mess (the film was recut against Peckinpah's wishes), which ultimately makes it difficult to tell whether its oddly compelling qualities are the result of a coherent artistic strategy or the cynical carelessness of a director sidelined."
m/ot_our_town," Entertaining and heartening, OT is also an urgent reminder of the importance of arts-related programs in the schools, and could serve as a useful tool tool for those fighting the good fight for such funding."
m/other_boleyn_girl," Shot in high definition and filmed at many historic locations, the film somehow still lacks the splendor of an epic."
m/other_end_of_the_line," At a time when our global standing is sinking like a stone, it's comforting to know that, at least on the big screen, we can still land the babes no matter how obnoxious we are."
m/other_guys, Will Ferrell returns to form and Mark Wahlberg does his funniest work since 'The Happening' in this riotous buddy comedy.
m/other_peoples_money," Not bad, but the point is muddled in a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be."
m/other_sister," It's as dull as a butter knife and slowed to interminable mediocrity, and inadvertently brings to mind the title of Marshall's autobiography: ""Wake Me When It's Funny."""
m/otherhood," The three lead actresses also produced the film, presumably because there are not enough good roles for women over 35. They need to look a little harder."
m/ouija_2014, Man am I sick of seeing people getting dragged out of shot by invisible forces.
m/ouija_origin_of_evil," Compared to the first, it has a better sense of mood, expert shot placement and some actual jokes. You want to give it the benefit of the doubt; you also respect it enough to be honest and say it doesn't really work."
m/our_blood_is_wine," A slightly tipsy, thoroughly charming documentary about winemaking in post-Soviet Georgia."
m/our_brand_is_crisis, Our Brand is Crisis looks to remind well-meaning people like Carville and Rosner to put the humanity in brand marketing.
m/our_brand_is_crisis_2016, Can Sandra Bullock in top form overcome longtime American audience resistance to comedies about politics and maybe even get another nomination in the process?
m/our_children_2012," Underlying this bizarre domestic dynamic is a post-colonialist drama... but those four dead children might better have come unheralded, with Murielle a surprise Medea rather than a pre-destined anti-heroine enacting a mere fait accompli."
m/our_city_dreams," Clemente shows she knows a thing or two about filmmaking. As somebody once said: like father, like daughter."
m/our_evil, Our Evil is an interesting film and a bold attempt at doing something different. Galli will be one to watch.
m/our_family_wedding, Famuyiwa has made a mostly charming movie despite its cliche milieu.
m/our_hospitality," With Keaton's unique charm and a beautifully rendered sense of time and place, it becomes a showcase for one of cinema's great comic filmmakers."
m/our_house_2018," Our House thoughtfully examines how those traumas can affect the familial unit, and how the worst of circumstances can sometimes bring out the best in people, especially when their loved ones are in jeopardy."
m/our_idiot_brother, A fine addition to the dysfunctional family comedy genre.
m/our_kind_of_traitor_2016," The spycraft elements make for some nailbiting sequences... Despite an impressive cast on reliably good form, there's no one really to root for."
m/our_lady_of_the_assassins," Schroeder assays his subject rather than assails the viewer, delivering the city in creamy, beautifully fading browns."
m/our_little_sister," Kore-Eda's film is more than the beautifully luminous faces of his actresses, the particular way they move and speak, or the lovely landscapes of Kamakura, even though all of these should be admired."
m/our_man_flint," The plot is the usual hokum and Edward Mulhare isn't really eccentric enough to compete in the villainy stakes, but Coburn is plainly enjoying himself so much, and the trimmings are so stylish, that it's impossible not to enjoy."
m/our_man_in_tehran," Weinstein and Taylor keep things traditional when it comes to the [documentary] format, which lets viewers feel as though they're simply gathering 'round the fireplace for story time."
m/our_nixon, A collection of home movies so pathetic and shocking that the viewer cannot help but feel at least temporary sympathy for Richard M. Nixon.
m/our_song," It is hard to imagine a movie less self-indulgent than Our Song, or one more completely absorbed in the complex humanity of its subjects."
m/our_souls_at_night, A disappointingly subdued reunion for Fonda and Redford.
m/our_vinyl_weighs_a_ton_this_is_stones_throw_records_2013," It would be nicer to hear more about the business side of things, but the passion shown by the participants is infectious."
m/out_cold, Out Cold is destined to live on as a constant of late-night cable film.
m/out_for_justice, Out for Justice only real weakness is Seagal himself.
m/out_in_the_dark," Though it's rather clumsily scripted, formulaic in structure and sometimes contrived, Out In The Dark is strengthened by its subtext and elevated by tender, affecting performances from the leads."
m/out_of_africa," For all that it may come out of Africa, the film's final destination is not many miles from Disneyland."
m/out_of_blue," Morley sustains a vibe of low-key Lynchian weirdness throughout, enough to keep your mind from wandering even as the investigation meanders this way and that."
m/out_of_the_clear_blue_sky, A complex story is compellingly told in this powerful 9/11 documentary.
m/out_of_the_dark_2015, Julia Stiles and Scott Speedman sleepwalk through a thriller that never lets either of their talents materialize.
m/out_of_the_furnace," Loyalty and consequence collide in the ""Crazy Heart"" director's sophomore feature...but while those themes eventually result in payoffs that are noticeably muted and confused, the film is luckily powered by a powerful trio of performances at its core..."
m/out_of_the_past," Not just one fine noir film among many. It has been a guage for the genre, even a template, over the last 50 years."
m/out_of_time," Working from a tight script by first-time screenwriter Dave Collard, Franklin moves the story at a brisk pace as his often-in-motion camera captures the sultry sensuality of a backwater coastal town."
m/out_stealing_horses," A central message in Out Stealing Horses is how humans experience pain. The characters' choices and consequences are not judged but marked with kindness, creating a memorable, moving narrative."
m/outbreak, This is a picture good enough to make you want to go to the movies and frightening enough to make you wonder if you should avoid the crowds.
m/outcast," Thoroughly grim but original and commendable indie-Scot-horror about deadlocked necromancers, played by Kate Dickie and James Nesbitt."
m/outcast_2015," Given the state of Nicolas Cage's résumé, it's faint praise to say this samurai tale is slightly better than most of his recent movies."
m/outfoxed_rupert_murdochs_war_on_journalism," When those talking heads metamorphose into familiar ranting heads, it becomes another mesmerizing right-wing horror show."
m/outland, Outland works as a sturdy morality play set uin an unsual environment.
m/outlander, One of the more outlandish B-pictures to come out of the Great Movie Mash-up Machine known as The Weinstein Co.
m/outlaw, Crime-revenge-porn without any style or wit or convincing narrative.
m/outlaw_josey_wales, Eastwood is just one of several interesting and three-dimensional characters in a story that is as much about the shape of the country at the close of the Civil War as it is an action Western.
m/outlaw_king," Outlaw King is no Braveheart, but it's an engaging enough piece of swords & shields entertainment to add to your queue."
m/outlaws_2019," McCallum fashions an unremittingly vicious, leather-and-ink slugfest whose women are just as distasteful as its men."
m/outlaws_and_angels," Grindhouse-worthy blood gushes forth, but the big thing this film doesn't have in common with some of the great pulp classics is that it's ultimately boring."
m/outpost_black_sun, It plays out like a dull mission from a particularly naff first-person-shooter video game.
m/outrageous_fortune," Such rarefied screen writing calls for the peerless talents of Arthur Hiller, a director with the comic timing of a tax auditor."
m/outside_bet_2012," I wish it were better, but it's more hardtack than Seabiscuit."
m/outside_in_2018, This is a life study in which you watch to see whether these people can find their way in the world. You root for them. You care.
m/outside_providence, Hatosy oozes confidence and has undeniable screen charisma!
m/outsiders, ... like a Disney movie that might be titled 'Spin and Marty Get Serious'
m/outsourced," Fun as it is, the film's greatest failure is to present a catalogue of stereotypes on both sides of the India/America divide which feeds the farce ... but foils any notion of social commentary."
m/ovation, Plays like an actors' workshop exercise that doesn't know when to quit ...
m/over_the_edge," This genre has spawned more unmemorable films than quality ones; sadly, Over the Edge falls into the former category."
m/over_the_gw," Writer-director Nick Gaglia has fashioned a documentary-style drama that is too narratively disjointed to achieve maximum impact, but too emotionally potent in fits and starts to be dismissed out of hand."
m/over_the_hedge," A cute, clever little movie that gets on the screen, entertains, and then gets off."
m/over_the_top, ... a movie about arm-wrestling. What's next? Crab soccer?
m/overboard, Overboard is a dizzy comedy about the ways in which wealth insulates the rich from the simple pleasures of life.
m/overboard_2018," As different as it would like to declare itself to be because of the gender switch, there isn't much to the Overboard remake that warrants a second shot on the big screen."
m/overcomer, The story invites anyone who has experienced a season of failure or a season of loss to find something to keep them going. That thing is finding your faith
m/overdrive_2017," Overdrive provides just enough crash-and-burn stunt action to satisfy undemanding thrill-seekers, but not much else."
m/overlord," Combines its newsreel and fictional footage so effectively that it has a greater impact than all fiction, or all documentary, could have achieved."
m/overlord_2018," Overlord is a loud, intense, Nazi-punching good time."
m/overnight," The film's practical lesson is that you should steer clear of dogfights unless yours is the biggest, meanest dog in the game."
m/overnight-delivery," No shame needs to be attached to a public recounting of Overnight Delivery, a masters class entry in the comedic canon of fitfully mismatched twentysomething romances."
m/oxbow_incident," The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) is a grim, low-budget Western masterpiece from director William A. Wellman - based upon the famed novel by Walter Van Tilburg Clark of the same name. Produced and written for the screen by Lamar Trotti, this is an intense..."
m/oyster_farmer," This darkly humorous, sometimes even raunchy film mostly eludes a typical cutesy, feel-good formula."
m/oz_the_great_and_powerful," While Judy Garland sang ""Over the Rainbow"" this is Sam Raimi taking us to the dark side of the rainbow and parents be warned: your wee ones will get nightmares of the winged-baboon variety."
m/p2," Wes Bentley's screaming and ranting is (unintentionally) funny, not unnerving. It's like being menaced by Tobey Maguire."
m/pacific_rim_2013, Guillermo del Toro blows the likes of Battleship and Transformers out of the water with action sequences that are breathtaking in scope and ferocious in intensity.
m/pacific_rim_uprising," We're here for the robot v monster mayhem, and that's where Uprising delivers in broad cartoon strokes of wholesale destruction."
m/pacifier," A by-the-books Disney family film. If this is what you are looking for, Diesel delivers an easy, goodwill charm. The preview audience embraced it."
m/paddington_2," Paddington 2 won't save the world, sadly, but it's existence makes everything just that tiny bit better and more, well, bearable."
m/paddington_2014," Affectionately honoring the everyday quirks of Bond's stories, while subtly updating their middle-class London milieu, King's film may divide loyal Paddingtophiles with its high-stakes caper plot, but their enraptured kids won't care a whit."
m/paddleton," Thanks to two pitch-perfect performances, Paddleton is bittersweet and poignant beyond words."
m/padre_padrone," There are some strikingly beautiful images, all in context, as we touch themes of father-son conflict and coming of age drama"
m/page_one_inside_the_new_york_times," Ultimately, the otherwise likable 'Page One' only really fails in its attempt to say something."
m/page_turner, A tight little emotional thriller about a music lover who becomes a musician-hater.
m/pagemaster," This clever, often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination."
m/pahokee, The kids of Pahokee are so winning and the eye of directors Ivete Lucas and Patrick Bresnan are so attune to the consequential aspects of teen life that it leaves you with several takeaways worthy of your time.
m/paid_in_full," Performances are strong, especially that of Mr. Wood."
m/pain_and_gain," A reminder that while crime does not pay, it does sometimes serve as fodder for lurid headlines and hilarious hijinks."
m/pain_and_glory," All this adds a film at once honest and exhibitionist, but perfectly consistent with the creative moment Almodóvar lives today. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/paint_your_wagon," Logan's movie is a flop on many levels, a musical in which America's most macho actors, Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin, are miscast and required to sing."
m/painted_skin_the_resurrection," Blindingly gorgeous to look at and exceptionally well acted, at least by the women."
m/painted_veil," Lack[s] an essential, gripping spark of self-destructiveness and ardor."
m/pal_joey, The film goes up in flames when its '50s morality rears its ugly head.
m/pale_rider, Clint Eastwood stars as the mysterious stranger who arrives in a town and challenges the citizens to fight evil.
m/paleface," The plot is slender and silly, but Bob Hope and Jane Russell have some good moments in a comedy that was very popualar and led to an equally popular sequel."
m/pali_road_2016," Adding to the appeal is the ability of [director] Lim and cinematographer Quyen Tran to make the Hawaiian landscape seem both beautiful and threatening, an element rarely seen in Hollywood's picture-postcard portrayals of the islands."
m/palindromes," ...positive aspects are undermined by the bizarre rotating-actresses gimmick, which makes it impossible for the viewer to ever connect with [the central character]."
m/palio, Cosima Spender's documentary... plays like a classic sports drama thanks to its memorable central characters.
m/palm_beach_story," Sturges' dialogue, as always, is not only sharp, but cutting, delivered with typical flair by the charter members of Sturges' company of actors."
m/palmetto, Thematically-crippled. A half-hearted sultry gumshoe noir piece that will quickly fall by the wayside.
m/palo_alto," It'd be a mistake to be scared off by the subject matter, so often a vehicle for moralism: suburban teenagers hang out around town, go to parties, hook up, are annoying or sweet."
m/pan_2015," The actors all try hard to keep the energy up but never get convincingly in synch and, with the exception of Peter, the characters don't reasonably comport with one's pre-existing images of them."
m/pandemic_2016," Pandemic is a zombie movie whose greatest battle isn't with the undead, but a gimmicky directing style that constantly threatens to derail the mostly enjoyable experience."
m/pandora_and_the_flying_dutchman," In essaying a classic tragedy, Mr. Lewin has managed to fashion a long and fairly polished drama. But it is, after all, a saga that shines only fitfully."
m/pandoras_promise_2013, The pro-nuclear left grabs the bullhorn in this lively advocacy documentary.
m/pandorum," Take Ben Foster, have him walk slowly down a dark corridor and see something or someone in the distance, then either have him fall flat on his face, or get a butt-whippin'. Repeat approximately twenty times"
m/panic_in_the_streets," Still tense today, more than 60 years after it was made"
m/panic_in_year_zero, Intriguing low-budget opus that now seems like a time-capsule of nuclear paranoia
m/panic_room," In Fincher's hands, this rather obtuse premise (how can the audience relate?) not only actually works, it's frightening, interesting, and thrilling."
m/pans_labyrinth," In his highly atmospheric film, Del Toro also extracts some excellent performances, especially Lopez, who makes his character a monster with some human qualities, and Maribel Verdú as Ofelia's ailing mother."
m/papa_hemingway_in_cuba, Is it legal for a movie about Ernest Hemingway to have dialogue this bad?
m/papadopoulos_and_sons_2012, Some meaty themes and complex performances add badly needed weight to this somewhat simplistic British comedy-drama.
m/paparazzi, A stupid celebrity revenge film that should never have been made.
m/paper," It's a bit too busy and precocious for its own good, but still has enough of a charming throwback quality that I was willing to forgive many of its flaws."
m/paper_chase," It's intelligent, entertaining and ultimately uplifting, but never really gets to the heart of the class struggle (academic and social) that's taking place."
m/paper_heart," I don't think they ever get around to answering the question about true love, but it's fun to watch the process."
m/paper_moon, A cute little family drama about a young con artist and her father as they build a grifting empire.
m/paper_planes," An impressionable 12 year old ready to discover the world and a grieving father shutting it out are the key characters in this rousing and heartwarming family film in which winning, losing and family are everything"
m/paper_towns, The film rightly treads a neat middle ground between sentimental teen idealism and the indie cool of The OC.
m/paperclips," There is something quite heartening about watching these kids earnestly guide others around their memorial, which was four years in the making."
m/papillon, Classic grungy prison drama with great performances throughout.
m/papillon_2018," ... this brutal, bruising film never quite connects with its deeper themes, resulting in a story full of suffering but not enough transcendence."
m/paprika, The idea of cinema as irrepressible bogeyman might be Kon's own confession.
m/parade," A distillation not of Jacques Tati per se, but of communal spectacle, creativity and creation, simply -- hence, cinema."
m/paradise_2013, The movie fits around its heroine the way a shell fits its turtle-it's like she secreted it.
m/paradise_faith_2013, The Paradise trilogy does not have the extravagant power of a movie like Import/Export - but it is gaining in potency.
m/paradise_hills," A beautiful original dystopia, with something to say about the extent to which parents want their kids to conform."
m/paradise_lost_2_revelations, If this film is not as good as the first one ... it piles even more evidence up that says that three teenage boys were convicted of a crime they didn't commit.
m/paradise_lost_3_purgatory_2009," Beyond being an articulate examination of the case, the conclusion of the film will leave you with all kinds of questions to ponder about what justice in our legal system really means."
m/paradise_lost_child_murders_at_robin_hood_hills, The film creates a vivid portrait of a subculture in which Satan is a central figure.
m/paradise_love," It would be fitting with Seidl's apparent project if Paradise (Love) was, in some sense, a documentary of its own making. But that doesn't make its facile ironies about still-pervasive, post-colonial exploitation and dehumanization any more enlightening"
m/paradise_now," [It] lays out the issues in an accessible but rather too over-correct way, seemingly eager to please all parties at the expense of real passion."
m/paradise_road, A triumphant celebration of the human spirit in the face of suffering.
m/parallax_view," The thrills don't mount as the film goes on. They don't even accumulate. Once they are experienced, they dissolve so thoroughly that by the end you're likely to feel as cheated as I did."
m/paranoia_2013, A corporate thriller that offers juicy roles for Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. Not terribly original but entertaining.
m/paranoid_park, An original and even memorable addition to Van Sant's filmography.
m/paranormal_activity," Peli shows a talent for suspense and creating an atmosphere of dread, and Featherston and Sloat give effective (improvised?) performances."
m/paranormal_activity_2," If the added slickness and occasionally too-real-to-be-real acting takes one from the premise momentarily, the inherent creepiness and a half-dozen solid jump-in-your-seat moments bring audiences back with jarring effectiveness."
m/paranormal_activity_3," Paranormal Activity 3 earns points for its low-key ability to keep viewers primed over long stretches to expect that something very bad, or even worse, may happen at any moment."
m/paranormal_activity_4_2012," This entry in the series is the first time I've felt like they played it safe, and that's a shame."
m/paranormal_activity_the_ghost_dimension, These jump scares are so utterly predictable that they might as well be heralded on-screen with a bouncing ball and an appearance by the Oogieloves.
m/paranormal_activity_the_marked_ones, It's nothing short of an absolute gift to the passionate fans of this storied franchise. The Marked Ones proves without a shadow of a doubt that Paranormal Activity is back in top form... with a wicked and evil vengeance.
m/paranorman," Few movies so taken with death have felt so rudely alive as ParaNorman, the latest handcrafted marvel from the stop-motion artists at Laika."
m/parasite_1982," Parasite is lethargic between its terror scenes, making it a test of patience for all but the fanatical followers of horror cheapies."
m/parasite_2019," Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: ""Parasite"" is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage."
m/parched," You can see flashes of bawdy comedic brilliance sprinkled throughout Parched, an otherwise grim Indian drama about four women living in a male-dominated village."
m/parental_guidance_2012," Thanks to a wonderful cast and Crystal's good intentions, Parental Guidance is a much better movie than one might expect it to be."
m/parenthood," Director Ron Howard combines this multi-generational suburban soap almost effortlessly, considering the number of parents or would be parents we're expected to care about."
m/parents," The Oedipal conflict that Parents plays out is timeless, but also very much rooted in its times, with a darkly comic nostalgia that looks both backwards to a Paradise lost and forwards to one perhaps never regained."
m/pariah_2011," Vivid photography, true-to-life moments and a wonderful lead performance compensate for some first-timer missteps in debutante writer-director Dee Rees' Pariah."
m/pariah_dog," Beautifully shot, largely at night under the velvety glow of street lights, this is a dreamlike portrait of the city of Kolkata. And everywhere there are stray dogs, estimated at more than 80,000"
m/paris_36," Beautifully realised homage to 30s theatre and French cinema, this is thoroughly charming and entertaining throughout."
m/paris_belongs_to_us," Rivette was perhaps more of a prognosticator than he realized, anticipating the downfall of the very movement he was involved in before it had effectively begun."
m/paris_can_wait, The pointless story of a pair of privileged white people enjoying a series of lavish meals and pricey hotels is cringe-worthy in its casual and tone-deaf elitism.
m/paris_is_burning," [Paris Is Burning] is a joyous anthem of alternative lifestyles -- but more than that, it's a subtle, scathing, unforgettable indictment of the Reagan '80s and our '90s."
m/paris_je_taime," Eighteen short stories in 120 minutes is almost too much to take but this film seems to bind them all together, somehow, with love."
m/paris_manhattan," The premise might be slight, but there's a sprinkling of magic in Lellouche's debut feature about a young woman obsessed by Woody Allen, as she traverses the bridges of her life, searching for the elusive pathway to happiness"
m/paris_texas," Wenders' slow, moody style isn't for everyone, but this is the epitome of it"
m/parker_2012, A little more effort -- from anyone -- might be nice.
m/parkland," The film is otherwise engrossing, quietly revelatory, and often profoundly moving as it retells a story we only thought we knew."
m/particle_fever, A timely and fascinating look at physicists' search for the Higgs boson.
m/partir, The performances and Agnes Godard's cinematography ensure that this is a very elegant piece of trash.
m/partisan," An intriguing, carefully crafted film with an obnoxious tendency to meditate when you wish it would elaborate. It feels like an objectively ""good film"" that wouldn't be anyone's favorite."
m/party_monster," A colorful, lurid and ultimately so-what look at some rather obnoxious personalities careening down their little road to ruin."
m/pass_over," Lee's certainly been a part of this dialogue for a long time, and it's thrilling to see him hook into turbulent material from a talented young writer eager to throw some dramatic haymakers of her own."
m/passage_to_india, A literary riddle that every viewer is challenged to decipher in light of his or her own perception of human passion and prejudice.
m/passage_to_mars," Take ""Ice Road Truckers,"" mix it with ""The Martian"" and blend in a book of verse, and you've got something that resembles ""Passage to Mars,"" a beguiling documentary that's concerned as much with images as it is with information."
m/passenger-side, Bissonnette sidesteps the pitfalls of the indie road movie in some style.
m/passenger_57," If cheesy dialogue and bad action are your cup of tea, then go to, go to."
m/passengers_2016," ""If you aren't nauseated by the ethics, it's quite engaging."""
m/passion_2013," Precise in its aesthetics, it's an excellent late-period work that shows, without being over-bearing, how the ascent of the corporate ladder can sometimes be a descent into a deeper circle of hell."
m/passion_in_the_desert," Part an adventurous love story between a man and a leopard, part a metaphysical meditation about the mysteries of Nature, Lavinia Currier's feature directorial debut is dramatically inert but visually striking."
m/passion_of_darkly_noon," An off-beat, haunting, overwrought fairy tale for adults."
m/passion_of_joan_of_arc, Perhaps one of the most intricate and powerful achievements of the silent era.
m/passion_of_mind," More likely to leave viewers emotionally exhausted and squirming in their seats, mumbling something like, 'Oh, c'mon-give me a break!'"
m/passion_of_the_christ," There's no doubt that Jim Caviezel was put through the wringer here, and he gives a spiritual performance that's offset by the physical ordeal he had to endure during the torture scenes and the crucifixion."
m/passion_play, It's embarrassing for the stars because they try to take such putrid material seriously.
m/passionada," An engaging and similarly well conceived, directed and acted romantic drama."
m/passione," [VIDEO] If you want passion, ""Passione"" has plenty to share."
m/pat_and_mike," The film doesn't have much plot but the dialogue is bright, and the roles tailor-made for stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn demonstrates with physical strength what she proved in Adam's Rib with intellect, that women can be equal to men"
m/pat_garrett_and_billy_the_kid, The mushy pretensions of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid suggest either that [Peckinpah] has begun to take talk about his genius too seriously (it can happen to the best) or that he has fallen in with bad company.
m/patagonia_rising_2011, Elicits the combination of rage and helplessness (and guilty wanderlust) unique to the genre with admirable thoroughness and balance.
m/patch_adams," Here is the year's least welcome technological advance, the computer-generated butterfly meant to provide a touch of magic for a film that has none of its own."
m/patema_inverted, Impressive but not dazzling. Miyazaki would have given the action more thump and Kon might have gone that bit weirder.
m/paterno_2018," Paterno's most grimly compelling through line [is in] the ways in which the Paternos, Penn State officials, the campus, the community, the media, the culture at large wall themselves off from -- blind themselves to --the reality of the situation."
m/paterson, Jim Jarmusch's sumptuous sonnet to poetry and ordinariness.
m/path_to_war," From whatever angle you approach it, though, ""Path to War"" is a tremendous achievement -- not as a history lesson but as a profoundly emotional experience."
m/pather_panchali, An understated masterpiece in simplicity and poetical mood.
m/pathfinder," Heroic Fantasy of the first order, from filmmakers who obviously studied the paintings of Frank Frazetta and the writings of Robert E. Howard."
m/paths_of_glory," Dealing with the politics and business of combat, Kubrick's fact-inspired tale is one of the most powerful, cynical, and probing anti-war films ever made, including the 1930 Oscar winnere All Quiet on the Western Front."
m/patience_2011," Retraces Sebald's steps, reuniting the novel's descriptions of actual places and spaces with their images and weaving in illuminating commentary from admirers (Rick Moody, Robert McFarlane)."
m/patrick_2019," The entire thing is so relentlessly bright and breezy that, much like the scrunchy-faced pooch himself, it eventually wins you over, even if it never quite delivers the promised laughs."
m/patrick_evil_awakens, Takes the coolest parts of the original Aussie thriller and adds some more goofy fun.
m/patriocracy," To presume that even an explicitly neutral political position lacks its own subjective ideological bias is nothing more than a delusion, and not a particularly useful one."
m/patriot_games, I expected this one to be a little more cerebral and without the Indiana Jones ending.
m/patriots_day_2016," An intense, jittery re-creation of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the four-day manhunt that followed, ""Patriots Day"" is the movie CBS Films was put on this earth to produce."
m/patton," Well done, but I can't get around a sense of glorifying war"
m/patton_oswalt_annihilation," Annihilation isn't a call for sympathy, it's a plea for empathy."
m/patton_oswalt_finest_hour," Finest Hour shows the comic at the top of his game, equal in humor, energy and originality to the best of his peers."
m/patton_oswalt_talking_for_clapping, Oswalt knows how good he is at his job. Good enough to thread bits of sociopolitical commentary in among other material about his failings as the man of the house and a pitch perfect closer that tells of the worst birthday clown of all time.
m/patton_oswalt_tragedy_+_comedy_equals_time," While Tragedy Plus Comedy Equals Time might not be a watershed hour of stand-up -- one that doesn't challenge audiences, break taboos or illuminate ordinary things in a new light -- ""Dad"" Patton is a decent guy to spend an hour with."
m/paul," Though it's not on a par with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's best work, it's hard to imagine anybody not enjoying it."
m/paul_apostle_of_christ," The film's simple, redundant, but valuable moral lesson to its audience finds comfortable enough expression in an aesthetic that's banal but impressively consistent."
m/paul_blart_mall_cop," Like the movie's sad-sack hero, this comedy never comes close to achieving its real potential."
m/paul_blart_mall_cop_2, It's better than some of the other titles in the Kevin James back catalogue ... but that's like saying one bout of syphilis was better than another bout of syphilis.
m/paul_goodman_changed_my_life_2011," I sometimes feel like I like the idea of Paul Goodman more than the reality of most of his writing, but it is this cheering idea of him as utopian sexual and societal prophet that Lee's film brings back most seductively."
m/paul_williams_still_alive_2011," A fascinating, penetrating look at a former celebrity who found his true self after crashing and burning."
m/paulie," A convenient, unprepossessing time-waster for Saturday afternoon kiddies."
m/pauline_at_the_beach," One of those small, deliberately paced, but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise, but a lot happens to the characters emotionally."
m/pauly_shore_is_dead," A delightful surprise that'll raise as many questions as it does bust guts.A very funny, blatantly satirical and insolently honest look into the life of the former it boy"
m/pavarotti," Maybe ""Pavarotti"" would be even more compelling if Howard had delved deeper into the contradictions and controversies. But the director does achieve the first goal on entertainment: Always leave them wanting more."
m/pawn_sacrifice," ""Pawn Sacrifice"" whips up a dervish of energy and is mostly engaging, yet the movie isn't a definitive checkmate. The narrative ferocity is unable, try as it might, to smooth over some of the bumps in the story and gaps in the plotting."
m/pay_it_forward," As it stands now, Pay It Forward winds up making a very good case for never going out of your way to help anybody."
m/payback_2012, A rarefied conceptual docu that will appeal to a limited but highly appreciative audience.
m/paycheck, Is Affleck in it for the salvation of the world or Uma Thurman's booty?
m/peace_love_and_misunderstanding, Story of a mother-daughter reunion and its transformative impact on both women; another triumph from veteran Australian director Bruce Beresford.
m/peaceful_warrior, So under the spell of the be-here-now philosophy of Dan Millman's New Age-y memoir from which it was drawn that it loses sight of the need to credibly dramatize the ideas.
m/pearl_2020," Pearl makes no attempt at what could have been an emotional, albeit predictable drama leaving it feeling uninspired."
m/pearl_jam_twenty," Any enterprise like this is inherently self-congratulatory, but the film is best considered from Crowe's perspective: that of a fan."
m/pecker," ...mostly potshots, lightly diverting goofiness with a too-pat happy ending."
m/peep-world, The fine cast tries in vain to elicit empathy for characters that are defined by their individual failures and nothing more.
m/peeping_tom_1960," A remarkable examination of the psychology of filmmaking and film viewing, and one of the most disturbing films ever made."
m/peeples," Tina Gordon Chism's film collapses into a series of clumsy improvisatory sketches, tied up in cheap, risibly sentimental catharsis."
m/peepli-live," Peepli Live forgets to ""consider the person"" in whom it's allegedly interested."
m/peewees_big_adventure, Herman is trying to turn attitudinizing into comic performance art. But in this case he hasn't developed his stand-up posture into a fleshed-out character.
m/peggy_sue_got_married," Miss Turner's self-assured comic timing goes a long way toward salvaging the film, providing both moral and physical dimension to a role that scarcely exists."
m/pele_birth_of_a_legend_2016," The beautiful game, as Pelé called football (or soccer to us Americans), has never felt like such a sedate slog."
m/pelican_brief," An old hand at this sort of thing, Pakula goes through the motions, but not much more."
m/pelican_dreams, It is not as focused as WILD PARROTS and it certainly is not one of the technological wonders that cutting edge nature films have become.
m/pelle_the_conqueror," The film is a towering achievement, grueling in its portrayal of a harsh existence yet ultimately an exhilarating experience unlikely to be forgotten."
m/penalty, The reason the film still works instead of surviving merely as a somewhat hysterical anti-communist message film is Lon Chaney's performance.
m/penance," Consumed in one gigantic, four-and-a-half-hour gulp, it becomes painfully repetitive and monotonous."
m/penelope2008," ""Penelope"" is a new twist on an old fairy tale template that succeeds for the heartfelt performances of Ricci and James McAvoy."
m/penguins_of_madagascar," Passable entertainment if you're 7. Otherwise, frenzied and aimless."
m/people_i_know, [O]ne of the most scathing looks at the PR business since Sweet Smell of Success.
m/people_like_us_2012, Genuine emotions barely win out over soapy complications in People Like Us.
m/people_places_things," For a film with one eye on messy, real emotions, ""People, Places, Things"" undercuts itself with goofy humor."
m/people_under_the_stairs," Craven toils under the influence of Lynch and Raimi, but below the surface hyperactivity the results are the same."
m/people_vs_larry_flynt," You may have never thought about someone like Flynt being the guardian of your liberty, but in Harrelson's sympathetic portrayal of Flynt, he makes a compelling and cogent case."
m/people_will_talk, People Will Talk had the nerve to present two such conventional box-office stars as Cary Grant and Jeanne Crain in a highly unconventional story which the bankers who underwrite Hollywood would never have sanctioned a few years ago.
m/peoples_republic_of_desire," Wu's fascinating, deeply alarming film ushers us into a bold new world where our pleasure is simulated, but our pain is real."
m/pepe_le_moko_1937, A milestone of prewar French cinema and fun picture under any circumstances.
m/pepi-luci-bom-y-otras-chicas-del-monton-pepi-luci-bom-and-other-girls-like-mom," A series of screen provocations, including frank and degrading sexual acts, it's designed primarily to jolt the viewer."
m/peppermint_2018, Chad St. John's screenplay fails because the setup is too distressing and depressing to wring enjoyment out of Garner's righteous vengeance.
m/peppermint_soda," Kurys, at the time a disillusioned actress-writer who reportedly had never held any kind of camera before, showed a remarkable assurance visually and rhythmically when mixing the serious with the playful."
m/percy_jackson_sea_of_monsters, It has a matinee gusto which may satisfy young teens.
m/perestroika," Perestroika asks, with a philosophical shrug of the shoulders: Why not try to be optimistic?"
m/perez_family, Sensuous and lush with a hint of Allende's magical realism in the bleeding of a man's broken heart and a string of rose petals trailing a line along the belly of a new lover.
m/perfect," If you're curious about why the gifted Tavolta's film career stalled in the mid-80s, 'Perfect' is the perfect explanation."
m/perfect_2019," There's a lack of control and specificity in their themes and how they play out, so it's never quite clear why the filmmakers are telling this story and what they're trying to get across."
m/perfect_blue_1999," Satoshi Kon has created a taut, tense thriller that's a lot more coherent than many sci-fi animes, and deftly weaves several levels of reality up until the twist ending."
m/perfect_man, So imperfect that it may qualify as one of the summer's worst movies.
m/perfect_score, It's Ocean's Eleven for people who can't count past six.
m/perfect_sense, a study of increasing depravity through a pair of lovers who adaptively appreciate each other the best they can as the world erodes around them.
m/perfect_sisters," A marginal film elevated, however inadvertently, by the strange specificity of its scenes"
m/perfect_sleep," The well-chosen supporting cast also deliver with especially sharp turns from Sanchez, Bauchau and Amendola who act this script as if it were Shakespeare."
m/perfect_storm, There's just not quite enough before the showpiece to make it memorable as a whole.
m/perfect_world," Within its narrow, unambitious, commercial boundaries, the movie is highly watchable."
m/performance, Roeg's debut as a director is a virtuoso juggling act which manipulates its visual and verbal imagery so cunningly that the borderline between reality and fantasy is gradually eliminated.
m/perfume_the_story_of_a_murderer, Flat out the most exciting cinematic adaptation of a novel since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.
m/period_end_of_sentence," Period. End of Sentence. may be a fairly flimsy documentary that never lives up to that puntastic title, but what it does do is serve as a necessary conversation starter."
m/permanent," Mild language, absurd violence in coming-of-age comedy."
m/permanent_midnight," It's horrifying (and R-rated) if not utterly relentless; it sucks your breath away, perhaps too much."
m/permanent_record," The implacable earnestness laid on by the script, which it took three people to put together, is not relieved by the nonstop songs, from rock-and-roll to Gilbert and Sullivan."
m/perriers_bounty," It's about as exciting as a two-part, coconut-flavoured snack chased down with a mouthful of mineral water."
m/persecuted," Straw-man cinema doesn't get much more ludicrous than this heavy-handed, Christian-themed minister-on-the-run thriller."
m/persepolis," A fresh, moving, out-of-the-gate masterpiece -- a work of animation that manages to be artistically brilliant, politically rich, morally engaging and emotionally overwhelming."
m/person_to_person_2017, Once you settle into its groove the movie becomes much more than the sum of its parts.
m/persona," A film we return to over the years, for the beauty of its images and because we hope to understand its mysteries."
m/personal_best," One of the best movies ever about competition, with wonderfully natural performances."
m/personal_velocity_three_portraits," In this involving film of three decidedly different women, filmmaker Rebecca Miller has distilled some gripping character portraits."
m/pest, Essentially a collection of ethnic and bodily function jokes punctuated by chases.
m/pet_2016," The films zigs where you expect a depraved zag, resulting in a smart and unsettling tale ..."
m/pet_sematary, Fairly effective adaptation of the Stephen King thriller.
m/pet_sematary_2019," Scary as hell, beautifully shot, and faithful in tone, horror fans won't want to miss this!"
m/pet_sematary_ii," Caso o roteirista deste filme morra, por favor, não o enterre no cemitério indígena visto na história."
m/pete_davidson_alive_from_new_york," Alive from New York, is a deflating slog of a special that Davidson seems to know isn't much good, and to which the tentative audience isn't quite sure how to react."
m/pete_seeger_the_power_of_song," The filmmakers treat this aged curmudgeon almost too reverently, but it is hard not to be awed by this gentle, resolute soul because of the ideas he steadfastly and faithfully represented."
m/peter_and_vandy, An enticing romantic drama with an assured and sexy performance by Jess Weixler.
m/peter_rabbit_2018," Suffering under a tirelessly ""hip"" script by Gluck and Rob Lieber, not to mention James Corden's typical desperation to please in the title role, poor Peter is only slightly less appealing than The Simpsons' focus-grouped pup Poochie."
m/peters_friends," Although it addresses AIDS more directly than many films have, it remains a lightweight entertainment, enjoyable mostly for the fun of hearing arch, skillful actors deliver droll remarks."
m/petes_dragon," Average Disney, a disappointment if you expect another 'Mary Poppins.'"
m/petes_dragon_2016," Technically smart and emotionally intelligent, with this endearing bauble of a film containing a big beating heart inside."
m/petits_freres, Doillon's ease with young performers is again seamlessly evident.
m/petulia, Curious one-shot US film in the midst of Lester's British period
m/petunia_2012," With honesty, conviction, humor, and insight, Christian and his cast and crew have created what is easily one of summer 2013's best films."
m/peyton_place," Effective melodrama with some satisfying emotional confrontations, particularly from Lana Turner."
m/phantasm, This is one movie with a cult following that I'd be embarrassed to be a part of.
m/phantasm_ii, A silly piece of gross-out joy from the imaginitive Don Coscarelli.
m/phantasm_lord_of_the_dead, Don Coscarelli outdoes the humor of John Hughes in what feels like a more honest version of the gleeful sadism in Home Alone.
m/phantasm_oblivion," [Brings] back the surrealistic creepiness of the original film, and then some."
m/phantasm_ravager," Phantasm: Ravager is not the place to start with the series (noobs beware), but it's a helluva way to end it."
m/phantom_2013, Here's the big ugly secret about Phantom. It's good.
m/phantom_of_the_opera, Evokes the original show while working as a movie in its own right.
m/phantom_of_the_opera_1943," If you liked the stage version, you'll LOVE this version."
m/phantom_of_the_paradise," Filled with bizarre colors, vintage 70s-era rock and truly imaginative ideas, it's still a thrill."
m/phantom_thread," ""Phantom Thread"" is seductive and absorbing, but it's also emotionally remote."
m/phantoms," The more the story and film unfold, the stupider ""Phantoms"" gets..."
m/phase_7_2011," Gore enthusiasts will find the body count acceptable, others may find the splatter a bit crude."
m/phase_iv_1974, Bass is the man who gave you the cat crawl for Walk on the Wild Side. As a director he's still got a lot of bugs to iron out.
m/phat_girlz," First time writer/director Nnegest Likke has her heart in the right place, but the intensity of her inexperience blinds every scene."
m/phenomena," The best acting is by an expressive, resourceful chimpanzee -- definitely the year's Best Supporting Primate."
m/phenomenon," A slight but agreeable blend of comedy, drama, and whimsy."
m/phil, It's so off-putting that the script's ability to subvert expectations at the eleventh hour falls flat.
m/phil-the-alien, This low-budget Canadian comedy rocks the house like few others.
m/phil_ochs_there_but_for_fortune, A well constructed doc about the prolific composer of protest songs bogs down with the usual archival backdrop.
m/phil_spector," Doesn't display any dramatic direction, but it has thespian verve and more than a few great scenes to help digest any inconsistencies and interruptions Mamet refuses to iron out."
m/philadelphia, Excellent performances and the sensitive handling of complicated issues.
m/philadelphia_story," I don't think anyone really cares about the fact that this was intended to be a cunning class satire with a capital C, but it's got big stars, they say cool things, they look good, it's funny, and the right guy gets the right girl in amusing fashion."
m/philip_roth_unmasked," The history of the man who gave the literary world such alternately acclaimed and vilified works as Portnoy's Complaint,Sabbath's Theater and I Married a Communist is continuously glossed over."
m/philomena," Stephen Frears returns to top form in a touching, at times funny true story of grave injustice and a mother's search for closure."
m/philophobia_or_the_fear_of_falling_in_love, Tyler Cole's debut feature is unlike any breakup movie before it.
m/phineas_and_ferb_the_movie_across_the_2nd_dimension," It's not an easy task to craft a movie that's appealing to families across the board, but the writers of this epic comic adventure have managed to do just that."
m/phoenix_2015, An ingeniously plotted and rather heartbreaking movie ...
m/phoenix_forgotten," Phoenix Forgotten is the perfect Friday night escape, a movie that succeeds without the pressures of landing a shocking twist or impressing with gross out gore."
m/phone_booth, The stratagems that compel the film to stay put are as improbable as they are illogical.
m/photographing_fairies," Those who consider themselves to be seekers of the truth, unafraid of trying new methods to reach the truth, should find this film intriguing."
m/phyllis_and_harold_2008," There's a secret busting out of Cindy Kleine's documentary about her parents' long and -- depending on whom she talks to -- unhappy marriage, but it's a pretty banal one."
m/physical_evidence, ...what on earth was [Michael Crichton] thinking when he agreed to helm this mess?
m/pi," ...an opiate-induced, caffeinated, super-octane trip."
m/pianist," During its last hour, The Pianist achieves something that approaches near transcendence."
m/piano," Despite elements that I found invigorating, most of the film left me cold."
m/piano_teacher," Overall, the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek's novel by some way. It settles for being merely grim."
m/picasso-and-braque-go-to-the-movies," Much of the documentary is a jumble of people extemporizing about this and that, but there is no connective overview."
m/pick_of_the_litter, Nachman and Hardy have produced another winning and relatable doc combining emotive storytelling with concisely focused filmmaking that's sure to charm viewers well beyond a sizable audience of dog lovers.
m/pickpocket_1959, Every image in Pickpocket evokes the director's idea of the soul in transition.
m/picnic_at_hanging_rock," The film works at various levels and certainly sparks discussion, as people attempt to figure out what they've just seen."
m/picture-me-a-models-diary, A terrific behind the scenes look at the not too glamorous world of runway models made by an uncommonly perceptive model and her filmmaker boyfriend.
m/picture_day, ...a well-intentioned yet wholly misguided coming-of-age story.
m/pieces, Terrible movie. And a definite must-see. Plus the DVD is surprisingly rich and moist.
m/pieces_of_april, It's juiced with recognizable family trauma and garnished with a quirky sensibility -- it's the portrait of a group of people we come to care about.
m/pied_piper, This is an extremely nasty critique of modern society masquerading as a candy-colored kiddie flick.
m/piercing," After a briefly discombobulating fake-out twist, Piercing can't seem to figure out how to advance or complicate its sick-joke premise."
m/pierrepoint_the_last_hangman, ...there's little doubt that the film will work just as well on the small screen as it does in theaters.
m/pierrot-le-fou-pierrot-goes-wild-crazy-pete," I once wrote of it as ""Godard's most virtuoso display of his mastery of Hollywood genres,"" I now see it more as the story of silly characters who have seen too many Hollywood movies."
m/pieta_2013," Frgil como manifestao poltica, mas suficientemente eficiente como drama para impressionar o espectador."
m/piglets_big_movie," While nowhere near as captivating as ABC's ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,"" this is a pleasant enough family diversion."
m/pilgrim_song, Tedium on the Trail could be the alternative title for this logy trek through the woods.
m/pilgrimage_2017, Brendan Muldowney's Pilgrimage is a sturdy piece of sophisticated hokum.
m/pillow_talk," Compulsively mainstream as only 50s Hollywood could be, and never very funny."
m/pimp_2010," With nil insight - into the sex industry or anything else - you might conclude Pimp is a film for men who get their kicks watching Dyer strut around leering at topless women who -- in the parlance of the film -- look like ""the basic pleasure model""."
m/pimp_2018, The strongest element of all is Palmer's thoroughly gripping performance.
m/pin_cushion," At its core, this is a story about bullying and mental illness and being disconnected from reality."
m/pina_3d," It's a surprise to see Wim Wenders embracing 3D in its full, feature-length glory but the medium works well to capture the graceful swirl of the German choreographer's work."
m/pineapple_express," Pineapple Express draws on stylistic and plot elements from '70s martial arts movies, shock horror films, and Tarantino set pieces to generate a new type of irreverent comic cinema in touch with the candid loyalty of a new generation."
m/pinero," Pinero's life may move by quickly here, but Bratt does a masterful job of finding the flow in this shooting star who burned bright and burned out too soon."
m/ping_pong_2012," It's breezy fun, touching lightly on illness and worse."
m/ping_pong_playa," could be a big, watchable cable TV star, especially if you're 12 years old."
m/ping_pong_summer," Ping Pong Summer may well feel rather familiar, but there is a lot of good-natured and very accessible fun to be had about its tale of one 13-year-old's dream of glory on the table tennis table."
m/pink_cadillac," An overlong, undercooked action comedy made out of retooled parts from other film vehicles."
m/pink_panther," Even with the inspired choice of Steve Martin in the Clouseau role, this Panther picture is more bumbling and fumbling than the blissfully oblivious, accident-prone Inspector."
m/pink_panther_2," Apparently Martin and Zwart really did want to make a movie this aimless and derivative, aware that their target audience of children won't know what they're missing."
m/pink_ribbons_inc, An alarming look at the profitable industry that has grown up around nonprofit fund raising for breast cancer research. Must see!
m/pinky, This is a groundbreaking film despite its absurdly stiff way at looking at how blacks and whites interact.
m/pinocchio_1940," A marvel and a joy to behold, it's the real thing. It's the stuff that dreams -- and nightmares -- are made of."
m/pioneer_2013, Pioneer features underwater sequences so breathless they'll thrill even James Cameron (director Erik Skjoldbjrg made the original Insomnia) but Petter's truth-chasing is at times too frantic and melodramatic.
m/pipe_dream, Funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness.
m/piranha_2_the_spawning, The special effects are awful (the piranhas are obviously hand puppets) and the script worse.
m/piranha_3d, A bloody entertaining blast of a flesh-eating fish-out-of-water story.
m/piranha_3dd," A virtual object lesson in the law of diminishing returns, director John Gulager displaying little of his predecessor Alexandre Aja's flair for juggling gory mayhem with sophomoric silliness."
m/piranhas, This tale of teenage gangs is badly in need of stronger visuals and pacing.
m/pirate," ...it does a lot better with its singing, dancing, and staging than it does with its acting, characterizations, and storytelling."
m/pirate_radio," Having lived in London when the pirate radio stations flourished in the 60s, I can easily relate to the subject matter, although the treatment is fanciful. But that's OK, we're talking about rock n'roll, sex and youth, and about having fun."
m/pirates_of_silicon_valley," If you ever wanted to know how the juggernaut grew, then go ahead and Netflix it."
m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_3," Yep, it's a bit too long and more than a little convoluted. It's still one of the best times I've had at the movies this year."
m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_mans_chest," Pirates of the Caribbean returns to theaters for more summer swashbuckling, only they may have forgotten to buckle their swash."
m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_dead_men_tell_no_tales," The most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it's less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments."
m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_on_stranger_tides," It's a succession of ever-escalating action sequences and grand settings. At first they're stunning, then they're routine, then they're wearying."
m/pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl," A giddily goofy bit of old-fashioned nonsense, a swashbuckler with supernatural overtones and a jolly sense of fun that keeps it surprisingly light on its feet."
m/pirates_who_dont_do_anything_a_veggietales_movie, Is it a coincidence or an animator's inside joke that the veggies' innocent smiles of joy look exactly like Cartman's when he enters a room of Cheesy Poofs?
m/pitch_black," Barely intermittent, reminding us that the B-movie is still very much with us."
m/pitch_perfect, The combination of inventive musical numbers and winning characters makes Pitch Perfect a pleasant surprise.
m/pitch_perfect_2," ...sticks pretty close to the formula of its predecessor, but it's saved by its sly humour, with digs flying thick and fast."
m/pitch_perfect_3," The Bellas become action stars (of sorts) in a sequel that fails to hit the high notes of the first movie, but which nonetheless delivers laughs."
m/pixels, Chris Columbus delivers a movie made for kids and adults alike. [Full review in Spanish]
m/place_in_the_sun," Hopelessly inadequate as a reading of Dreiser's great novel, and as usual Stevens seems too preoccupied with the story's monumentality to have much curiosity about its characters."
m/places_in_the_heart," Places definitely feels manipulative and sometimes even shameless, but cheap isn't a word that applies here."
m/plagues_and_pleasures_on_the_salton_sea," It's a human freak show of sorts, but Metzler and Springer never expose these folks in a way that derides their way of life, but rather let's us admire their unbroken, adventurous spirit."
m/plan-9-from-outer-space," Unintentionally one of the funniest movies ever made and actually worth the rental price for sheer, silly fun. Pay special attention to the less than authentic gravestones."
m/planeat, Possibly it ought to come with a warning: contains traces of smugness.
m/planes," Little ones will love the bright action scenes, but the lack of wit and humanity that makes exec producer John Lasseter's best work so special will leave grown-ups feeling frustratingly grounded."
m/planes_fire_and_rescue, Fire and Rescue isn't the kind of terrible film that makes viewers snap at each other over coffee afterward: It doesn't make a strong enough impression.
m/planes_trains_and_automobiles," As recent variations of an age-old movie genre go, it is fairly good, but somehow you hope for more from Steve Martin and John Candy."
m/planet_51, A playful throwback to the days when cartoons were mostly aimed at children.
m/planet_bboy," ""Planet B-Boy"" takes a step toward bringing together foreign communities by sharing a communal model of freedom of expression--the freedom of movement."
m/planet_of_snail_2012, This is a unique love story with a universal resonance.
m/planet_of_the_vampires," an interesting, if not entirely successful, attempt at genre blending"
m/planet_terror, Proud of and forward about its largely superficial fun.
m/plastic-planet," Boote's strong film will make you look at the floating plastic bag from American Beauty in a new, wholly suspicious way."
m/plastic_2014, Where do you start with a film as spectacularly awful as Plastic?
m/platoon, Platoon is like the Wall -- a dark and unforgettable memorial to the dead of Vietnam and an awesome requiem to the eternity of war.
m/play_it_again_sam," Play It Again, Sam (1972) concerns neurotic San Francisco film critic and fanatical movie buff, Allan Felix (Woody Allen)."
m/play_it_to_the_bone," The film's slowly emerging weakness -- the thinness of the characters, particularly Harrelson's -- becomes apparent to the point of distraction."
m/play_misty_for_me, Terrific tale of romantic obsession that pre-dated Fatal Attraction
m/play_the_game," The comedy's broad perfs, predictable story beats and pro but characterless packaging have a smallscreen feel."
m/playback_2011, Playback is a movie that had the potential to be good but suffers from terrible writing and a director who should have let someone have a pass at his script to get things tightened up
m/players_club," Feisty, funky, sympathetic without being condescending to the bad hand dealt many single mothers, and rudely funny to boot."
m/playing_by_heart," Eventually and predictably, the movie, written and directed by Willard Carroll, brings all of the disparate pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle that is solved, miraculously, by dropping all of the pieces on the floor."
m/playing_for_keeps_2012," If Gerard Butler exudes rakish charm and Jessica Biel a charming flintiness, then why is Playing for Keeps so utterly charmless?"
m/playing_god," This may not be a great movie, but for both Duchovny and Hutton, it's a turning point."
m/playing_it_cool," Playing It Cool is perfectly adequate date-night fare, but it would have benefited from stretching its legs and seeing more of the world."
m/playmobil_the_movie, It's safe to say that anyone who has already reached double digits will find little to enjoy in this generic and lifeless promotional tool...
m/playtime, Playtime is an adamant vision whose failure is integral to its philosophy. It is a befitting fate that Tati's art was not endorsed by popularity.
m/plaza_suite," For Matthau it is a tour de force, a reminder that before the man became heavily in demand as a comic performer he was one of the best character actors in the business."
m/pleasantville," Funny for about half an hour, Pleasantville thereafter becomes an increasingly lugubrious, ultimately exasperating mix of technological wonder and ideological idiocy."
m/please_stand_by_2018, It's hard to be persuasive ... when your protagonist comes across as a collection of quirky tics rather than a credible human being.
m/pledge_2019," Pledge stakes its genre claim on fruitless anger, merciless abuse and satirical wit concerning what we're willing to do for popularity. Daniel Robbins does plenty with what some will consider a bare-bones take..."
m/+_one_2019," This rom-com made me laugh a lot. Fine performers and clever plot. With edginess, humor and heart, it charmed me right from the start."
m/plynace_wiezowce," A plaintive cry for gay rights and familial acceptance, the film is yet erotic and often rises to the giddy heights of an ecstatic, intimate pure cinema."
m/pocahontas_ii_journey_to_a_new_world," A slapdash effort, with none of gorgeous colors and animation of the first film and little of its emotional resonance."
m/pocket_money, A mildly diverting modern western and buddy-buddy movie.
m/pocketful_of_miracles," A painful experience, particularly considering the source (director: Frank Capra)"
m/pod," While there's something to be admired in the film's economy and tightly controlled atmospheric tension, its effectiveness is limited by the derivative storyline, mostly unmodulated performances and the obviously miniscule budget."
m/poetic_justice," Yes, things are hard. But they aren't impossible. Sometimes they're wonderful. And sometimes you can find someone to share them with."
m/poetry_2010," Gets to the heart of poetry with much affection, wit and intelligence."
m/point_and_shoot," I felt like a dramatized version might be the better movie, but so much of VanDyke's real story is captured and it's some of the most powerful footage you'll see all year."
m/point_blank," Pic speeds by in 80 minutes (sans end credits) of nonstop gunplay, pileups (of people, not cars) and occasionally exhilarating location work throughout Paris' streets and subways."
m/point_blank_2019," The Netflix action-thriller may be the same ol' exposing corrupt cops tale that you've seen many times before, but director Joe Lynch knows how to accelerate the material into territory that makes it exciting."
m/point_break," Bigelow has a sure hand in directing action sequences, and Point Break is full of them"
m/point_break_2013," [Point Break features] a number of impressive action set pieces... However, fans of the original will mourn the lack of memorable characters, quotable dialogue and the now-legendary central bromance."
m/pokemon_3_the_movie, There's no such thing as narrative coherence in this movie.
m/pokemon_4ever," Supposedly, Pokemon can't be killed, but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over."
m/pokemon_detective_pikachu," Detective Pikachu is a fun, occasionally-funny, and often beautiful to look at kids film that doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience and offers them positive lessons that are earned."
m/pokemon_the_first_movie_mewtwo_vs_mew, Kids will come away with the moral of the story: Trust your heart. Adults will just be happy to come away.
m/pokemon_the_movie_mewtwo_strikes_back_evolution," The Pokémon battles and declarations of affection provide what fans expect, but after 20 years, it all feels very familiar."
m/poker_night," The majority of it runs at the speed of the last five minutes of a Christopher Nolan film, when entire story beats are compressed into a shot or a line."
m/polar_2019," It's gross, it's mean-spirited, it thinks it's being funny most of the time but ends up just being obnoxious, and worst of all it squanders a very good Mads Mikkelsen performance."
m/polar_express," a rich feast for the eye, the mind, and even the spirit . . .a glorious evocation of . . . childlike wonder and whole-hearted ability to be swept away by magic"
m/police_academy, You know how people talk about a movie being so bad it's good? Police Academy is that movie.
m/police_academy_4_citizens_on_patrol," Just when you think American film comedy has hit the bottom of the barrel, it makes a supreme effort and keeps sinking."
m/police_academy_5_assignment_miami_beach," The real culprit is producer Paul Maslansky, the creator of the Academy films, clearly a man who can never be stopped, not even by a SWAT team of movie critics with blood in their eyes."
m/police_academy_7_mission_to_moscow," An inept, geriatric romp that's for completists only."
m/police_adjective," Beautifully composed scenes and few but memorable exchanges that border on the absurd anchor a deceptively simple story, giving the viewer space to think."
m/police_story," Not one of Hong Kong action giant Jackie Chan's greatest movies, but it's entertaining and provides loads of martial arts fights and dangerous stunts."
m/police_story_2," Even though Police Story 2 is the weakest of the franchise, it's still great entertainment."
m/polina," Shunning the crowd-pleasing, life-affirming tendencies of mainstream dance movies, Polina instead offers a lyrical and introspective look at the intricate process of finding one's true artistic calling."
m/polisse_2011," The film can be rambling and glib, yet it's no mere crime drama. It captures a middle-class French society that looks more humane than ours, but is just as messed up."
m/pollock, The pleasure of watching these two superb actors [Harris and Harden] play figures of such stature without a trace of sentimentality is enormous.
m/poltergeist-2009," If there's a case to be made for ""re-imagining"" classic cinema, Poltergeist isn't part of it."
m/polyester," OK, so it's not The Cherry Orchard, but who could resist a film where a massive drive-in billboard proclaims 'Now showing - Three Great Marguerite Duras Hits'?"
m/pom_wonderful_presents_the_greatest_movie_ever_sold, Morgan Spurlock shows he can be as entertaining a documentary film-maker as Michael Moore.
m/pompeii_2013," If only Pompeii had been entrusted to a more entertaining hack than Anderson; this is the guy, after all, who decided that The Three Musketeers really needed a blimp battle."
m/poms," Look, films need conflict, otherwise there's nothing for the characters to do. ""Poms"" never comes up with anything worthwhile to fight against, let alone cheer."
m/pontypool," ...poses some interesting ethical issues on the responsibility of the media, but like many a Stephen King novel (""Insomnia"" comes to mind), solid characters and a great build are undone by a silly underlying premise."
m/ponyo," When Miyazaki makes films that decry the threat to the natural world, every molecule onscreen resonates with that belief -- a belief that dissolves the boundaries between form and content."
m/poohs_grand_adventure_the_search_for_christopher_robin," Pooh's Grand Adventure may be a little more adventurous than Milne's own stories, but there is no questioning its simple delights and unaffected charm."
m/poohs_heffalump_movie," In contrast to Tigger and Piglet, Lumpy offers fewer incentives to take a trip to the theatre to make his acquaintance."
m/pootie_tang, [Pootie's] nonsense vocab eventually loses the power to impress.
m/pope_francis_a_man_of_his_word," The current pope's views, sense of humor, and magnetism are on display in Wim Wenders' documentary."
m/popstar_never_stop_never_stopping, The stupidly funny builds upon the groaningly funny only to be trumped/remixed/meme-ified until it's sublimely funny.
m/porcile," This isn't one of Pasolini's greatest films, though it's possibly the one that today best shows the warp and woof of its period."
m/porco_rosso," Believe it or not, my latest favorite movie hero just happens to be a flying pig. I'm not kidding."
m/pork_chop_hill," Gritty war, actually anti-war, movie directed by Lewis Milestone of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" fame."
m/porno_2020," It's not for the easily offended or for the squeamish. Porno finds a way to make the disgusting laughable, and I feel that it's meant to be a fun and slightly cheesy film which it all works in the long run."
m/pornographe, The Pornographer does to its theme precisely what pornography does to sex -- it isolates specific parts while ignoring the bigger picture and the larger meaning.
m/pornography-a-thriller," Frustratingly elliptical and slightly convoluted, but unconventionally and intriguingly structured enough to maintain suspense amidst its tangled web of blurred realities."
m/portals," A sci-fi/horror anthology that tries to tighten the format, but still suffers the usual pace, flow and suspense problems of film anthologies."
m/porto_2017," Two ex-pats living in Portugal share a sexually charged night of introspection in the second film from film critic turned filmmaker, Gabe Klinger."
m/portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire," Céline Sciamma's first foray into period drama starts out as a cautiously demure watercolour wash but gradually builds into a vivid, full-blooded oil portrait of the stolen romantic relationship between two young women."
m/portrait_of_wally," Turning over rocks in and around the New York art world, helmer Andrew Shea finds a lot of ugly stuff while chronicling what amounts to a 60-year hostage drama centered around the Egon Schiele oil painting that gives the film its title."
m/poseidon," You'll end up entertained if you forgive the cliches and let Petersen grab you with the visuals, from the avalanche of water in the ballroom to the eerie sight of a flooded crawl space where wires take on the form of deadly tentacles."
m/possession, Anybody who's ever been turned on by someone's use of an unfamiliar word will understand.
m/possum," Possum ultimately has to stand or fall on its own merits, and at heart is a serious and dark journey into the labyrinths of cruelty and abuse."
m/post_grad," Though supporting players Jane Lynch, Michael Keaton, and Burnett make a valiant go of it, the film, perhaps a casualty of its own meandering aspirations, never graduates to anything special."
m/post_mortem_2011," Larran keeps the action tightly focused on his small cast, closing in on a claustrophobic, macabre ending that works as a neat summary of all the deprivation and cruelty that has led up to it."
m/post_tenebras_lux_2012, It pains us to say that Post Tenebras Lux leaves you in a state of chilly bemusement rather than breathless rapture.
m/postal," Uwe Boll, comic genius... A bloody, unflinching, uproarious film... Well acted, well written, and 100% fun."
m/postcards_from_london, Art and sex-but way too much of the former-are featured in a whimsical but retrograde gay concoction.
m/postcards_from_the_edge, An entertaining mishmash with witty dialogue and excellent performances from its high-profile cast - particularly Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine as a battling daughter and mother.
m/poster_boy," By the final half-hour, Poster Boy manages a surprising amount of magnetism."
m/postman," There are those who will no doubt call The Postman the worst film of the year, but it's too good-hearted for that."
m/postman_pat_the_movie, Perhaps the army of killer robots wasn't the way to go.
m/potiche, Another perfect vehicle for Catherine Deneuve though too frothy for some tastes.
m/poultrygeist-night-of-the-chicken-dead, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead is loudly and proudly bad.
m/pound_of_flesh_2015," There's half a really amazing action flick here. However, you can't help but wish that it had gone full-tilt in its lunacy, rather than just partway."
m/powaqqatsi," There are images of astonishing beauty in Godfrey Reggio's Powaqqatsi, sequences when we marvel at the sights of the Earth, and yet when the film is over there is the feeling that we are still waiting for it to begin."
m/powder," Powder has all of the elements of a successful fantasy, and none of the insights. It's a movie where intriguing ideas lie there on the screen, jumbled and unrealized."
m/power_and_terror_noam_chomsky_in_our_times, Would have been far more interesting if its titular talking head had debated an intellectual equal from the right.
m/power_of_one," Though rife with worthy intentions and great notions, this populist safari manages to be both patronizing and manipulative."
m/power_trip," Like the best documentaries, this one raises questions instead of providing pat answers."
m/practical_magic," The title is, to say the least, an understatement. Witchcraft has rarely looked more prosaic and less sexy than it does in Griffin Dunne's Practical Magic."
m/prairie_home_companion, Rib-ticklingly funny at times and genial as all get-out.
m/prancer," Smaller kids will identify with Jessica's fierce resolve to get Prancer back into action, and older viewers will appreciate the fact that the movie takes place in an approximation of the real world."
m/pray_the_devil_back_to_hell," Even though the film is inescapably fragmented and catch-as-catch-can as cinema, its heart is pure and infinitely compassionate."
m/prayers-for-bobby," Poignant but as heavy handed as an old after-school special. It delivers an important message, but I wonder whether those who need to hear it will stick around long enough to listen."
m/preachers_kid," Stan Foster's film confirms the unique, undeniable power this genre can achieve on both stage and film."
m/preachers_wife, You'd probably get more enjoyment out of the soundtrack than the film.
m/precious," A highlight of Sundance Fest (winner of jury and audience awards), Precious is a vividly realized, emotionally powerful, inspirational chronicle of a poor, illiterate black girl who rises above her station, splendidly played by newcomer Gabourey Sidibe."
m/precious_cargo_2016, This lazily directed and sloppily written heist non-thriller unspools like one of those amusement park distractions where tourists play at being in a movie.
m/precious_life," Extraordinary...provides a gripping, intimate perspective on the ages-old conflict between Jews and Palestinians... Powerful stuff."
m/predator, One of the best in a long line of killer aliens to come out of Hollywood.
m/predator_2," Since the predator is imaginary but the people who made this film are not, Predator 2 speaks sadly of their own lack of curiosity and imagination."
m/predestination, A breakout performance by Sarah Snook distinguishes this entrancingly strange science-fiction drama.
m/prefontaine," The by-the-numbers athlete story is interesting, but leaves no lasting impression."
m/preggoland," Preggoland is a pale, predictable comedy that makes one laugh and feel too rarely, despite the best efforts of a strong ensemble."
m/premature_2014," Mr. Beers and his fellow screenwriter, Mathew Harawitz, also have a numbing Seth MacFarlane-esque weakness for purely attention-getting crudeness and unfunny stereotypes."
m/premature_2020," Authentically raw - almost to the point where it was painful to watch certain scenes in the film, Green does not ease his audience into Ayanna's world."
m/premium," Standout thesping by stars Dorian Missick and Zoe Saldana, along with fully fleshed-out secondary roles, distinguish Pete Chatmon's gentle comedy."
m/premium_rush," The script is terrible and the greatMichael Shannon is forced to sound like a 1930's gangster: ""Hey what's the big idea!"" and he's so over the top and it sucks you out of it."
m/premonition," Blithely unfettered by internal logic, exhibiting the pacing of a banana slug, and boasting a heroine who makes Betty Crocker seem like a radical feminist, Premonition is exactly the reason that the Razzie Awards exist."
m/presenting_princess_shaw, A moving look at how the human spirit and technology can intersect to produce art.
m/preservation_2014," Its pretensions about humans-becoming-animals aside, ""Preservation"" is still pretty fun, if paradoxically more so before the blood sport begins."
m/presidents_analyst," Theodore Flicker's genial exercise in comic paranoia re-emerges, for no apparent reason, a reasonably fit and funny artifact from the age of grooviness."
m/presidents_last_bang, a welcome reminder of how accurate a weapon the right satire can be
m/presidio, Peter Hyams' strong direction and Connery's commanding presence make this handsome-looking action-thriller worth seeing.
m/pressing_on_the_letterpress_film, Pressing On: The Letterpress Film is boring to watch despite the zeal of the people it follows.
m/pressure_cooker, Pressure Cooker belongs to the honorable genre of inspirational films dedicated to the proposition that one passionate teacher can make a difference in the lives of students.
m/prestige," Audiences might enjoy this cinematic sleight of hand, but the key characters are such single-minded, calculating individuals that the real magic would be to find any heart in this tale."
m/presumed_innocent," The adaptation of Turow's novel does a good job of presenting the evidence as needed, and no more than is needed, while allowing time for the characters to establish themselves."
m/pretenders," Flat-footed performances, a shoddy script, sloppy filmmaking and faux-clever homages to directors like Godard, Truffaut and Bertolucci that will probably only entice viewers in, well, the first year of film school, should they happen to see it."
m/pretending_im_a_superman_the_tony_hawk_video_game_story, Video game documentaries are a tricky thing. They tend to be great at covering surface level material. This look at the Tony Hawk franchise is a deeper look.
m/pretty_baby," The most imaginative, most intelligent, and most original film of the year to date."
m/pretty_bird, The three leads seem to be having a lot of fun with this somewhat strange material.
m/pretty_in_pink," Although it is not a great movie, it contains some moments when the audience is likely to think, yes, being 16 was exactly like that."
m/pretty_maids_all_in_a_row," At best, it can be viewed as silly fun and harmless soft core porn that offers a snapshot of a bygone era."
m/pretty_persuasion," Tough and cynical, Pretty Persuasion is a semi-engaging genre film with a twist, a variation of the female high-school satire."
m/pretty_poison," Like any good study in couple's psychopathology, a familiar relationship is visible here, but in a parodic, mutated form."
m/pretty_woman," A slick, instantly and entertainingly digestible Cinderella fable."
m/prey_2018, This is the kind of movie that seems to lay out exactly what it is right away before zigzagging all over the place entertainingly.
m/prey_for_rock_and_roll, Should appeal to fans of the riot grrrl scene and female-driven independent cinema.
m/price_above_rubies, Just about everything in writer-director Boaz Yakin's film rings false.
m/price_check_2011, [A] charming and slightly unhinged low-budget comedy.
m/priceless, Most of the problem is the absence of any perceptible chemistry between superstar Tautou and rising star Elmaleh.
m/priceless_2016," Strong message, weak story in faith-based trafficking drama."
m/pride," [The film] has enough buoyancy to remain afloat, though without the vigor of Terrence Howard and the charm of Bernie Mac, it likely would sink in its own sea of clichs."
m/pride_2014," Pride does not push the medium into new territory and was certainly not the most challenging or complex film in Cannes, but it was the one that moved us the most."
m/pride_and_glory, A familiar but taut thriller sparked by a quartet of committed lead performances and the visual acrobatics of stealth camera ace Declan Quinn.
m/pride_and_prejudice_and_zombies," True-blue Austen fans stand to get the most out of this guilty-pleasure exercise. Everyone else will likely find it tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt them."
m/pride_and_the_passion," As a war movie or a romance, The Pride and the Passion fizzles."
m/pride_of_the_yankees," First-rate biopic, though Cooper is hard-pressed to sell Gehrig as a college student."
m/primal," With a possessive big game hunter and a rare cat, combined with a smart, psychopathic killer on the loose aboard a ship at sea, you can kind of figure out where this adventure yarn is going."
m/primal_2010," Writer/director/editor Josh Reed's low budget Australian horror film doesn't really take his audience anyplace new, but he does so with effective suspense, decent gore effects and some well placed humor."
m/primary_colors, The picture is so funny at times that you may have trouble controlling yourself.
m/prime," A moment here and there may remind you of Woody Allen's better comedies, but Younger has put his own stamp on this familiar territory."
m/primer," Primer is perfect Sundance material, its bland, anonymous actors and competent, Sprint-commercial mise-en-scène masked in the guise of independence."
m/primeval," Strangely self-serious, and without covering the prerequisites of top-shelf nastiness that contemporary horror requires, this giant crocodile movie turns out to be neither fish nor fowl."
m/prince, This uneven but sweet bildungsroman is distinguished by its light tone and idiosyncratic handle on genre conventions.
m/prince_and_the_showgirl," Despite the star caliber, it's a minor movie--a curiosity--for both actor-director Olivier and star-producer Monroe, in large part due to the weaknesses of the source material and direction."
m/prince_avalanche_2013," Prince Avalanche marks David Gordon Green's triumphant return to compelling storytelling. Welcome Back, dude."
m/prince_of_darkness, Prince of Darkness contains the ingredients for a much better movie.
m/prince_of_egypt," There's a nagging disharmony between the grandeur of the tale and the lazily anachronistic dialogue, which spoon-feeds the audience."
m/prince_of_pennsylvania, Beyond their quirks these people are little more than unappealing narcissists. Ron Nyswaner's film is a royal waste of time.
m/prince_of_persia_sands_of_time," Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is silky to the touch, but slips from the mind all too easily."
m/prince_of_the_city, One of 1980's most value-laden and riveting films offers a compelling portrait of crime and punishment and all the stops in between.
m/prince_of_tides," The Prince of Tides is a big, messy, go-for-the-throat soap opera, the sort of movie in which every third scene feels like one of those soul-spilling climaxes they use for clips on Oscar night."
m/princess-kaiulani," British writer/director Marc Forby drains the inherent drama out of this true story, rendering it a one-dimensional period piece, suitable for the History Channel."
m/princess_bride," Occasionally a bit too clever for its own good, but it's all so cheerful and has so many ingenious set-pieces that you can forgive it any excess."
m/princess_caraboo, The great costumes and sets are more substantial than the plot and characters.
m/princess_diaries," ""The Princess Diaries"" just gives a high gloss sheen to a perfectly average piece of Disney live action entertainment."
m/princess_diaries_2_royal_engagement, This movie is so intent on going nowhere that it introduces new characters just to give them nothing to do.
m/princess_mononoke_1999," This is clearly not a movie for kids under 10, as decapitations and maimings aren't that uncommon and the story is detailed, filled with subplots, and low on cookie-cutter characters and cutesy sidekicks."
m/princess_protection_program," My Disney princess gave it an 8 out of 10, my son gave it a 7 out of 10, and my wife and I gave it a 6 out of 10."
m/prisoner_of_second_avenue," There's relatable, universal material in this property, but it often gets buried beneath a template that teeters uneasily between awkward pathos and obvious one-liners."
m/prisoners_2013, A masterpiece. The movie everyone's going to be talking about this fall. Jackman deserves an Oscar nomination.
m/private_benjamin," This isn't the army in the commercials, but it's Goldie at her best."
m/private_life_2018," They're such interesting people, and the person telling their story cares enough to make them real."
m/private_life_of_henry_viii, Laughton's definitive performance is reason to see this elaborate costume drama.
m/private_life_of_pippa_lee," Miller, who also scripted, takes a familiar premise but gives it life and originality, repeatedly thwarting expectations with quirky diversions and smart twists."
m/private_life_of_sherlock_holmes," Affectionately conceived, chock-full of marvelous subtleties, this meticulously constructed adventure-romance shouldn't be missed."
m/private_peaceful_2012," With the feel of prestige telly, it's nicely done, sweet and moving."
m/private_resort, There's nothing very new or original in this dull sex comedy.
m/private_romeo_2011," In the end, Private Romeo, with its indie budget, handsomely captures the uncompromising nature of young love, and ""it ends with a long deep sigh, like the breeze of the evening,"" as Samuel Coleridge said it should."
m/prize_winner_of_defiance_ohio," Let us praise Julianne Moore, who lifts it above and beyond the banality of a TV sitcom until it sprouts wings."
m/problem_child," There are amusing moments here and there and John Ritter offers an ingratiating performance, but that's about it."
m/problem_child_2, Better than the original. Hilarious hijynks including the best vomit scene ever!
m/prodigy_2018," It's a solid piece of work in as far as it goes, it just doesn't have much to say that's new or the brilliance required to make the familiar stand out."
m/producers_the_movie_musical," Directly translating the stage version to the screen, particularly in retaining the stage acting, undercuts the film, but still it remains damn funny."
m/professionals, It's 'guys on a mission' time in this wonderful but improbable tale.
m/professor_marston_and_the_wonder_women," [Robinson] shines a light onto the identity struggles so many face today and presents an unconventional life as healthy and, dare I say, normal."
m/program," The Program is a routine Joe College movie, with the added twist that Joe College is Joe Kane (Craig Sheffer), a prime contender for the Heisman Trophy."
m/project_a," There is not much difference between this film and most of Chan's other early films. There are the typical amazing stunts, comical situations and super thin plot."
m/project_almanac," Despite the uncomfortable sexism and altogether predictable nature of the film, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't modestly entertaining."
m/project_nim," A thorough and provocative portrait, which shies away from anthropomorphising Nim as much as possible - accentuating his animal nature as well as what might be considered more ""human"" attributes."
m/project_rebirth_2010," Rebirth is essentially a platform for discussion and listening, linking the audience and the subjects through a symbiotic relationship of understanding."
m/project_wild_thing," An engaging, persuasive and often funny film, strategically highlighting the worrying truth about how little time British children spend outdoors."
m/project_x_2011," [VIDEO] Be grateful for ""Project X."" It is a ribald romp for those audience members who require its healing qualities."
m/prom_2011," More material divorced from any recognizable social reality piles into Prom, as into an overloaded rental limo."
m/prom_night," Prom Night is poorly written, ill conceived, and executed with the excitement of a children's cough medicine commercial."
m/promare," The hyperkinetic action, the bright and cartoony animation, the hot-blooded energy, the sense of over-the-top dramatic flair that extends even to the fonts of the title cards; everything you've loved about previous Imaishi works is here."
m/prometheus_2012, [Fassbender's] performance elevates the film: a multi-faceted reboot of the requisite android.
m/promised_land_1987, Many scenes are extended to the point that all potential dramatic tension is drained out of them.
m/proof," The sparks go out in John Madden's film version, with a script by Auburn and Rebecca Miller and starring a wan Gwyneth Paltrow."
m/proof_1991," There are adroit little truths everywhere, touching on blindness, cruelty, loneliness, deception and love. Writer/director Jocelyn Moorhouse has a dynamic knack for psychological twists, and for suspense in the unlikeliest of places."
m/proof_of_life, An exciting travelogue into a whole new world of international intrigue that makes you think twice about travelling in the hot zones.
m/proposition, A mesmerizing Australian western that occurs in a raw and brutal land.
m/prospect_2018," Had Prospect zeroed in on this dynamic a little more, it would probably play a little better than the glorified directors' reel the picture truly is."
m/protagonist, [A] bold exploration of the... theme of extremism taken to the point of tragedy...
m/protector," It's like a mixture of Fist of Fury and Dumbo, with a small side order of 1960s children's TV show Daktari."
m/protektor," A reasonably involving, noirish look at a Czech couple during the German occupation of their country."
m/proteus_a_nineteenth_century_vision_2004," Homophobia and hyprocisy, history and legend, racism and jealousy, cruelty and love all figure in -- and prove too much."
m/protocol, Goldies Hawn is irrestible in this funny movie. But the treatment of Arabs is groanable and cliched.
m/proud_mary," If you have Taraji P. Henson, the wherewithal to invoke the badass funk films of the '70s, and the willingness to murder a pile of bad guys, then why not have some fun with it? Such a pity."
m/provoked_a_true_story, Provoked avoids sentimentality and illustrates how one woman's bravery helped fuel a nationwide crusade and irrevocably altered British laws on domestic violence.
m/proximity_2020," If you're a hardcore sci-fi devotee, then I recommend seeing this movie. If you're not, I might skip it."
m/proxy, ...the film benefits substantially from the inclusion of a very unexpected twist at around the halfway mark.
m/prozac_nation," This bafflingly awful film is as likable as a sharp blow to the base of the skull, which I would recommend before even thinking of paying to see Nation."
m/ps_i_love_you," The question of love after death has been asked frequently enough in the movies, but seldom with the high ick factor found in P.S. I Love You."
m/psycho," If you haven't seen this yet, you should consider it a vital part of your film education. If you have, it's well worth repeat viewings."
m/psycho_2," Surprisingly, even after waiting 20 years, they managed to turn out a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginitive twists."
m/psycho_3," The movie was directed by Perkins, in his filmmaking debut. I was surprised by what a good job he does."
m/psycho_beach_party, A promising recipe for comedy that goes flat in the execution.
m/psychokinesis," Psychokinesis doesn't leave you with much more than a bittersweet feeling about it all, but it's an appropriately different takeaway from such a refreshingly different superhero movie."
m/psychopathia_sexualis_2006, Everything you ever wanted to know about sexual perversity but were afraid to ask is on anemic display in Bret Wood's new film.
m/psychopaths_2017," Keating fails to effectively transmit his love of pushing the horror genre to new heights, with the result that we feel less gleefully complicit than merely voyeuristic."
m/pt_109, This is less a historical document than it is a satisfying action story.
m/pu_239, A surprisingly funny tale of a man dying from radiation poisoning.
m/public_access," Slow and a little smug, but the film-makers' imagination saves the day."
m/public_eye," A period noir thriller, in which Pesci plays one of his few lead roles as Leon (Bernzy)Bernstein, a magician behind the lens with an eye for life's darker side blessed with the soul of an artist"
m/puccini_for_beginners," Writer-director Maggenti knows her way around snappy, sophisticated dialogue."
m/puerto_ricans_in_paris, The film simply limps to predetermined truths that hypocritically advocate the maintenance of placid family values.
m/pulling_strings," This bilingual romantic comedy is overly long and has a paper-thin plot, but it's too sweet-natured to dislike."
m/pulp_fiction," Pulp Fiction is great American entertainment, a stylish and foxy comedy of errors."
m/pulse," Pulse, co-written by horror maven Wes Craven, is no Scream - but that doesn't mean it's not a scream all the same."
m/pulse_2005, Brings some of the creepiest imagery yet seen to bear on the question of how ghosts might manifest themselves before the living.
m/pumping_iron, Fascinating stuff when viewed in the context of Arnie's now notorious political career.
m/pumpkin," The filmmakers try to balance pointed, often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness, with results that are sometimes bracing, sometimes baffling and quite often, and in unexpected ways, touching."
m/pumpkin_eater," In this slow, strong, incisive film version of the book, the ironing out of a well-kept wife's unkempt psyche is portrayed with harrowing perception by Anne Bancroft."
m/pumpkinhead," Typically hollow and patchy, the script is low par for the course, the acting close behind."
m/pumpkinhead_ii_blood_wings," Most notable for a cast that includes Soleil Moon Frye, the former Punky Brewster, as a spooky teenager ('This stuff is way beyond Ouija boards, you guys'), and Roger Clinton, half-brother of then-President Bill Clinton, as 'Mayor Bubba.'"
m/punchdrunk_love, A delightfully idiosyncratic romantic comedy that manages to give convention a swift jab in the gut while still pushing all of the genre's requisite buttons.
m/punching-the-clown," A surprisingly warm variation on an often venal tale, Henry Phillips's pseudo-autobiography affectionately reflects, rather than coldly lampoons, the life of a stand-up."
m/punching_henry," It's the kind of observational humor that instills a knowing chuckle and nod of the head, as opposed to an all-out chortle."
m/punchline," Though Punchline defies the Hollywood penchant for producing either pure comedy or straight drama, its view of those with the guts to stand before an audience and dare them to laugh is oddly uplifting."
m/puncture," The film is chock-a-block with extraordinary performances and no one will fault the filmmaking either. This is a well-made movie, make no mistake. It just suffers from a dysfunctional hero."
m/punisher_war_zone," When The Punisher kills people, he really kills them good. Head shots explode out of nowhere with comic timing. They get that action movie violence is a joke so they don't try to justify it."
m/punishment_park, Watkins' convincing cinema-verite style contradicts what we know is an historical untruth
m/punks_not_dead," Pacy, broad-based overview of the punk rock scene from 1977 to present packages a who's who of luminaries and rare performance clips into a vibrant proof-of-life statement underpinned by keen analysis of sociopolitical issues."
m/puppet_master," With some weird, awesome puppets, a nice finale, and an interesting theme hovering over it all, Puppetmaster's a unique piece of the late '80s."
m/puppet_master_the_littlest_reich," This is tried and true shock cinema: wild, in your face, and meant to be experienced with the rowdiest crowd imaginable. The timid need not apply."
m/puppet_masters, This movie is so wonderfully archaic and reminiscent of 1950s alien invasion stories that one cannot help but like it -- despite rather lacklustre directing.
m/pure_country, Country music superstar George Strait makes his acting debut in an extended music video held together by a formulaic plot that harkens back to the Golden Age of Hollywood.
m/purple_butterfly," History is scant or purposefully blurred in Lou Ye's abstruse Purple Butterfly, a war drama with Wong-like delusions of love"
m/purple_noon_1961," Although ""Purple Noon"" is a singularly thrill-less thriller, it is lovely to look at."
m/purple_rain," A classic '80s rock movie, whose soundtrack was perhaps the best album of the decade."
m/purple_rose_of_cairo," It's a sweet, lyrically funny, multi- layered work that again demonstrates that Woody Allen is our premier film maker who, standing something over 5 feet tall in his sneakers, towers above all others."
m/pursuit_of_happyness, This is the saddest Will Smith movie I've ever seen. But the worser it gets the more you know how it'll come out at the end.
m/pusher, The biggest surprise is how you give a damn about what happens to Refn's bad guy--a testament to Bodnia's native likeability.
m/pusher_2012," Fans of the original will recognise this as a respectful cover version rather than an ambitious re-imagining, but it's got style and energy."
m/pusher_ii_with_blood_on_my_hands," In Refn's skilled street-realist hands, the child becomes a potent, wailing metaphor for Tonny's own dilemma of rudderless need."
m/pusher_iii_im_the_angel_of_death, You don't need to see them all to see Pusher 3. There are This is great third entry in a series that is of consistent quality through and through.
m/pushing_tin," Offers high energy, a fascinating backdrop and a top-flight cast, but has an unfortunate tendency to veer off the runway."
m/pushover, Novak does a fine job in her first starring role as a heartless femme fatale who does have a heart after all.
m/pussy_riot_a_punk_prayer, A rough DIY style doesn't obscure the significance of this very timely documentary.
m/putins_kiss_2012," An eye opening expose' not to missed, which reveals a 'New Russia' that looks a lot like the 'Old Russia.'"
m/putney_swope, A way of giving the middle finger to Madison Avenue.
m/putty_hill, Digs deep beneath the surface of the quiet doings of everyday people to get at the solid roots that bind them to one another and to home.
m/pyaar_impossible, Nothing stupendous here. Just a sweet and soppy flavour with a picture-perfect Priyanka
m/pyewacket," A simple premise, a steady build-up, and a fantastically creepy third act that lands with a punch to the gut."
m/pyromaniacs_love_story," The cast is fine, the direction fluid, but the story wears you down."
m/q," The only movie in which you may ever see a gnawed, bloody skeleton wearing a gold charm bracelet."
m/q_and_a, A ramshackle police drama that resides in the upper-tier of Lumet's ouevre.
m/qianxi-manbo-millennium-mambo, A mind-numbing case of style over precious little substance.
m/qt8_the_first_eight, [A] wonderfully exuberant and satisfying retrospective of the work of American auteur...
m/quadrophenia," ""Quadrophenia"" is a glorious representational story of male teen angst that transcends its British locations and great music with a sense of the confused romantic notions that young men the world over carry with them."
m/quai_des_orfevres," A thing of beauty, perhaps, to be savored by film enthusiasts and analyzed by film scholars."
m/quality_street, Even the film's star Katharine Hepburn said she found it repulsive.
m/quantum_of_solace," For a lot of the movie Bond is a particularly unsympathetic character, and often it's only Craig's performance along with the shifting morality of Bond's legion of enemies that forces the audience to root for him."
m/quarantine_2_terminal_2011, ...a blatant cash grab that has nothing to do with the source's sense of dread.
m/quartet_1981," Frankly, you'll find much better works from the Merchant-Ivory collection."
m/quartet_2012, Hoffman has a gentle hand with his ancient cast and a doting eye for the English country house.
m/queen," Offering royal entertainment, Frears' sharply observed, poignant satire takes viewers behind the closed doors of UK's power elite (splendidly played by Helen Mirren as the Queen and Michael Sheen as Blair) in the tumultuous week after Princess Di's death"
m/queen_and_country," John Boorman's sequel to his masterful 'Hope and Glory' doesn't equal its predecessor, but still offers a vivid snapshot of Army and family life in post-War England."
m/queen_and_slim," Queen & Slim taps into a current of social outrage and depicts it with vehemence, sympathy and two true artists' visions melded into one."
m/queen_christina," A revelation, wrung from the usual MGM bio identikit, but given shape by Mamoulian's painterly eye, and immortality by Garbo's ability to transcend."
m/queen_hungarian_rhapsody_live_in_budapest_86," This is a band who lived to be on stage, and this is the best document I've seen of that experience."
m/queen_margot, Queen Margot is like elaborate illustrations for a book we haven't read.
m/queen_of_earth, Hell is other people - especially the ones who know you best - in Alex Ross Perry's acidly funny and unnerving portrait of a psychological breakdown.
m/queen_of_hearts_2019, An insidious tale that delineates the transformation of a successful professional woman's personal conduct from supremely self-confident to malevolently manipulative and beyond.
m/queen_of_the_damned," A vampire flick for the MTV generation, [it's] slow, plodding, pretentious and pseudo-serious."
m/queen_of_the_desert," All the film adds up to, unfortunately, is a sweeping romantic epic made with barely any persuasive romantic feeling underpinning it."
m/queen_of_the_lot," This wonderful character-driven film about a young woman who, with every fiber of her being, wants to be famous is funny, touching and oh-so romantic."
m/queen_of_the_sun_what_are_the_bees_telling_us_2010, The message here is vital ... and Siegel retains the gift of making you dream of making a difference.
m/queens," The film's sexual-emotional progressivism not only shames our youth-obsessed, sexist film culture but the culture at large."
m/quest_for_camelot," The images are playful and serviceably lush, but the story and characters might have come out of a screenwriting software program, and the songs (sung by Celine Dion and Steve Perry, among others) are Vegas-pop wallpaper."
m/quest_for_fire," Quest for Fire takes us back 80,000 years to probe early human aggression, territoriality, dominance and education."
m/quick_change," By blurring the foreground characters and focusing on the background, New York City becomes the real main character of the film until the script falters near the end and Murray once again reclaims the audience's attention."
m/quicksilver," Finally, the ""ten-speed bike"" opus we've all been waiting for."
m/quiet_earth, Destaca-se de outros projetos similares por concentrar-se principalmente nos efeitos psicolgicos do isolamento sobre o protagonista.
m/quiet_man," If you love more recent Irish comedies, you might also want to catch this US-made, but thoroughly Irish charmer from yesteryear."
m/quigley_down_under, Hits the mark with its mix of Western theatrics and cross-cultural insights.
m/quill_the_life_of_a_guide_dog," It's tough to argue with a movie that features close-ups of Labrador puppies. Still, the Japanese feature Quill is one of the strangest dog movies this viewer has ever encountered."
m/quills," Quills [is watchable], if you've got the stomach. It's just a little bit mad."
m/quinceanera, A heartfelt drama set in the Los Angeles Latino community about a nurturing 85-year-old man who takes under his wings two rebels ostracized by their own families.
m/quincy," In Rashida Jones's documentary tribute to her own father, Quincy Jones, we see previous tributes to the legendary producer, which is just some next level redundancy."
m/quintet, a painful attempt at depth that comes across as nothing more than utter pretentiousness
m/quitters_2016, Schoolyard angst and affluent dysfunction come together like peanut butter and jelly in Noah Pritzker's feature debut as writer and director.
m/quiz_show, Redford again showed his good directorial skills and the recreation of late 1950s is almost flawless.
m/r-xmas," Admirers of director Abel Ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature, R Xmas, marks a modest if encouraging return to form."
m/r100," As compelling as R100 is in spurts, it's ultimately an exercise in excessiveness that only a niche audience will be able to fully stomach."
m/raaz_3_the_third_dimension_3d," The film world setting could be better exploited and Shanaya's jealousy made less mechanical, but ""Raaz 3"" delivers other goods ..."
m/rabbit_hole," Grief may be the topic under examination, but humor -- incisive, observant and warm -- is the tool with which it's dissected in Rabbit Hole."
m/rabbitproof_fence," ""the focus on the girls sometimes falls flat, but the rest is strong and executed with some precision."""
m/rabid," Chambers acquits herself well, and Cronenberg is nothing less than competent."
m/rabid_2019," Laura Vandervoort gives the performance of her life and the Soska's are back on form with this visceral dark fairytale. Seductive, sensual, and gory as Hell, Rabid is a rare example of a remake worthy of your time."
m/rabid_dogs_2016," There's no reason for Rabid Dogs to exist, as even character identity and motivation receives little attention."
m/rabies," Takes the standard stupid-kids-in-the-woods formula and inverts it to delicious, hilarious and extremely mean effect."
m/rabin_the_last_day," Frighteningly relevant, insightful re-creation of days leading up to that murder is a sophisticated analysis of the ways and means of extremist actions within a democracy."
m/race-you-to-the-bottom, Brown is never clear enough on how he feels about his own characters.
m/race_2016," There are reasons to wish that Race...offered a broader, deeper portrait of the man. Yet, as a celebration and evocation of a stunning moment in time, it's an engrossing and occasionally surprising take on an iconic event in sports history."
m/race_the_sun, A spunky film that celebrates a school teacher's enthusiasm and its positive effect on students.
m/race_to_witch_mountain, Action and sci-fi thrills blend nicely with comedy in one of Disney's best action movies this side of Jerry Bruckheimer.
m/rachel_getting_married, A film whose lightness of touch rides a wave of family conflict to perfectly balance smiles and tears.
m/rachel_rachel," Fine acting all around (Joanne Woodward especially), and sensitive Paul Newman direction."
m/racing_dream," For casual race fans, Racing Dreams is a real eye-opener. And it's a darned entertaining way to get a handle on a sport that can seem like a bunch of cars doing circles for a crowd that seems most interested in seeing that next epic wreck."
m/racing_stripes," The story certainly has its heart in the right place and will appeal to young horse-loving girls, but the script is not funny enough, and the references confused."
m/racing_with_the_moon, A small movie about first love with abundant emotional riches.
m/racket," Softer than it should have been, then, but still dark enough to lose yourself in."
m/rad," The bicycle acrobatics behind the credits at the opening of Rad are so spectacular that you wonder what the movie can do to improve on them. The short answer is, nothing."
m/radio," Like the carol the film proudly blares during Christmas season: ""Joy to the World! The Savior Reigns!"""
m/radio_days, A nice respite from some of Allen's more daunting think pieces
m/radio_flyer," Donner has never been known as one who directs with a light touch, and Radio Flyer suffers from the same sense of weightiness that has bogged down so many of his other pictures."
m/radio_free_albemuth_2011, A quaint labor of love blinkered by fidelity to an outdated text.
m/radio_unnameable_2012, As haunting and heroic as anything you'll see on the big screen this year.
m/radioflash, Radioflash is less a cohesive story than it is a series of ideas cobbled together.
m/radioland_murders," The movie just doesn't work. It's all action and no character, all situation and no comedy."
m/radius," Radius could easily be disorientating all the way through. Fortunately, Labrche and Lonard know when to step back from the questioning, and maintain a strong sense of momentum throughout."
m/rage_carrie_2, Not even worth direct to video. Just run the hell away.
m/rage_in_harlem," The entire cast is excellent, but, as you may have already read, it is Givens who runs away with the picture in a knockout, scene-stealing, starmaking performance in her first film."
m/raggedy_man, Raggedy Man profiles a lonely woman desperately trying to make it on her own.
m/raging_bull," The most obvious basis for the film's claim to greatness lies in Scorsese's devastating critique of the very codes of masculinity that shaped him as a filmmaker, and in Robert De Niro's performance, through which that critique is made flesh."
m/ragtime," Fine, sprawling period piece. A great swan song for Cagney."
m/raiders_of_the_lost_ark," Ford, in a career-minting performance, plays what would've been a cardboard cut-out in the 1930s as grubby, coy, impertinent, imperfect, phobic of snakes and agnostic (describing the Ark's magic as ""the power of God or something"")."
m/raiders_the_story_of_the_greatest_fan_film_ever_made," Raiders!, as a documentary, is much like Zala and Strompolos' film in that it's rough around the edges at points, but so utterly sincere that it's hard to deny after a while."
m/railroad_tigers_2017," You know things are getting bad when an instantly forgettable, nearly impossible-to-follow, Chinese-language action movie manages to score a U.S. release simply because of Chan's involvement."
m/railroaded, Held together by John Ireland's nasty performance as the heartless villain without redemption.
m/rain_man, [Levinson's] films are fresh and different from anything else being made
m/rain_people," There are acres of psychoanalytic material to juggle with, and Caan and Duvall are superb as the brain-damaged football player and the sex-obsessed policeman respectively."
m/rainbow_brite_and_the_star_stealer," Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer is not an especially imaginative tale, and the animation is at times lifeless."
m/rainbow_time," Foiled by a weak imagination and clear limits to its awareness, Rainbow Time doesn't become the strong feminist statement it wants to be."
m/raise_ravens," The film's vaguely uncanny and disquieting tone is due to several factors, including its emphasis on death, loss, and decay...In many ways, the film is a lament and warning for Spain's future."
m/raise_the_titanic," The movie is a misconceived, anticlimactic, wooden, phlegmatically paced and waterlogged travelogue that devotes so much time to its nautical machinery that there's none left over for even an approximation of interaction among the actors."
m/raise_your_voice," So pure at heart that, even with its over-the-top moments and cliches, one is willing to forgive the flaws and admire all that it achieves."
m/raising_arizona, A very funny spoof about a colorful couple who must have a child and will try to get one by any means possible.
m/raising_cain," Not everything about this movie works, but the stuff that does is almost totally because of John Lithgow's performance(s)."
m/raising_helen, Ladies: You're going to hell if your popping bubble wrap with male models instead of birthin' babies at home.
m/raising_victor_vargas, It wonderfully captures both the innocent side of teenage puppy love and the posturing that always threatens to end that innocence.
m/raja_2004," Icky doings, with a miserably racist depiction of North Africans."
m/rajma_chawal," Rajma Chawal does a far more commendable job of capturing the wicked passion of Delhi than most films, but it can't capture the passion of its people."
m/rajneeti," The partly stiff-acting and tear-inducing reveals shroud the film's more earnest efforts at dissecting the bureaucratic, back-alley dealings."
m/ralph_breaks_the_internet," Overall, for a film trying to cash in on internet culture, it's not half bad. It doesn't go for any moralizing statements about screen time or get on a soapbox about the potential dangers of it all."
m/ram_dass_fierce_grace, A fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the New Age.
m/rambling_rose," The movie is all character and situation, and contains some of the best performances of the year, especially in the ensemble acting of the four main characters."
m/rambo-first-blood-part-ii," A fossilized abomination, thankfully relegated to the bygone decade which spawned it."
m/rambo_iii," There are better desert war films that have more style and story, but for brawn and bang, Rambo manages to pump it up."
m/rambo_last_blood," Injects the heart back into the legendary action franchise, before ripping it out with an awe-inspiring avalanche of violence."
m/ramen_heads," Sweetly reverential and irresistibly eager, Ramen Heads is a heartfelt love-letter to ramen that can teach the world the joy of this dish."
m/rammbock_berlin_undead," Dreary apartment complex? Check. Post-apocalyptic undertones? Check. Wild-eyed, slavering undead with a taste for man meat? Check, check. But somehow it doesn't all come together."
m/ramona_and_beezus," Teen star Selena Gomez as Beezus may have top billing, but the real star is Joey King as her younger, gangly sister."
m/rampage_2018," Both San Andreas and Rampage are directed by Brad Peyton, and they share a bland disaster-movie sameness - you get a lot of Johnson flying around in a helicopter, surveying damage, trying to warn people of impending natural disaster."
m/rampart_2010," A powerful second film from Moverman, one that could probably find itself an audience beyond the arthouse crowd."
m/ran," Ran is a visually stunning epic, containing some of the most beautiful, colorful, breathtaking imagery ever committed to celluloid."
m/rancho_deluxe, Surprise: Frank Perry kept his wits about him long enough to make this mildly watchable 1974 film about the modern west.
m/random_harvest," ...it is the kind of love-found, love-lost, love-found tale that appeals to most anyone's sense of romanticism, nostalgia, and fair play."
m/random_hearts, Ford sleepwalks his way through his role. He simply can't build enough steam to get his performance going.
m/rang_de_basanti, Mehra's Bafta-nominated attempt to combine political drama and traditional entertainment remains entirely compelling.
m/range_runners, A tighter script and a bolder mentality could've truly elevated this to be something deeper than a revenge tale
m/rango," Spoofs such kiddie favourites as Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, the mystical writings of Carlos Castaneda, and Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy."
m/rapt_2011," Director Lucas Belvaux keeps the tension on a low, steady simmer."
m/rapture, A film that boldly goes where few films have gone before
m/rapture_palooza," There are a few good, R-rated laughs, thanks largely to a cast that makes the most of the material at hand. Still, it ends up being more amusing than outright hilarious."
m/rare_birds, A quirky comedy set in Newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on The Rock.
m/rare_exports," Developed from short films made by Helander in 2003 and 2005, this feels stretched as a feature, despite some wry commentary on Finland's cultural beleaguerment."
m/rashomon," The film is not only a landmark for being one of the most philosophical and brilliant films of all time, but is also one of the most entertaining."
m/rasputin_and_the_empress," Splendidly stylish, often terrifying with great turns by all the Barrymores."
m/rat_race," ...a handful of downright hilarious moments, another dozen chuckles and about 60 dead-on-arrival comedic misfires."
m/ratatouille," A terrific movie -- and an early contender for the Academy Award. With Ratatouille, Disney and Pixar not only capture the culinary heart of Paris -- itself a feat -- but also the hearts of audiences through one adorable little rat."
m/ratchet_and_clank," The lack of scope for emotional engagement and unoriginal feel means it'll likely be a distant memory by bedtime but, in the moment at least, this reasonably well-oiled enterprise has just enough spark."
m/ratter," even at a mere 80 minutes, this feature feels padded and overlong - and the ingenious way that the writer/director contrives to stage events before Emma's various devices also sadly palls through repetition. In short, needs more slashing."
m/rattlesnake," Quick and dirty Netflix thriller let down by a flat and unemotional performance by Carmen Ejogo, playing an allegedly frantic mom trying to save her child from Satan."
m/ravenous, It'll be on cable soon enough--wait for it and you'll thank me.
m/ravenous_2018," Sure, his script is yet another tale of several strangers teaming up to fight the flesh-eaters, but the director favors a more eclectic approach that's equal parts George Romero, Robert Bresson and Monty Python."
m/raw_2017," Raw is filled with surreally Cronenberg-esque peeks at vet training within the brutalist walls of the campus building, from dog dissections to a horse running on a treadmill."
m/raw_faith_2010," At long last a vibrant, emotionally rich, relevant, and timely documentary about a progressive Unitarian Universalist minister and the challenges she faces in her public and private lives."
m/ray," A rangy, straightforward and entirely engrossing biopic."
m/ray_harryhausen_special_effects_titan," Harryhausen emerges as a charming, likable pioneer, a mood helped along by the adoring nature of this profile."
m/ray_romano_right_here_around_the_corner," He doesn't seem to be trying very hard here, and the framework of the special allows for him to be just okay without the audience's feeling cheated."
m/raze_2013," The thrill of seeing women beat the snot out of each other is about all that Raze offers, though for a lean, efficient 83-minute genre picture like this, that turns out to be just enough."
m/razorback, The atmosphere of the Australian Outback makes this a decent oversized-creature-on-the-loose thriller.
m/rbg," A documentary that, like its subject, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is eminently sober, well-mannered, highly intelligent, scrupulous and just a teeny-weeny bit reassuringly dull."
m/reach_me, Plays like an amateur-acting exercise in which each participant picks a name and a couple of defining props.
m/reader," The well-acted film deals with relevant issues (first love, burden of the Holocaust), but it's too literal, and the second half is a disappointingly pedestrian court melodrama."
m/ready_2011," Just like his previous Bollywood masala flicks, Khan is once again in his element showcasing his on-screen charisma."
m/ready_or_not_2019, A terrific horror-comedy with buckets of blood. A future cult classic.
m/ready_player_one," It isn't so much a movie about loving old video games and other cultural artifacts. It's about loving to love those things, which makes Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the bestselling novel feel hollow."
m/ready_to_mingle, Bachelorettes is better than most of what's out there because it challenges the audience to analyze themselves and empathize with the female experience. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/ready_to_rumble," Not even a centuries-long, post-1985 Chevy Chase retrospective could compare to the agony that is Ready to Rumble."
m/ready_to_wear, I got the feeling that Altman didn't really have any idea what he wanted to say with this film (which he later conceded in a TV interview).
m/real_genius," Real Genius contains many pleasures, but one of the best is its conviction that the American campus contains life as we know it."
m/real_life, Real Life is funy in spots but is remarkable mostly for its Socratic open-endedness.
m/real_steel, Real Steel is much like Atom: clunky and a little flat-footed but charming enough to stay in the fight.
m/real_women_have_curves, Cardoso breathes new life into a familiar premise with this charming and sensitive crowd pleaser.
m/reality_2013," Reality is effectively Garrone's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,cruelly trapping Charlie in a perpetual hunt through Wonka bars for his one big shot."
m/reality_2015, Quentin Dupieux has a talent for rendering otherworldly concepts banal in a manner that reflects the stymied desires of his characters.
m/reality_bites," It is Garofalo who steals the show, demonstrating an enormously ingratiating likability on the screen."
m/reality_queen," Whether there may actually be a method to her dim-wittedness, London Logo effectively wears out her dubious welcome around the 60-second mark."
m/realive," While it will play to fans of cerebral science fiction, it may be less grabby for general audiences."
m/reanimator," Smart, funny and drippy. A modern classic of horror."
m/reap_the_wild_wind," Another overblown Cecil B. DeMille ""epic."" One of his lesser efforts."
m/reaping," Let's face it, folks...The Reaping is one eerie cinematic Easter ham that will be tough to swallow."
m/reasonable_doubt_2014," It moves fast (a rare quality for a contemporary thriller), but doesn't end up going anywhere interesting."
m/rebel_in_the_rye," Diverting, mildly informative and - to borrow Caulfield's adjective of choice - somewhat phony, heavy as it is on tortured-writer clichés and contrived art-imitates-life parallels."
m/rebel_without_a_cause, The performances of James Dean and Sal Mineo + the presence of some potent scenes of adolescent angst give the film vitality and validity.
m/rebels_of_the_neon_god," The acting and direction are solid, but the real star here is the city of Taipei itself and the squalid neighbourhoods where the action takes place as they further emphasize the direction-less future of their residents."
m/rebound, Director Steve Carr doesn't even bother with scenes of the basketball team misfits discovering their skills and a love of the game. He just assumes you know the formula.
m/rebuilding_paradise, The brilliance of Howard's film is that it forces us to consider the intangible pieces of our souls that we lose in the rebuilding process.
m/rec_2," Neatly paving the way for [REC]3 with a cliffhanger ending, it has enough invention and wit to extend the saga into a franchise even while the novelty value of the 2007 faux documentary has worn thin."
m/rec_3_genesis, Doesn't come close to earning the revery of its moniker. This is one misbegotten deviation from the norm not worth repeating.
m/rec_4_apocalypse," While it doesn't match the deliriously wicked atmosphere of the first two films, ""[REC] 4"" has its own special firepower and a determination to preserve blood-stained hysteria for one last hurrah."
m/recalled," Michael Connors does a fine job of not passing judgment on his characters, yet his depiction of his main character's dilemma is about the only thing he handles correctly."
m/recess_schools_out, There's nothing here that's compelling enough to merit buying a ticket.
m/reclaim_2014," Carmine Gaeta and Luke Davies' screenplay is constructed from plot mechanics, and the emotional stakes grow less convincing with every twist of the screw."
m/recovery_boys," The final outcome may be mixed, but viewers will concur with a sobbing Ryan that ""helping people who everyone else in society looks down on - it's amazing."""
m/recruit, A CIA thriller that plays some very tricky and entertaining spy games.
m/red," An amusing, light-footed caper about a team of aging CIA veterans rudely forced out of retirement."
m/red-tails," Lucas' clout may have brought this important story to the screen, but his filmmaking shortcomings keep it from being told effectively."
m/red_2," in a lackadaisical sequel no one asked for except perhaps his creditors, Bruce Willis seems unmotivated to smile at all, much less offer a series of emotions that constitute a believable or compelling performance."
m/red_and_the_white," Jancso's formal stunner, although concerned with a specific time in Hungarian history, is also a universal story about war, the human patterns of power and submission, and the arbitrary laws of the universe."
m/red_army_2015," Quite simply, Red Army is fabulous, one of the most fun and fascinating films of the year."
m/red_badge_of_courage," Despite the studio's editing hatchet job, this remains a powerful tale of redemption"
m/red_christmas," Red Christmas is just one missed opportunity after the next, and I'm left wishing Anderson had done more with both his story and his characters."
m/red_cliff," As a lavish spectacle, this historical epic takes us back to the great days of King Vidor or Joseph L Mankiewicz, when sets were framed by incidental stars."
m/red_corner," So unrealistic, so contrived and so blatantly ""Hollywood"" that Gere can't possibly imagine he's opening any eyes to the problem, or any doors to its solution, for that matter."
m/red_dawn_2012," at best the cinematic equivalent of a voting-day robocall to people who are susceptible to nailbiting, apocalyptic paranoia - even as a fantasy-actioner, it's too cartoonish to embrace and too dangerous to indulge."
m/red_dog_2012, Red Dog has all the ingredients of a durable outback yarn with iconic Australian characters and elements - except for the glue to hold it all together
m/red_dog_true_blue," A classic boy-and-his-dog tale, Red Dog: True Blue has a big heart and bundles of charm..."
m/red_dragon," Ratner's faithful, immaculately appointed new telling of the inescapably creepy tale will be an intense, unnerving experience."
m/red_hill_2010, Deftly balances its allegory of a nation's colonial shame with rootin' tootin' entertainment.
m/red_hollywood," In the end, this film is an interesting, but disjointed look at the efforts of blacklisted filmmakers to influence society. It isn't always successful in convincingly illustrating its claims, but it is historically important."
m/red_hook_summer," Beneath every scene, powerful music enhances the film's resonance in much the same way its hyper-saturated colors do visually."
m/red_joan," Most of the fun in Red Joan comes from such overthrown expectations, so it's a shame that the film itself fails to overwhelm - mostly proceeding along dully familiar lines and anything but radical."
m/red_knot," Not trusting his film's paranoid atmosphere to be sufficient, Mr. Cohen clumsily inscribes his influences."
m/red_letter_day," Taking its cue from The Purge (2013) and Assassination Nation (2018), this grimly allegorises a country all too easily polarised against itself, street by bloody street. For once those letters have arrived, everyone goes postal."
m/red_lights, Cdric Kahn's latest finds an elaborate metaphor for a man's frustrated existence in the highways of France.
m/red_lights_2012," The movie just sort of... peters out, as the fights between good and evil become less intellectual and more physical, and thus more common."
m/red_obsession_2013, Who'd have thought a film combining red wine with economics could be so informative and entertaining? Red Obsession is one of the year's best documentaries.
m/red_penguins," 'Penguins' is an involving, humorous, but rather slight film from the director of 2014's 'Red Army.'"
m/red_planet," Crash-lands in a desert of one-note characters, banal dialogue and a general lack of excitement or tension."
m/red_riding_1980," Each film is enriched by collective detail, but it would have been richer had they played off each other rather than extending the argument."
m/red_riding_1983, Anand Tucker's direction and Tony Grisoni's screenplay aren't perfect but is yet another work that stands relatively well on its own but is made infinitely better when viewed in the light of the first two films.
m/red_river, There have been many classic westerns but this Hawks masterpiece certainly ranks among the best of the genre.
m/red_road," Red Road does not make easy viewing, yet emerges as compulsively watchable."
m/red_rock_west, More proof that American film noir is still alive and kicking.
m/red_scorpion, The movie's reflective moments belong to Mr. Lundgren's sweaty chest.
m/red_sparrow," Overall, if you're a fan of the spy genre, there's a lot to like in Red Sparrow. If you're like me, however, you may be left wanting a bit more."
m/red_state, Red State is cleverly contrarian enough to get a rise out of almost any audience.
m/red_trees, The banality of Marina Willer's voiceover only goes to prove the old clich that a picture is worth a thousand words.
m/red_trousers_the_life_of_the_hong_kong_stuntmen," The great documentary about Hong Kong stuntmen, and their relationship to the Beijing Opera, still needs to be made."
m/red_white_and_blue," Influences of helmers like Larry Clark and Wes Craven are pronounced: The first half is pure montage, foregoing slick visuals so the characters' personalities, coupled with a disturbing stillness, take root."
m/redacted," There is nothing innovative about Redactive, either in form or in content."
m/redbelt," Doesn't add up to a perfect film, but Mamet's taste for character integrity keeps you cheering for the moral figure who leads us to redemption, despite the coincidences and the cliche'-avoidance maneuvers that get him there."
m/redemption_road_2011," Jefferson has nowhere to go but up -- and eventually he gets there (note the title) -- but, boy, does the getting there take its sweet time."
m/redline, Redline is the kind of movie where they spent so much on the fast cars they forgot to save any for acting lessons or screenplay rewrites.
m/redline_2011," Redline doesn't boast much of a high-art story or clever dialogue, but the animation, stylistics and tone are art and visual stimuli at their very best."
m/reds," Not as good as it thinks, but powerful filmmaking all the same"
m/redwood_highway," It is, among other things, a sharp distaff rejoinder to the male-centered, sour-faced ""Nebraska."""
m/reed_fish," ...demonstrates a lot of talent, but it's another case of a neophyte filmmaker not recognizing where his true strengths lie"
m/reefer_madness," a campy classic, full of awful acting and blatant misinformation"
m/reel_injun, Reel Injun will most likely give you a new perspective the next time you watch John Wayne battle Native Americans.
m/reel_paradise," Reel Paradise has all the feel of a labor of love -- about a labor of love. It's funny, heartfelt, gripping."
m/ref, There are too many funny things going on in The Ref for it to be a complete failure.
m/reflecting_pool," Whether or not you accept the revisionist view that 9/11 was in part a U.S. government conspiracy, this film is worth your reflection."
m/reflections_in_a_golden_eye," Huston adds a panting melodrama to the whole affair and throws in some rampant symbolism for good measure, but it's a joy to watch such a stellar cast at work."
m/reform_school_girls," A great idea for a trailer or a poster, but not for a feature-length film."
m/refuge_2014," [...] Refuge's true effectiveness lies in Ritter's distinctively non-angelic performance. It's the work of a woman who knows she's been dealt a bad hand, but can't bring herself to leave the game."
m/regarding_henry," Soap opera, to be sure, but reasonably entertaining"
m/regeneration_2009, America's current ethical vacuum: How did we get this way? Why did the hippies think they'd change the world? And why are today's youths mainly relegating their lesser Utopian fantasies to those realizable with daddy's credit card?
m/regression," In trying to combine the perceptiveness of a drama about mass hysteria and poor police work with the jump-in-your-seat frisson of a thriller, Regression is killed in the crossfire."
m/reign_of_fire," Reign of Fire isn't a classic, but it isn't Attack of the Clones, either, and for that I will be forever grateful."
m/reign_over_me," Bring a tissue; the emotional territory is profound, as are the two central performances with Adam Sander as a man lost in grief and denial and Don Cheadle, a man surrounded by success but who has lost a sense of himself."
m/reincarnated," The film is as lightweight as the ganja-puffing is plentiful, little more than a vanity project that allows its subject to wax philosophical on his past triumphs, tragedies, and spiritual development ..."
m/reindeer_games, Reindeer Games is too tricky to let the audience join the fun.
m/rejoice_and_shout," Gospel music to stir the soul, shake the rafters, and express devotion and gratitude to God."
m/relentless, Rather than provoking a twisted examination of the pathology of the police/criminal mind. Relentless unfortunately settles into a rather bland police buddy story.
m/relic," All of this is actually a lot of fun, if you like special effects and gore."
m/relic_2020," [Robyn] Nevin does a terrific job of building sympathy, then abruptly puncturing it."
m/religulous," ""Religulous"" (rhymes with ridiculous) is a funny, debate-provoking movie that dares to question fundamental beliefs that have been foisted on societies in order to enable brutality and prejudice in the name of a higher power. It's a call for humanity to g"
m/remains_of_the_day," Gorgeously lensed and delightfully structured, however, this is, in a word, wonderful."
m/remastered_the_two_killings_of_sam_cooke, The fact that it accomplishes so much in less than 90 minutes is a testament to the love and respect Cooke still inspires.
m/rembrandts_jaccuse, This immersive tour of the mortal manipulations fueling Europe's 17th-century cultural capital supplies wit and intellect while it starves the emotions.
m/remember_2016," The movie is undermined by wobbly plotting, unconvincing casting and a script that veers into unintentional camp about an hour in and never finds its way back."
m/remember_the_daze," Remember the Daze has the irony-free, instant-nostalgia earnestness of your high school yearbook, but watching it is not likely to conjure your own youthful emotions -- it's more like flipping through the generic memories of a complete stranger."
m/remember_the_titans, I'd hate to fathom a film community dominated by Bruckheimer material.
m/rememory, It's maudlin and confused-ultimately hampered by the poisonous pairing of cliches and self-importance.
m/remo_williams_the_adventure_begins," A disappointing film, Remo Williams was meant as a star vehicle for Fred ward and as the first chapter of a franchise, but, alas, neither thing happened."
m/renaissance," The feature is over-extended at its current length, but its look and style are intriguing; it is maintained with energy and panache -- and its self-belief is impressive."
m/renaissance_man," As strange as it sounds, DeVito's performance is about the only aspect of the film that isn't wholly fraudulent, if only because his typical feisty abrasiveness protects him from sinking to the level of Marshall's mawkishness."
m/rendition," The script isn't particularly impressive and with so many films exploring similar material, the film seems predictable and redundant."
m/renegade_2004," As it gets more spiritual and internal, it makes less and less sense."
m/reno_911_miami," The TV show excels with its short squad-car bursts of random inanity; here, the plot -- stretched out to 84 minutes -- feels like a dime bag tossed aside by a fleeing perp."
m/renoir_2012," Appreciative but undramatic look at the young woman who was vital to the Renoirs, father-painter Pierre-Auguste and son-filmmaker-to-be Jean."
m/rent_a_pal," ...Brian Landis Folkins is actually quite phenomenal in the role of David...in fact, the movie rests squarely on his shoulders and he delivers."
m/rentacop," Rent-A-Cop tried to recapture the magic that Reynolds and Minnelli shared in Lucky Lady (1975), but instead succumb to being one of the cheesiest action flicks of all time"
m/repentance_2014, A movie of modest means that nevertheless offers a fairly cohesive story and at least one standout performance.
m/replacement_killers," One cannot accuse Killers of possessing a kernel of intelligence, but it's still a stylish action film."
m/replacements," Achieving the dull veneer of your standard TV movie shot on the backlots of Burbank, The Replacements lets Hackman work at about one-fourth his talent level. That still gives him a big lead over Reeves."
m/replicant, Low budget and low thought exploration of promising idea
m/replicas_2019," Replicas is an insane tale directed without a fixed direction that is more comical than tragic, intelligent or, already less, interesting. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/repo_man," If it sometimes feels a bit like warmed-over John Waters, it's still a pretty audacious work. Any movie containing a Spanish version 'Secret Agent Man' gets bonus points."
m/repo_the_genetic_opera, Repo! The Genetic Opera is the real deal: a fiercely original sideshow freak-out of killer tunes and bloody mayhem unlike anything you've ever seen!
m/repossessed," fits in better with the slate of low-rent spoof movies, having more in common with Epic Movie than the original ZAZ classics like Airplane!"
m/reprisal_2018, Seeing Bruce Willis in the movies these days is damn embarrassing.
m/reptilicus," Awkward dubbing of foreign actors, special effects that look like they cost a buck fifty, laughably earnest dialogue, wince-inducing comic relief from a dim-witted character -- if ever a film was made that deserved to be showcased on MST3K, it's this one."
m/republic_of_love, The lack of vitality and dramatic storyline renders this tale about faith in love underwhelming and artificial.
m/repulsion," This is an austere, scary, and timeless Grand Guignol work -- one with little dialogue."
m/requiem_for_a_dream, Mr. Aronofsky draws astonishing performances from his actors.
m/requiem_for_the_american_dream," An interview with Noam Chomsky that illuminates the sad and scary state of affairs in ""Two Americas."""
m/rescue_dawn, It's very exciting to have Herzog nearly back on form as a feature filmmaker after his string of doc successes.
m/rescuers_down_under, A gorgeously drawn myth made for plucky children and very brave mice.
m/reservation_road," ...while the film is consistently entertaining, it never quite packs the emotional wallop that one might've hoped for..."
m/reservoir_dogs," A nod to such noir crime classics as Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing,"" the movie's more than savvy sensationalism. Suspense, horror and humor are expertly interwoven."
m/reset_2017, A beautiful and compelling production recommended to all ballet fans.
m/reset_ni_shi_ying_jiu," Breakneck chases, high-altitude jeopardy and split-second rescues upstage everything save for a flowery moral: No technological breakthrough is more disruptive than a mother's love."
m/resident_evil, A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it.
m/resident_evil_afterlife," Looking at the plot alone, it's a massive failure, but between the booming score and effect-heavy action scenes, it passes as an entertaining Jovovich show and gory bloodbath."
m/resident_evil_apocalypse, Shines in comparison to other entries in the lamest current genre of film: videogame-based movies.
m/resident_evil_damnation," If you're a fan of the series, this is finally the 'Resident Evil' experience you've been waiting on."
m/resident_evil_degeneration, Why is it so hard to release this and let us endure Paul WS Anderson's butchery in the first place?
m/resident_evil_extinction," There are moments when the film nearly has a sweet Road Warrior vibe going for it, or at least a little bit of Thunderdome."
m/resident_evil_retribution, Easily the worst outing in an already mediocre movie series.
m/resident_evil_the_final_chapter," As ridiculous and inconsistent as it may be, there's a conscious attempt to define the protagonist's story instead of killing time as has been the case for most of the series. Please, let this series die already. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/resident_evil_vendetta," It's worth a watch for sure, but it's also certain to be appreciated by fans of the franchise moreso than others."
m/resistance_2011," It's a great idea, and the filmmaking is sensitive and complex, although it's never as exciting as it should be."
m/resistance_2020," The darkness Marceau must have grappled with, after witnessing what he did during the war, is soul-crushing."
m/resolution_2013, A strangely tense and humorous meta-narrative about two friends experiencing weird goings-on at a remote cabin.
m/respire_2014," Aside from the innate understanding of female friendship dynamics, it's hard to see exactly what else Mélanie Laurent brings to this overly familiar story."
m/restless_2010," So fluttering and tender, so guileless, that you almost can't believe it was made by an old hand like Van Sant. Then again, maybe you can."
m/restless_city," Told in an elliptical style with a pacing and jagged rhythms that take some getting used to, the thrust and power of the film lies in its poetic imagery..."
m/restrepo," By standing beside their subjects under fire, the filmmakers bring you to your own jarring encounter with the stress, adrenalin and shock of combat. Should be mandatory viewing for every American."
m/results_2015," Bujalski grounds his characters in unpredictable yet believable ways. We go on their journey with them because we like them, and we like them because Bujalski doesn't force us to like them."
m/resurrect_dead_the_mystery_of_the_toynbee_tiles," Resurrect Dead works splendidly as a threadbare urban mystery, teasing out details and complications without withholding too much information."
m/resurrecting_the_champ," Ultimately, the film fails because it never answers the question of why anyone should care about this guy who cares so little about himself that he lands himself in trouble in the first place."
m/retaliation_2020, An intense character drama that has a few pacing issues but ultimately hits the viewer right in the gut.
m/retreat_2011, Excellent performances from the cast elevate this otherwise slightly flawed a hokey interloper story.
m/return," I've not witnessed a more torturously boring, convoluted, and eye-wateringly moronic chiller this year."
m/return-of-the-blind-dead-el-ataque-de-los-muertos-sin-ojos, It's only a matter of time before the film reverts to the pattern of poorly established characters coming to grisly ends.
m/return-of-the-secaucus-seven," a peculiarly literate lack of focus indicative of a brilliant novelist moonlighting, at this point, as a filmmaker."
m/return_2012, One late sequence ends with a twist that steers the film into a questionable bit of plotting that seems almost entirely at odds with the believable naturalism of the remainder of the movie.
m/return_from_witch_mountain, This sequel to Disney's inexplicably popular Escape from Witch Mountain is without the shadow of a doubt one of the worst-made films that I've ever seen.
m/return_of_a_man_called_horse," If this seems a little thin for a two-hour movie, believe me, it is, even with all that portentous music trying to make it seem momentous."
m/return_of_frank_james," The abstruse stylization of Rancho Notorious is still a decade away, though the frontier is already a severe plain enlivened by intimations of hellfire"
m/return_of_swamp_thing," Doesn't hold a candle to Alan Moore's comics that ran at the same time, but as camp it has its moments."
m/return_of_the_dragon," With the ability to write, direct, and perform, The Way Of The Dragon gave [Bruce] Lee his greatest opportunity to distill his essence down into a motion picture, and the results are absolute dynamite."
m/return_of_the_living_dead, The volume of stagy gore quickly reaches a point of diminishing returns.
m/return_of_the_living_dead_2, The movie's high points are its makeup and special effects. The movie's low points are almost everything else.
m/return_of_the_living_dead_3," It's kind of inept, but it wants to be better than it is, and that's sort of charming."
m/return_of_the_pink_panther," Sellers' return (to the series) was a triumph, so much so that the actor would complete two more ""Panther"" films before his untimely death."
m/return_of_the_seven," As directed by Burt Kennedy, this first, drab sequel to the smash hit Western Magnificent Seven, only retains Yul Brynner from the original cast."
m/return_to_hardwick," Return to Hardwick is a living, breathing moment from our past, reminding us what has been done, and what can be done."
m/return_to_house_on_haunted_hill," Most of it is standard fright-flick fare, with almost no emphasis on the fright."
m/return_to_me, Return to Me isn't as well-executed as it could have been.
m/return_to_never_land," If Disney wants to bastardize children's classics by imagining what happened (later), the least they could do is show a little ambition and imagination."
m/return_to_nuke_em_high," Even if it weren't a quasi-remake of 1986's anarchic Class of Nuke 'Em High, it would still feel borrowed and shoddy: Back is the cheesy green-goo spouting out of heads as students turn ""cretin"" from toxic food."
m/return_to_sender_2015," The camera prowls menacingly through the interiors, but the writers seem too content with their improbable conceit to bother with back story or character arcs."
m/return_to_the_blue_lagoon," The sincere idiocy of this film really has to be seen to be appreciated -- not that I think there is any need for you to see, or appreciate, it."
m/reuniting_the_rubins_2011," Like a cheap, uninspired ITV bank holiday drama in which a decent cast is left stranded by a lousy script and lifeless direction."
m/revenants," a kind of aborted film that's mostly about how paranoid people are, and not the mind-f*** that it really ought to have been"
m/revenge_2018," Ample style, remarkable tension, decidedly French black humor, and more blood than I believe the human body actually contains."
m/revenge_of_frankenstein, Easily the best film in the Hammer Frankenstein series.
m/revenge_of_the_creature, Less than the sum of its maddeningly redundant parts.
m/revenge_of_the_electric_car, This fascinating sequel provides a surprisingly upbeat prognosis on the transition to electric vehicles.
m/revenge_of_the_green_dragons," Green Dragons wants to be spaghetti with marinara, but it's closer to egg noodles and ketchup."
m/revenge_of_the_nerds_ii_nerds_in_paradise, has little to offer that wasn't done better by the first movie
m/revenge_of_the_pink_panther," Some people say that the Pink Panther films just got more ridiculous as they went along. Well, so be it. This movie proves that inflatable parrots are just as funny as dead ones. A classic and sadly the last real Closeau film. Recommended."
m/revenger, Revenger spends too much time on forgettable characters and misguided plot points.
m/reverb," In the end, this looks like just another crass, unimaginative and heavy-handed British horror. A shame, because the opening 20 minutes or so are interesting and atmospherically creepy."
m/reversal_of_fortune," reconstructs the infamous von Bulow scandal and makes it more mystifying than ever by presenting it as a real-life 'Rashomon.' As a result, Claus' defenders may question their position after seeing the film, but his critics may have some moments of self-d"
m/reversing_roe," While the documentary sheds welcome light on Roe's history -- on the road that brought us to this crucial juncture -- the filmmakers, perhaps inevitably, bypassed some key stops and turns along the way."
m/revolution-9," Appropriately cynical social commentary aside, #9 never quite ignites."
m/revolution_os," ... it's as comprehensible as any Dummies guide, something even non-techies can enjoy."
m/revolutionary_road," Revolutionary Road is a very good bigscreen adaptation of an outstanding American novel -- faithful, intelligent, admirably acted, superbly shot."
m/revolver2005," Any semblance of a cohesive narrative arc is junked early on, and those who can sit through Revolver and claim to have ""followed it completely"" is a bald-faced liar."
m/rewind_2020," Rewind not only offers the story of a victim's ordeal, but a brave and resilient spirit."
m/rewind_this, Incredibly fun doco that delivers the perfect hit of nostalgia for generation-VHS while educating the uninitiated on an important part of pop culture history
m/rhapsody_in_blue," The music is glorious, but the biopic is pedestrian and fictionlaized to a fault, and Robert Alda as the genius George Gerhsiwn is too bland"
m/rich_hill, An open-hearted portrait of impoverished American life ...
m/rich_mans_wife," The Rich Man's Wife is not a great movie, but it's competent and effective enough, and I might have been tempted to give it a recommendation if I hadn't felt so cheated at the end."
m/richard_iii_1956, Olivier's is a turgid rendition with little regard for how the medium of cinema might lend alternative perspectives to the text.
m/richard_jewell, Easily director Clint Eastwood's best film since 2006's Letters from Iwo Jima.
m/richard_linklater_dream_is_destiny," What Dream is Destiny makes clear is that commercial success really isn't everything, and that being a director who isn't bothered by it can lead to a singular if perhaps undervalued career."
m/richard_pryor_live_on_sunset_strip, Pryor hits the comedy running and doesn't let up until he's exhausted the audience with so much gut-wrenching laughter that you won't know whether to stand up or lie down.
m/richard_pryor_omit_the_logic_2013," Zenovich has assembled better-than-usual talking heads, all sympathetic even when dishing the worst bad behavior."
m/richie_rich," The filmmakers seem to think of their movie as a fiduciary fable, but they're not quite sure about its moral."
m/ricki_and_the_flash," For those expecting more from the pedigree of those involved, it's a fairly flat and forgettable dramedy."
m/ricky," Because Ozon doesn't develop his characters once Ricky shows his true nature, the movie's slightly overcooked working-class realism quickly morphs into a grotesque story of a mutant baby. The film's two halves feel almost mutually exclusive."
m/ricky_gervais_humanity," It is a much better, less fragmented, more controlled show than Science, and it is such a pleasure to watch Gervais work."
m/riddick," An obvious throwback to the stripped-back, small-scale sci-fi of Pitch Black... a fun flick with all the right intentions."
m/ride-lonesome," Perhaps the best in the ""Ranown"" series, alongside Seven Men from Now, Ride Lonesome one never once strikes a wrong note."
m/ride_along_2," To call ""Ride Along 2"" rubbish is unfair to rubbish, which at some point had a purpose."
m/ride_along_2014," Scene after scene of a sputtering Hart and a glowering Ice Cube, despite the fact that they were brilliantly funny in, respectively, Think Like a Man and Barbershop, their previous collaborations with director Tim Story."
m/ride_in_the_whirlwind_1967, An astringent naturalism forever on the verge of the hallucinatory
m/ride_the_high_country," A superior Western featuring two of that genre's greats, Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott, who were both in their 60s at the time..."
m/ride_the_pink_horse, Stylishly presented complex psychological melodrama.
m/ride_with_the_devil_1999, An impressive cast energizes Lee's smartly balanced themes of innocence and treachery.
m/ride_your_wave," The filmmakers' reliance on romantic situations throughout the midsection may have some older teens and adults rolling their eyes, but the final scenes over-deliver with a literal flood of action..."
m/rider_on_the_rain, Benefits from Clement's stark approach as well as fine turns from Bronson and especially Jobert.
m/riding-the-bullet," ...a nifty supernatural drama that features some truly terrifying scenarios, while also offering up a bit of well-placed humor and poignancy."
m/riding_alone_for_thousands_of_miles," When your dad says 'Don't be a stranger,' he means it--in"
m/riding_giants," It may take willpower not to run directly from the theater down to the nearest shoreline, just for a whiff of whatever saltwater magic sauce the big-wave stars featured in Peralta's vibrant docu are on."
m/riding_in_cars_with_boys," While the film sags in spots, it is remarkably rich and robust, with a wealth of memorable performances."
m/rift," an ambiguous, creepy study of conflicting desires and haunting pasts - as well as a literally glacial take on Don't Look Now."
m/right_at_your_door," With a minimal effects budget, [Gorak] still convincingly depicts a city ripped by terror and confusion."
m/righteous_kill," Except for 50 Cent, who can't act a smidge, the actors are game but the script is tired."
m/rigor_mortis_2013, Director Juno Mak might have pulled off this potpourri if it weren't for a cop-out ending.
m/rim_of_the_world," Lame improvisations and generic young teen rebellion beats. It's definitely bright and colorful, but the movie has no sincerity."
m/ring," Although The Ring has horror picture elements, it is more of an intriguing mystery and detective story than a shocker."
m/ring_of_fire_2012," Ring Of Fire compresses some sixty years in the life of June Carter Cash into roughly an hour and a half of screen time, not counting commercials."
m/ring_two," I see wet people ... in this lumbering, would-be horror thriller."
m/ringmaster," You'd expect this material to be dealt with in a careless and seamy way, but Ringmaster is a better movie than I expected."
m/rings_2017," Rather than surprise or scare the audience, it will only unleash laughter and yawning. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/ringu, contrasting the original Ringu with the current Americanized adaptation is akin to comparing The Evil Dead with Evil Dead II
m/rio," Fast-paced, breathtaking to look at and certainly amusing."
m/rio-breaks, Charts the trials of two boys hoping to win a surfing contest to escape the grinding poverty of Rio's Favela.
m/rio_2," Rio 2 is an amiable enough cartoon, as forgettable as its predecessor but certainly colourful and incident packed enough to be marked as passable family entertainment."
m/rio_bravo," The action-oriented, straight-up good vs. evil, moral- ambguity-be-hanged, Western star vehicle has never been done better than this."
m/rio_conchos, Routine but dark and diverting action-packed Western that lifts its plotline from The Comancheros (1961).
m/rio_grande, I like it better than the problematic Fort Apache; it's far simpler and more effective.
m/rio_lobo, The Duke rules with his iron fists in Hawks's wily westerner.
m/riot_girls," With a slew of allusions to '80s genre cinema, Riot Girls aims to reclaim the post-apocalypse for queer girls with attitude."
m/riot_in_cell_block_11," From the details of prison life to the emotional arguments, it maintains a tangible sense of truth."
m/rip_a_remix_manifesto," A forceful, vibrant and immensely entertaining call to action."
m/ripd," It's the sort of movie that, if the air conditioning is working and the popcorn is handy, can provide a nice way to beat the heat."
m/ripleys_game," Like most sequels, the film hasn't the allure of the first encounter; only the curiosity value of a second look. The script, by Cavani and Charles McKeown, is lazy and clumsy."
m/rise-of-the-footsoldier, Fans of British geezer films would be better off checking out I.D. - this is best enjoyed after a night at the pub on DVD.
m/rise_and_fall_of_legs_diamond," Strange and often grim gangster film, notable for some off-trail approaches."
m/rise_of_the_guardians_2012," Even tots may emerge feeling slightly browbeaten by this colorful, strenuous and hyperactive fantasy, which has moments of charm and beauty but often resembles an exploding toy factory rather than a work of honest enchantment."
m/rise_of_the_legend_2014," Despite the lack of innovation in the narrative, Chow has delivered a slick and polished production that holds the attention and satisfies far more convincingly than either of the writer and director's previous collaborations."
m/rise_of_the_planet_of_the_apes," A dramatic, tense and edgy work which poses a few moral questions and dilemmas"
m/risen_2016, Faithful to the scriptures (as it were) Risen is a sort of redemption story inasmuch as Roman Tribune Clavius (Joseph Fiennes) finally comes to believe in the resurrection - and in the personage of Yeshua (Clifton Curtis) as the Messiah
m/rising_from_ashes, Rising from Ashes is not just about a cycling team; it's a testament to what happens when human beings care for one another.
m/rising_sun," There are a few too many plot holes and logical errors. Rising Sun may be solidly-paced, but not all aspects of the production are as successful."
m/ritchie_boys," Another wonderfully involving story crafted by documentarian Christian Bauer (Missing Allen) ... is filled with great stories, many of them quite funny."
m/rite, A rarely seen but thoroughly captivating example of filmed chamber theater.
m/rite_2011," Kinyarwanda offers glimpses into the lives of Rwandans, young and old, religious and radicalized, in the wake of nightmarish carnage."
m/rites_of_dracula," An original direction to take a tremendously played-out franchise, but I think I'd have been happier with no eighth Dracula film at all, rather than this particular eighth Dracula film."
m/rites_of_spring," Padraig Reynolds's film has no interest in self-awareness, and in fact wears stupidity as a sort of badge of honor."
m/ritz, OK version of the play enlivened by occasional flashes of Lester creativity.
m/river_2016," Sutherland is superbly frayed, seeming to get appreciably thinner and more shell-like every minute."
m/river_of_grass," There's an element of wit in Reichardt's minimalism here that isn't present in her later, more somber work."
m/river_of_no_return, It's fun watching Mitchum and Monroe heat things up in the Old West; Monroe is at her most luminous as a saloon singer with a heart of gold.
m/river_runs_through_it," What compels Robert Redford to make movies from seemingly impossible subject matter?... Whatever the motivation, we are the richer for his labors."
m/river_wild, O'Neill proves to be a squeamish screenwriter. He doesn't allow his villain to do anything truly unnerving until the story's nearly done.
m/rivers_and_tides_andy_goldsworthy_working_with_time," Very few art documentaries are as deeply in tune with the spirit of their subjects, and the implications are enormous, since Goldsworthy is the rare contemporary art star whose work (what a radical notion) is actually about something."
m/rivers_edge, Serious societal comment interspersed with black comedy
m/rivers_edge_2019," Yukisada, a veteran who has made unblinking dramas about the young something of a specialty, has never hesitated to turn up the emotional and physical heat and River's Edge is no exception."
m/rize, Eye-popping lensing and an appreciation of social complexities combine for an entirely satisfying experience.
m/road-movie-2009," The point of this road-less journey remains mysteriously unknown though, given it's the premise."
m/road_games, An above-average suspenser concerning an offbeat truck driver who winds up stalking a murderer.
m/road_games_2015," Interesting yet over-long, melodramatic and fatally predictable, Road Games is a backwoods horror film with a sheen of class, respectability and Barbara Crampton. These things go some way to save the day."
m/road_hard," The truth is, I found ""Road Hard"" to be a low-key gem, a consistently funny albeit conventional story about a guy who's almost always the funniest person in the room, and is almost always his own worst enemy."
m/road_to_bali, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby keep the quips flying at a machine-gun pace.
m/road_to_el_dorado, El Dorado is a cut above most action-adventure animated movies because of the integration of Kline and Branagh's comedic talents with their cartoon selves.
m/road_to_guantanamo," Powerfully co-directed by Michael Winterbottom and Mat Whitecross, the film has a winning combo of excitement and topicality."
m/road_to_love_2001," Doesn't add much to the coming-out genre, as it has been established in countless Sundance competition films and made-for-television movies."
m/road_to_morocco, Always fun to be off on this road w/Hope and Crosby
m/road_to_nowhere_2011," The independent film world might never have asked for its own Basic Instinct, but it got one anyway with Road to Nowhere."
m/road_to_paloma, A one-note on-the-lam saga that's primarily notable for its simplistic celebration of the outlaw life through endless shots of writer/director/star Jason Momoa in sunset silhouette.
m/road_to_perdition, Marvelously combines the gangster genre with coming-of-age themes. First 4-star movie of the year.
m/road_to_singapore, Hope and Crosby still a bit rough around the edges.
m/road_to_zanzibar, One of the best Hope-Crosby romps highlighted by Bob wrestling a match flame-blowing gorilla.
m/roadie_2010, ...a one-note comedy whose darker undertones are never fully explored.
m/roadside_prophets," Tries its utmost to be weird and aimless; and if that's what rocks your boat, it ends up sort of hitting the jackpot for the chosen few."
m/roadside_romeo," Stray dogs sing, dance, find love and confront a gangster mongrel on the streets of Mumbai. India's first major computer-animated feature, a co-production of Disney and Bollywood giant Yash Raj Films, makes for an inauspicious debut."
m/roar," There's really not much going on with Roar storywise. But then you take a step back and think about what it is that you're watching. My viewing of Roar was set to a soundtrack of ""Oh my God!"" and ""Holy crap!"", all of my own making."
m/roaring_twenties, An epochal rise-and-fall epic of the gangster cycle.
m/rob_the_mob, Raymond De Felitta's second collaboration with producer-star Andy Garcia is a lively true-crime tale with a sensational turn from Nina Arianda.
m/robe," Among the interesting qualities The Robe has to offer, its sense of social transcendence ranks among the worthiest, alongside the film's demystification of religion, and decentralization of its protagonists."
m/robert_the_bruce," The film has an awkward structure that blurs the narratives. But it coalesces into an unusually thoughtful exploration of power, war and the desire for independence."
m/robin_and_marian, Provides all previous Robin Hood films with a final chapter
m/robin_and_the_seven_hoods, Saddled by an endless procession of awful musical numbers
m/robin_hood_2010," Scott has an eye -- and it's a very good one -- for sieges of castles, charging horsemen, hand-to-hand combat, glistening swords arcing through the air and deadly arrows whistling toward helpless targets."
m/robin_hood_2018," Everything is overwrought, but attitude can only go so far. The action, effects and antics are meaningless without just a bit of originality in the script."
m/robin_hood_men_in_tights," Maybe [Brooks thinks he's] catching those Naked Gun/Hot Shots whippersnappers at their own game. Sadly, no."
m/robin_hood_prince_of_thieves," Poorly directed by reynolds, the film stars a passable Kevin Costner in the Erroll Flynn role, but it's the supporting cast that shines, especially Alan Rickman."
m/robins_wish," This movie is sad, like really sad, but also inspiring. My main takeaway is that we need need a cure, or at the very least a better treatment, for Lewy Body Dementia"
m/robinson_crusoe_on_mars, A lowbudget and unnoticed sci-fi film that is a gem.
m/robocop_2," More camp than the original, but no less fun. the effects are outstanding."
m/robocop_3," ...at the very least, Robocop 3 works as a popcorn movie - something part two couldn't even manage."
m/robot_and_frank," Just when we think Langella's slowing down, that Frost/Nixon might have been his last leading role ... along comes this lovely, gentle film, reminding us once again of his extraordinary talent."
m/robot_overlords," Unlike its titular villains, it's sleek and it never malfunctions."
m/robot_stories," The last is the most touching, but all are skillfully made."
m/robots," Witty, smart, and neither written down nor schmutzed up in order to appeal to a particular demographic. . . the writers have given themselves over to pure sense of fun."
m/rocco_and_his_brothers, I recommend a three and a half hour pit stop in 1950s Milan.
m/rock_a_doodle, Colorful tale of singing rooster has perilous moments.
m/rock_dog," When there are so many sophisticated animated movies coming to the theaters, it's likely that ""Rock Dog"" may soon be forgotten."
m/rock_n_roll_frankenstein_1999," But a film this scatological, sacrilegious and down-right gross will not be something that many filmgoers will be able to stomach."
m/rock_of_ages_2012, [Shankman] succeeds in draining most of the fun from a vehicle that was all about the winking humor of its flagrant cheesiness.
m/rock_rubber_45s," Bobbito's storytelling is infectious, and the scenes of community outreach are heartwarming. May all such vanity projects have such a friendly beat."
m/rock_star," ...does an outstanding job of capturing a particular time and place, with an instinct for both the sublime and the ridiculous about an exceedingly odd period in rock history."
m/rock_the_bells, A Los Angeles hip-hop promoter tries to stage the first concert in six years by the legendary Wu-Tang Clan in this entertaining video documentary.
m/rock_the_kasbah, The film quickly settles into a depressingly one-note groove as a culture-clashing circus act.
m/rockabye_baby," Lewis, a seriously under-rated comedian, is always worth watching."
m/rockaway," Attempts at giving this ""Stand by Me"" meets ""The Sandlot"" an ""edge"" are overwhelmed by efforts to rub that edge off."
m/rockers, Rockers spins realist connections from de Sica to Shaft.
m/rocket_science," This unusually voluble comedy is as eloquent about love, self-realization and adolescent angst as its protagonist is endearingly tongue-tied."
m/rocket_singh_salesman_of_the_year," A surprisingly sharp workplace comedy whose concerns should resonate with oppressed worker-bees everywhere. After all, who hasn't at one time or another been forced to weigh ideals against paying the electric bill?"
m/rocketeer," .. has its exciting and amusing moments, but on the whole is a disappointment."
m/rocketman_1997," A slickly produced, reasonably funny family film from the company that does it best."
m/rocketman_2019, [Director Dexter] Fletcher films even the darkest scenes in a very flamboyant fashion and manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour.
m/rocknrolla," The style and energy, + the terrifically memorable characters, make it mindlessly good fun."
m/rockos_modern_life_static_cling," It's as if the creators of this film were dragging nostalgia-obsessed fans into the future, reminding them that culture moves on, with or without them, after catering to them at every opportunity. Whether you join in on the laughter is on you."
m/rockstar_2011," A simple story, beautifully enacted, perfectly crafted, there is not much to fault in this film. Exemplary cinema by any standards."
m/rocky_balboa, A certified crowd pleaser. Stallone stayed true to Rocky. He gave Rocky back to us without dolling him up.
m/rocky_horror_picture_show," a dizzying experience, made all the more so if you are lucky enough to see it in a theater with a crowd who knows all the lyrics, dance moves, and proper audience responses to yell back at the screen"
m/rocky_ii," While cruder than the first film, Rocky II successfully drives its hero back to the underdog status needed to make the final fight as exciting and satisfying as it is."
m/rocky_iii, Another return to the ring for Rocky Balboa sees Stallone ditch drama for all-out adrenalin-fuelled entertainment.
m/rocky_iv," Even Sylvester Stallone seems to be getting tired of the series; as the writer and director, as well as the star, he puts himself through the same old paces."
m/rocky_road_to_dublin, This is a tough but tender snapshot whose sociological and artistic merits have stood the test of time.
m/rocky_v," In Rock V, the underdog is officially diagnosed as 'brain damaged.' Yo. So what else is new?"
m/rodan," An entertaining, well-made monster movie with absolutely nothing on its mind."
m/rodents_of_unusual_size, Rodents Of Unusual Size is a lesson in just how much a canny filmmaker can fit into a documentary that's barely an hour long.
m/rodin_2018, Even culture vultures will have their senses dulled by this ploddingly didactic two-hour lesson in the life and loves of master sculptor Rodin.
m/rodney_king, The play feels like stumbling upon an ancient spell.
m/roger_and_me," While not as good as Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me does show delirious hints of what was yet to come."
m/roger_cormans_death_race_2050," It's not necessarily a ""good"" movie-it's ragged and choppy and scattershot, with broad, cartoonish gags and easy jabs over pointed satire-but it's also fun, unpretentious, cheeky, energetic, gleefully trashy, and filled with junky spectacle."
m/roger_dodger," A fresh, original look at sex, replete with scathing humor, pathos and memorable characters."
m/roger_waters_the_wall," This is not merely bravura stadium prog-rock for Pink Floyd fans, but a curious home road movie."
m/rogue_2020," Rogue should proudly occupy so-bad-it's-good territory, but aside from a lion sprung to life on what looks like PlayStation 2 hardware, there's nothing fun or entertaining about this grossly incompetent Predator knock-off."
m/rogue_one_a_star_wars_story," Jones' portrayal is quite different from what we have come to expect from the Oscar nominee, and she proves she can handle the role of an action heroine with surprising ferocity."
m/role_models, A very funny comedy that celebrates misfits who reach across the generations to salute each other as the wacky and wonderful oddballs they are.
m/roll_bounce, Roll Bounce spins an endearing but wildly uneven coming-of-age drama set against the popular '70s phenomenon of 'jam skating.'
m/rollerball," The performances of star player, James Caan, drawn into the politics behind the sport and John Houseman as a creepy corporate boss, are excellent."
m/rollerball_2002," A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud, violent and mindless."
m/rolling_family," The film has humanity to burn, but its loose structure makes it hard to connect with the multiple characters."
m/rolling_thunder_revue_a_bob_dylan_story_by_martin_scorsese, Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese is certainly an astonishing achievement in film.
m/rollover," Alan J. Pakula's Rollover is a moody, evocative, wispy thriller that makes some intriguing moves before dissolving like a wet tissue in irresolution."
m/roma_2018," [Cuarón] tables the showiness of Children of Men and Gravity in favor of ongoing restraint, creating a fresh kind of intimacy."
m/roman_de_gare, The problem with Roman de Gare is that the tale grabs you more than the telling.
m/roman_holiday," Director William Wyler delivers some of the most stunning black and white visions of Rome ever put on film. Considering how many eye-filling extravaganzas have been set in the eternal city, that's really saying something."
m/roman_j_israel_esq," Roman is a fantastic character, and Washington's high-wire performance is one of his most daring and compelling."
m/roman_polanski_wanted_and_desired," Is Polanski a great filmmaker who made a mistake, or a perverted coward who ran from the law instead of facing the music?"
m/romance_and_cigarettes," It isn't funny, magical, or realistic. In fact, it's downright unwatchable."
m/romance_on_the_high_seas," Ditected by Michael Curtiz (Casablanca), this musical marks the feature debut of Doris Day, and its best part are the songs, including the Oscar-nominated tune, It's Magic."
m/romancing_the_stone, [A] fine example of 1980s Hollywood's craftsmanship.
m/romantico, Romantico works best as a beautifully executed and inspirational work of self-sacrifice.
m/romantics_anonymous, Carr and Poelvoorde inhabit this offbeat romance with subtle comic skill.
m/romeo_and_juliet_2012," The film's safe approach provides an inviting surface but never risks digging into the material. The lovers are impassioned, but the telling is only lukewarm."
m/romeo_and_juliet_2014," The lovers' first scene together is moving, while performances by Jayne Houdyshell (the nurse) and Christian Camargo (Mercutio) growl with intelligence."
m/romeo_and_juliet_in_yiddish," The story has running some real comic possibilities, but few make it to the finish line"
m/romeo_and_juliet_sealed_with_a_kiss, A comprehensive list of what's wrong with Romeo & Juliet: Sealed With a Kiss would stretch farther than the unabridged works of William S.
m/romeo_is_bleeding," Basically, there's nothing new or revolutionary about Mona."
m/romeo_must_die," Romeo Must Die has a great look and an edgy feel, along with some broad swaths of humor."
m/romero," The film's weakness is a certain implacable predictability: We can feel at every moment what must happen next, and the over-all trajectory of the film seems ordained even in the first few shots. As a result, the film doesn't stir many passions."
m/romper_stomper," At times very powerful and thought-provoking film, but this impression might be diluted with some of less fortunate creative decisions."
m/romulus_my_father, A beautiful mediation on the struggle of immigrants in Australia and the power of the father-son bond.
m/romy_and_micheles_high_school_reunion," Isn't so much a movie as an overly long pilot episode of some new ""Must See TV'' sitcom."
m/rondo_2018," It may ultimately be an exploitation movie, but I love exploitation - especially when it's as smart, as unpredictable, and as nasty as Rondo is."
m/ronin," All the players are good, so what happened? They forgot that we, the audience, could think."
m/rookie_of_the_year, Above average baseball yarn with director Stern and friends paying homage to their beloved Cubbies.
m/room_2015," A devastating, must-see movie. Finds hope and tenderness in an inhuman situation."
m/room_237_2012, There's something quite charming about Ascher's refusal to outright dismiss his subjects' hallucinations.
m/room_6," If you're a hardcore horror completist, I'd say it might be worth a Netflix rental, but that's about it."
m/room_for_rent, Let's not kid ourselves: this is Little and Gelman's picture all the way.
m/room_for_rent_2019," Tommy Stoval's unpretentious descent into madness has a mercifully short running time. Fun and chilling, this bed-and-breakfast gets an extra star for its committed hostess."
m/roommates," Falk is good, but this is ultimately an exercise in shameless manipulation."
m/rooster-cogburn, A sort of controlled experiment in what happens when two completely incompatible movie stars occupy the same physical space.
m/rope," Rope is not merely a stunt that is justified by the extraordinary career that contains it, but one of the movies that makes that career extraordinary."
m/rory_oshea_was_here, A heart-warming look at those suffering from debilitating disease
m/rory_scovel_tries_stand_up_for_the_first_time," The jokes are there, and they are funny, but the key is how he always keeps the audience on their toes."
m/rose_marie_1936," Rose Marie (1936) is the film with the best-remembered pairing of ""America's Singing Sweethearts."""
m/roseanne_for_president," It will likely stoke curiosity among those who followed (or weren't aware of) Barr's candidacy, but its flippant approach makes it more of a specialty item for fans than a heavyweight issue doc."
m/rosemarys_baby," Rosemary's Baby (1968) is Polish director Roman Polanski's first American film and his second, scary horror film - following his first disturbing film"
m/rosencrantz_and_guildenstern_are_dead," As a movie, this material, freely adapted by Stoppard, is boring and endless. It lies flat on the screen, hardly stirring."
m/rosencrantz_and_guildenstern_are_undead, Displays both sharp literary intelligence and tongue-in-cheek pop silliness.
m/rosenstrasse, A heartwarming and suspenseful look at a little-known event that occurred when 'Aryan' women risked their lives to save their Jewish husbands during WWII.
m/rosewater," A certain narrative conventionality is perhaps inevitable with this type of material, but Rosewater is helped immensely by Gael García Bernal's assured, lived-in lead performance."
m/rosewood," A crisply constructed, moving, true-life tale about human beings at their best and worst."
m/rough_night, Rough Night didn't rewrite the book and it's often thoroughly silly. But it's also - like hen's nights are supposed to be but never are - a lot of fun.
m/round_midnight," You do not need to know a lot about jazz to appreciate what is going on because, in a certain sense, this movie teaches you everything about jazz that you really need to know."
m/roustabout," An entertaining Elvis film--and no, that's not an oxymoron."
m/roving_mars, The movie is more compelling than exciting with one exception: the kind of rocket blast-off sequence for which IMAX screens were seemingly invented.
m/roxanne," Shockingly dated, but saved by Martin's effervescent charm and Hannah's radiant beauty."
m/roxanne_roxanne, Gets by on the swagger of newcomer Chante Adams' furious performance and its immersion into the style and culture of hip-hop
m/roxie_hart," I cannot imagine a film as amusing, biting, erudite, witty, and just plain fun as Roxie Hart being made today, and that is a terribly depressing thought."
m/royal_wedding," Though famous for the number where Astaire dances on the ceiling, this is lower grade material."
m/rubber, A film brimming with comic brilliance and manic originality.
m/ruby_bridges," What sets this film apart from its typically treacly ilk is the the strong, subtle work by the cast."
m/ruby_sparks," The great romantic gem of the summer, a diamond in the rough that bends genres, tickles the fancy and trips up expectations."
m/rudderless, Rudderless is the greatest film to emerge from Sundance this year.
m/rudo_y_cursi," I wish the first work from Cha Cha Cha, headed by Cuaron, del Toro and Innaritu, were better than this saga, a deconstruction of American sports and siblings yarns, which has amusing moments due to chemistry between Luna and Bernal."
m/rudolph_and_frosty_christmas_in_july," The attempts to turn these corny stories into some sort of epic strain with flopsweat, and the hoped-for Avengers-style team-up of the company's big two mostly results in scenes where you wonder why Frosty's not melting in the middle of July."
m/rudy," Astin's performance is so self-effacing, so focused and low-key, that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. And the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse, just the way it's supposed to be."
m/rugrats_go_wild, t delights me to see that kids today... appreciate such an imaginative crew of enthusiastic youngsters as Tommy Pickles and his pals.
m/rugrats_in_paris," Despite its hackneyed premise, the plot has a few imaginative twists, and the pack of Japanese sumo-wrestler waiters who grunt out a karaoke version of Bad Girls are a riot."
m/rugrats_movie," The result is surprisingly watchable for kids and adults alike, producing only minimal fidgeting."
m/ruin_me," Self-consciously reconstructed from references to Saw, Freaks, Shutter Island and any number of slashers, Ruin Me is a postmodern horror that makes its own manipulative use of familiar scenarios very much a part of its plotting machinery."
m/rules_dont_apply," It simply reminds us of [Beatty's] onscreen charisma and endearing humor, his handle of Hughes' descent into eccentricity and insanity proving memorably entertaining."
m/rules_of_attraction, Roger Avary's Rules of Attraction resembles more an Ellis novel than Mary Harron's adaptation of American Psycho.
m/rules_of_engagement, Tommy Lee Jones can be a sleepwalker when he's not emotionally invested in a project; here he's in high gear.
m/rumble_fish, Visually stunning but dramatically inert coming-of-age tale
m/rumble_in_the_bronx, The story is nothing more than a thin veneer and a poor one at that over a movie to show off the martial arts talents of Jackie Chan.
m/rumble_the_indians_who_rocked_the_world, A stirring documentary on the impressive contributions of Indians to popular music.
m/rumor_has_it," The story's a stretch, but there's something intrinsically likeable about the characters in Rumor Has It, an improbable romantic comedy about life, love and getting laid"
m/run-for-cover," Ray endows it with his usual themes of generational conflict and societal injustice, and does a powerful job getting these themes across."
m/run_all_night," While the dramatic themes echo the great crime movies of the seventies, it's the modern flash and muscle that ultimately win out in this pacey yet less than satisfying action thriller."
m/run_and_jump_2013," Run and Jump offers a bittersweet but warm story of love and loss, propelled by an excellent cast of earnest and gamely vulnerable performers."
m/run_for_the_money, When the opening scene makes you feel as though you've already missed about an hour of the plot you know you're in trouble.
m/run_lola_run," If an audience exists at all for Run Lola Run, it will likely be rabid video-game buffs with a passion for re-set."
m/run_of_the_country," The movie has too many scenes that work well on their own, but don't add to the final effect."
m/run_ronnie_run," The creators of Mr. Show bring the hilarious saga of Ronnie Dobbs to the big screen. David Cross and Bob Odenkirk deliver two of the year's funniest performances...as of June, this is the year's best comedy."
m/run_silent_run_deep," It's exceptionally tight work from director Robert Wise and screenwriter John Gay, who pays attention to fiery dramatics."
m/run_the_race," A great story combined with great performances makes ""Run the Race"" this year's ""I Can Only Imagine."" Tim Tebow knew what he was doing when he attached his name to this project."
m/run_the_tide_2016," Both the film and its star, Taylor Lautner, ore more scenic than dramatic."
m/run_this_town," Tollman manages to pull a muscular dark comedy from all this horrid behaviour. The debut writer/director shows off the confidence, skill and style we saw in Jason Reitman's Thank You For Smoking."
m/run_with_the_hunted," Some of the film's narrative threads are frustratingly unresolved, while others are wrapped up in arbitrary fashion."
m/runaway_bride, The well-matched stars pick up where they left off on that Hollywood fire escape nine years ago.
m/runaway_jury, You are going to squirm in Seat 13 of the jury box.
m/runaway_train, Totally ridiculous (and based on the work of Akira Kurosawa!) but very exciting.
m/rundskop_2012," Though the story is told and edited in a way that too often obscures rather than enhances its central tragedy, much is compensated by a career-defining, powerfully physical lead perf by Matthias Schoenaerts."
m/runner_runner," Risk taking and assessing the odds are the key components of this taut and highly enjoyable thriller in which dreams rely on a dice toss....a guilty pleasure of a rollercoaster ride with high stakes. And a satisfying one, at that"
m/runnin_down_a_dream_tom_petty_and_the_heartbreakers," Employs a warm and leisurely, though never sluggish, pace that's upfront about Bogdanovich's intention to take his sweet time tackling every topic of relevant interest."
m/running_from_crazy," Whereas American Dream ended with a moment of genuine devastation, Running from Crazy offers little more than surface-level tear-wringing."
m/running_man, The movie lacks any real tension and seems to be a host of fight scenes hastily added together.
m/running_on_empty, A tour-de-force in acting. Phoenix is a revelation!
m/running_with_scissors," If you can appreciate the film as a series of quirky vignettes, without the depth needed to inspire and uplift, then there is plenty to enjoy here."
m/running_with_the_devil_2019," There's nothing necessarily wrong opting to not name these characters, but boy does it really add to the blank slate of nothingness they all are"
m/runoff_2015," Runoff's finely-observed, understated performances invoke a kind of heartland neo-realism."
m/rupture_2017," Too much time is spent sneaking aimlessly around the building. And when the B-movie reveal finally comes into focus, it feels like a waste of a good set-up."
m/rush_2013," Aided by two punchy lead turns, an Oscar-worthy script and stunning in-car footage, Howard's race film delivers top-gear drama. A piston- and heart-pumping triumph."
m/rush_beyond_the_lighted_stage," A wonderfully engaging and genuinely interesting career profile of Rush, those most derided of prog-rock shriekers, tracing their path from anonymous Toronto suburbia to self-effacing power-trio legends."
m/rush_hour," Classy and brassy, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are a funky, well-matched duo in New Line's winning Rush Hour."
m/rush_hour_2, All of the original's formulas and alternating tones of goofball antics and deadly serious conflict are studiously yet fluidly preserved in this superior sequel.
m/rush_hour_3," Jackie Chan is stellar, Chris Tucker is lame and the film is, while proficiently produced, about as dumb as a sack of hammers."
m/rushlights," They say it isn't nice to kick a dog when it's down. But man, there are a lot of dogs in ""Rushlights""..."
m/rushmore," There's a sweet humanity about the picture, though it's anything but sentimental. It's odd, definitely odd."
m/russia_house, Sean Connery gives one of the best performances of his long career.
m/russian_dolls," Resonant with acute and accurate observations of people at that devastating stage in life where the glow and glory of youth is dimming into a dull realisation that fun spelt backwards is 'nuf, Russian Dolls is an achingly bitter sweet film."
m/russians_are_coming_the_russians_are_coming, The cast is great and the scene in which Carl Reiner and vaudeville vet Tessie O'Shea are lashed together is unforgettably funny.
m/rust_creek," See, you can make a feminist movie without the lectures. Rust Creek proves it."
m/rustlers_rhapsody," Although fans of Westerns will probably enjoy the movie more than others, Rustlers' Rhapsody will still prove amusing even for viewers who dislike the genre."
m/ruthless_people," Though ''Ruthless People'' has few moments to equal the inspired lunacies of ''Airplane!'' it's a true farce -- uniformly, cheerily nasty..."
m/rv, Slapstick and sentiment abound during the Munros' laugh-challenged trip to Colorado.
m/ryans_daughter," Overlength of perhaps 30 minutes serves to magnify some weaknesses of Robert Bolt's original screenplay, to dissipate the impact of the performances, and to overwhelm outstanding photography and production."
m/s_darko_a_donnie_darko_tale," I love Donnie Darko. It is ominous, funny, replete with ... well-observed moments. S. Darko is a callous attempt to cash in on its well-earned appreciation."
m/s_man, A darkly insightful and entirely fascinating study of the most disturbing material out there ... and why we like to watch it.
m/s_vhs," Bloodier, more intense, and on the whole more effective than its predecessor."
m/sabans_power_rangers, A campy yet enjoyable romp that honors its roots while carving out a place for this charismatic new generation of heroes that should make longtime fans and newcomers proud.
m/sabotage_2012," Sabotage is unusually dark and serious for a Schwarzenegger vehicle, but the star doesn't quite have the acting chops to pull off the moral gray areas."
m/saboteur," The movie has its enjoyable, even humorous moments, but the brooding sense of danger and fear so prominent in his other films, are more noticeably absent."
m/sabretooth," In the realm of straight-to-video horror, you could certainly do worse than Sabretooth. The film would probably best be enjoyed among friends, with copious amounts of booze handy."
m/sacco_and_vanzetti," Even those of us familiar with the case will find fresh insights into a crime and punishment that is, still, wrought with controversy."
m/sacred," An impressively global project yields an attractive, mild if rather diffuse film in ""Sacred,"" a respectful exploration by documentarian Thomas Lennon of faith and religious practice across the globe."
m/saddest_music_in_the_world," As delirious and idiosyncratic as Maddin's past works, The Saddest Music in the World benefits from more robust pacing, greater narrative coherence and less preciousness overall."
m/sadist, The key to its success is the decision ... to take time out from Junior's grooming as a movie matinee idol and cast him as a sniveling creep
m/safe, Director and writer Todd Haynes does a great job of leaving the cause of Carol's disorder open for debate.
m/safe_2011," It boasts an unstoppable, adrenaline-fuelled energy - from street-level chase scenes to shoot outs in hotels, bars and restaurants. Coupled with Statham's gruff machismo, it makes for a surprisingly satisfying slug-fest."
m/safe_haven, Most of the film is also very nice as the slowly budding romance is observed to bloom with the tentative nature of a snail on dope.
m/safe_house_2012, A competently-acted but utterly forgettable procedural that's full of exasperatingly idiotic character decisions due to lazy scripting.
m/safe_men," Safe Men whirls wildly from one bright idea to the next, trying to find a combo that will hold the movie together. No luck."
m/safelight, There's just not much room to work with [the abundance of] clichés.
m/safety_last, Combining the heart of Chaplin and the physical dexterity and daring of Keaton
m/safety_not_guaranteed," An oddly effective little charmer, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" ekes out a victory over so much of its indie-darling competition simply by following through on the ideas it introduces."
m/sagrada_the_mystery_of_creation, Sagrada plays like a video you might buy at the cathedral gift shop that outlines the history of the project.
m/saint, The Saint is all glitz and comic-book spy plot with no more than a passing hint that Templar has a real personality behind the disguises.
m/saint-misbehavin-the-wavy-gravy-movie," A much better movie than its off-putting title would suggest, Saint Misbehavin': The Wavy Gravy Movie will introduce many to a singularly altruistic individual."
m/saint_frances," In the most deft, nimble way, Saint Frances offers a winning story while getting behind a laundry list of important feminist issues, including postpartum depression and the efficacy of women dating younger men."
m/saint_jack, One wishes it were more outrageous and less knowing.
m/saint_john_of_las_vegas, Saint John of Las Vegas marches in lockstep with virtually every cliche of the modern independent film.
m/saint_laurent, We can never have too many scenes of half-naked beautiful people spaced out in slo-mo to Giorgio Morodor-like music.
m/saints_and_soldiers," ...it's the story that matters and ""Saints & Soldiers"" is a good one."
m/salems_lot_the_movie," Although this movie is old, and was made with minimal effects, it is still creepy - much more so than any contemporary vampire story or overblown CGI ghost tale."
m/salesman," It's such a fine, pure picture of a small section of American life that I can't imagine its ever seeming irrelevant, either as a social document or as one of the best examples of what's called cinema vérité or direct cinema."
m/salmon_fishing_in_the_yemen," Oddly enough, in much the same way that a master chef excels in miraculously transforming a soggy fish into a tasty dinner special, the director somehow magically spins a euphoric, emotionally convincing tale from an exceedingly eccentric premise or two."
m/salomes_last_dance," Outlandish, oversized, campy, profane and, finally, strangely moving -- in a way that only a Ken Russell film can be."
m/salon_kitty," Masquerading as an essay on decadence and Fascism, this predictably speculative slice of Nazi sex is aimed squarely at the box-office."
m/salt_of_the_earth, This remains a fascinating and powerful movie as well as a significant piece of celluloid history.
m/salton_sea, [D'Onofrio is] the fire in the belly of this cool groove of a movie.
m/saludos_amigos," A colorful combination of life action, animation and Latin music. A pioneering effort by Disney."
m/salvador, Salvador is long and disjointed and tries to tell too many stories... But the heart of the movie is fascinating.
m/salvage, It's a promising premise that soon gets stuck in a cul-de-sac.
m/salvation_army," Writer-turned-filmmaker Abdellah Taïa's lovely and elliptical adaptation of his autobiographical novel about growing up gay, effeminate, and powerless in Morocco."
m/salvation_boulevard," It's a stupid farrago of aborted ideas, misguided actors, lame direction, submental writing and follow-the-dots plotting that never comes anywhere within a 10-mile radius of what I used to call coherent filmmaking."
m/salvo," The filmmakers' very particular sense of lighting and framing, though handsome, often exudes a formality that perpetually stifles the story's sense of spontaneity."
m/samaritan-girl," An under-thought formula linking sex, youth, and violence."
m/samba_2014," The immigrant's struggle is brought to pulsating life in Samba, which works best as an affecting and amusing star vehicle for Omar Sy."
m/same_boat, A snappy script playfully stirs observational humour into a genre mash-up that mixes sci-fi with a hitman romance in the confined absurdity of a cruise liner.
m/same_kind_of_different_as_me," It can be hard to disagree with the heart and events of this true tale, except for when the movie reveals itself to be mighty self-congratulatory."
m/sami_blood," Although the film's setting and subject matter may seem a world away, it's an all too familiar tale of assimilation and alienation."
m/sammys_adventures_2," The script is flat, the storytelling is dull, and the animation is just sub-standard."
m/sample_this," The movie provides a vivid sense of the period, as well as an intriguing backstage look at the making of improbable pop classics."
m/samsam, It'll occupy the under-sevens well enough for an hour but it's a long way from being out of this world.
m/samsara_2012, An enthralling non-narrative documentary with images from five continents that becomes a guided meditation on the wheel of life and death; one of the best films of 2012 that you will treasure all your life.
m/samson_2018," The movie's most interesting clashes aren't between Samson and the Philistine royals, but between Pure Flix's intent to create ""clean"" entertainment and the obvious bloodthirstiness of the source material."
m/samurai_marathon," A mix of art and action that's occasionally uneven, but full of adventure and spirit."
m/san_andreas," This is a film that knows what it is and makes no excuses, happily owning its more cringe worthy moments while standing proud by its action spectacle."
m/san_francisco," A huge blockbuster, this MGM melodrama is mostly known for its ten-minute recreation of the 1906 Earthquake, but it also has an emotionally engaging story and is extremely well-acted by Gable, Tracy, and Jeanette MacDonald, who sings the famous song."
m/sanctum," Suffocating, nerve-fraying and deeply uncomfortable to watch. Just not in the ways intended."
m/sand_castle_2017," Sand Castle isn't exactly a modern classic in the tradition of Platoon, but it feels authentic in a way that I suspect those touched by war will find cathartic and comforting."
m/sand_dollars, The movie stands out because the directors opt to show us situations that feel real instead of trying to dramatize everything to get a reaction from the audience. [Full review in Spanish]
m/sand_pebbles, The total effect of Sand Pebbles is uneven though gripping most of the way.
m/sandlot, Old baseball wisdom: The best teams win with strong fundamentals. So do the best movies.
m/sandlot_2," Certainly funny, charming, and sincere enough to earn a solid B+ from the Sandlot-faithful. (And there are lots of us!)"
m/sands_of_iwo_jima," In one of his best roles, Wayne's Stryker is a sergeant disliked by his recruits due to his ruthless training and rigid code of ethics. The film established the two-generational plot as a Wayne staple, here contrasted with John Agar's ""soft"" soldier."
m/sandy_wexler," Just when you thought Sandler couldn't embarrass himself any further, he drops the laughless mess known as Sandy Wexler on Netflix subscribers."
m/sangre_de_mi_sangre," It will be interesting to watch the career of this director unfold, particularly because of his strong start."
m/sanjuro," Short and sweet. If you haven't seen Yojimbo, go rent that before this. If you haven't seen Seven Samurai, go rent that before Yojimbo. And once you've done those two, graduate to Sanjuro."
m/santa_and_andres, An interesting but disappointingly irregular study of two people during the Cuban revolution in the 1980s. [Full review in Spanish]
m/santa_buddies, ...immediately establishes itself as a pointless and downright interminable family comedy that's almost entirely lacking in elements designed to appeal to older viewers.
m/santa_claus_conquers_the_martians," shot in that hopeless, bad filmmaking style ... with the delayed, artificial rhythm of a trans-Atlantic phone call"
m/santa_claus_is_comin_to_town," Just say 'Burgermeister Meisterburger' to anyone over 30, and watch 'em giggle. We all know this story..."
m/santa_claus_the_movie," One would expect a holiday epic with a title like Santa Claus: The Movie. It implies something definitive, which would therefore put it in the canon of Christmas classics. However, this is definitely not the case."
m/santa_clause_3," The pogo vibe of the first two films is missing from the new picture, but what it lacks in bellylaughs in makes up for in reliable entertainment value - an increasingly lost art."
m/santa_fe_trail, An enormously interesting movie due to the realism with which it was directed and acted. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/santa_sangre," Santa Sangre is as familiarly esoteric as Jodorowsky's other efforts, but it possesses very pronounced influences."
m/santas_apprentice," Good hearted, well meaning and innocuous, Santa's Apprentice also has a couple of messages, one involving the bully and his need for parental love as a way to correct the nasty behaviour"
m/santoalla_2017, Andrew Becker and Daniel Mehrer get close to their subjects only to retreat when things get truly dangerous.
m/saphead," Buster Keaton's first feature, though charming and lightly amusing, is something of a disappointment"
m/saraband," Ingmar Bergman has said that Saraband, his bleak made-for- television epilogue to Scenes From a Marriage, will be his final statement on film. For the great Swedish writer and director, final turns out to mean unbendingly severe."
m/sarafina, A rather bloody musical that captures the horror that was apartheid.
m/sarah_landon_and_the_paranormal_hour," The filmmaking is borderline incompetent -- the acting varies from okay to awful, the cinematography is unpleasantly soft and the tone is badly misjudged."
m/sarah_silverman_a_speck_of_dust," While it's not surprising that A Speck of Dust is so good - Silverman is a great joke writer and one of the all-time joke tellers, particularly skilled at pacing and performing her sets - it is that much more impressive."
m/sarah_silverman_jesus_is_magic," ...unless one is already a follower of Silverman's work, Jesus is Magic isn't going to come off as anything other than a very long 72 minutes."
m/sarah_silverman_we_are_miracles," The inimitable stamp of Silverman's dark, tart personality is again on rich display in her latest stand-up comedy offering."
m/sarahs_key, What makes Sarah's Key work so powerfully is the way the two strands build upon each other to become greater than the sum of the two parts.
m/sassy_pants," Sweet and well-intentioned, Sassy Pants is difficult to dislike, despite its missteps."
m/satan_hates_you, Satan Hates You is a clever collision of flamboyant gore and social commentary that never goes too far with anything save mordant wit.
m/satanic_panic_2019," ...it wants to be a sleepover movie for adolescent girls and boys...all the parts may be there, but Satanic Panic has no soul."
m/satans_playground," At the end of the day, Satan's Playground let me down, a fact that I attribute primarily to the bad acting, nonsensical storyline, and lack of an appearance by the monster."
m/saturday_church, Saturday Church is a racially and sexually diverse rumination on identity that defies simple definition in its low-key elegance.
m/saturday_night_and_sunday_morning," Finney gives a magnetic performance here, making Arthur both loathsome but somewhat lovable (not unlike Michael Caine's Alfie a few years later)"
m/saturday_night_fever," There's a lot in the movie that's sad and painful, but after a few years what you remember is John Travolta on the dance floor in that classic white disco suit, and the Bee Gees on the soundtrack."
m/saturn_3," Surprisingly entertaining sci-fi flick, but not really good."
m/sausage_party," There is nothing redeemable about SAUSAGE PARTY, other than how hard it made me laugh."
m/savage_dog," It's another bruiser from Adkins, who does what he can with a movie that's not particularly attentive to detail or drama."
m/savage_grace," Told with a spare style and a tart wit, it records sprawling events with a claustrophobic sense of intimacy."
m/savage_sam," The outcome is predictable, but unexplainable is all the levity and high jinks."
m/savages," Director Tamara Jenkins focuses on the largely unexplored relationship between brothers and sisters, and she does so beautifully, thanks to the extraordinary talents of Hoffman and Linney."
m/savages_2012, The disreputable Oliver Stone of old makes a largely welcome reappearance.
m/savannah_2013," A bit on the bland side, but as a +, Jim Caviezel cracks his first on-screen smile in over a decade."
m/save_me_2008," With a sensitive, intelligent screenplay and extremely honest performances, this drama goes far beyond its issue-of-the-week premise."
m/save_the_date_2012," Despite a strong comedic cast, the film isn't particularly funny. Save the Date is a typical Sundance romance that doesn't ever set itself apart from its brethren."
m/save_the_last_dance," As a film, it's no great shakes, and except for the reverse racism subplot, it's been there done that."
m/save_the_tiger, A compelling drama about morality under fire in the life of a middle-aged business man
m/saved, Successfully manages the tricky balancing act of being sharply satirical without making fun of its characters.
m/saving-shiloh," Two major issues here: The boy, Marty (Jason Dolley), is a patronizing do-gooder, and the dog, a beagle-looking fella, doesn't do much that's special."
m/saving_capitalism," America, what went wrong -- from a guy who should know."
m/saving_face, Thought provoking and brimming with charm... with an infectious sense of humor and outstanding performances.
m/saving_grace_b_jones_2011," The film packs in more characters, subplots, and moments of nostalgic detail than it can gracefully accommodate, and the pacing often feels rushed."
m/saving_mr_banks_2013," Lee Hancock has provided a worthy homage to Mary Poppins, in a picture that, though somewhat fluffy, is exactly what'd you hope such a film to be."
m/saving_private_ryan," The remaining battle scenes are riveting, and in war as nowhere else difficult choices can have shattering consequences."
m/saving_santa," Voiced by a recognisable cast, Saving Santa is a pleasant and well-timed festive animation, but its unsophisticated storyline, general lack of humour and substandard soundtrack ultimately let it down."
m/saving_silverman," A poor imitation of some much better movies, desperately longing to be Woody Allen while ending up as Adam Sandler."
m/saving_zoe, Competent but stolid mystery thriller whose ladies/siblings -- the Marano sisters -- can't lift into something moving or special.
m/saw," If Whannell's script doesn't get all the talky parts quite right, he certainly nails the mechanics of telling the story: what to reveal, when to reveal it, and so on."
m/saw3d," What SAW VII doesn't have: a decent plot, characters you care about and an ounce of credulity. This is so over-the-top and convoluted it's goofy."
m/saw_3," ...if ever there was a movie that warranted a ""not for the squeamish"" advisory, this is certainly it."
m/saw_4," With Saw IV, the pieces have all come together and [it's] the best of the lot."
m/saw_VI, Who knew that the franchise's creators would eventually find a plot twist that made sense?
m/saw_ii," While it's far from perfect, this ""bigger, faster, more"" take on the now-familiar Jigsaw killer scenario improves on most of the mistakes of the original."
m/saw_v, It's not a good sign when watching someone stick their hand into a table saw is easier than listening to them recite dialogue.
m/sawdust_and_tinsel," Vsually it is a treat, with Bergman's richly baroque compositions and persistent use of deep focus brilliantly exploiting the circus and theatre settings. And the performances are first-rate."
m/say_anything," A movie like this is possible because its maker believes in the young characters, and in doing the right thing, and in staying true to oneself."
m/say_her_name_the_life_and_death_of_sandra_bland," ""Say Her Name"" navigates a steady path between haters on one side and conspiracy nuts on the other; it's an angry movie that uses its inside voice."
m/say_it_isnt_so," A one-joke short padded with lame misunderstandings, malevolent subterfuge and absurd coincidences that annoy rather than amuse."
m/say_uncle," [Peter] Paige has created an engaging and insightful entertainment with considerably more substance than most small-budget, independent gay films."
m/scaffolding_2018," A fully absorbing character study of who the system is most likely to fail when promise is stoked, but not followed through on."
m/scalene," While occasionally unpleasant, the film never crosses the line from bearably chilling to unbearably gruesome, keeping its characters credible and its events explicable."
m/scalphunters," While the individual incidents are familiar, they are played with gusto by Lancaster and Davis."
m/scandal_in_paris," With a display of suave images and wry performances, Sirk delights in the elegant formalities that withhold judgment in favor of pleasure and knowledge."
m/scanner_darkly," Scene after scene of verbose fiddle-faddle: Characters orate at each other, while sitting in cars, sitting at dining tables, sitting in living rooms, sitting at office desks. The film might be better titled The Big Sit."
m/scarborough," ""Scaborough"" doesn't try to shock audiences, but its attempt at a surprise is sadly predictable."
m/scarecrows," ... [I]f you're looking for a killer horror rental, you'd be hard-pressed to beat it."
m/scared_to_death," A pale affair, made tolerable by Bela Lugosi's droll one-liners."
m/scarface," Watching some 20 years down the line, [Pacino's performance is] laughably campy in a manner that the rest of this bloated, self-important film doesn't seem to appreciate."
m/scarlet_diva," Asia authors herself as Anna Battista, an Italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy."
m/scarlet_street, Lesser known perhaps but no less accomplished than some of [Lang's] more famous works.
m/scarred_hearts," Despite its density, the film has a surprising humor and vitality. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/scars_of_dracula, A rattling collection of warmed-over ideas filmed on a paltry budget...doesn't do anything that Dracula and Prince of Darkness didn't already do better.
m/scary_movie," When it comes to pushing the envelope in comedy, the Farrelly brothers have nothing on those badass Wayans."
m/scary_movie_2," All in all, the movie was pretty funny and entertaining, but really stupid and vulgar."
m/scary_movie_3," The Scary Movie horror spoofs must be some kind of mutant, alien movie franchise. There's just no other explanation for the fact that the sequels actually keep getting better."
m/scary_movie_4," By keeping the parody and humour so tightly focussed, they've generated more laughter than any other filmmaker this year."
m/scary_movie_5, It says a lot about the film that the only half-laughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan.
m/scary_stories," The documentary is a fun nostalgia trip, even if it doesn't provide much depth."
m/scary_stories_to_tell_in_the_dark, The drama often feels a bit stale but 'Scary Stories' makes up for it with exceptional scare sequences.
m/scatter_my_ashes_at_bergdorfs," Granted, not every documentary is necessarily required to dig up dirt and say awful things, but the overbearing gush gets tiresome."
m/scenes_from_a_mall," Some funny moments, but it should have been a triumph"
m/scenes_from_a_marriage, Bergman's screenplay leaves nothing to the imagination and turns the film into a windy soap opera most of the time; what might have been a masterpiece in the TV original (although I doubt it) becomes in its truncated form mostly elegant mush.
m/scenic_route, As the guys' circumstances become more dire ... Scenic Route gets increasingly dopey and contrived. And the movie's cheesily ambiguous ending ... doesn't help.
m/scheme_birds," This extraordinary documentary weighs the bleak details - and they are, at times, almost unbearably grim - against moments of lyrical beauty and even humour."
m/schindlers_list," What is most memorable is not the tragedy of the lives lost or even the number of people Schindler saved, but how such an imperfect man could have done something so perfect"
m/schizopolis, Who knew that deep inside the soul of Steven Soderbergh beat the heart of a great comic actor?
m/schlock, The humor is honest; it's not superimposed to hide weakness.
m/schneider_vs_bax," After a mostly quiet film, tension kicks into high gear in the third act, but it ultimately raises more questions than it answers."
m/school_daze," ambitious, messy, rowdy comedy-drama, which tosses together fraternity foolishness, campus activism, lusty romance and even a few musical numbers"
m/school_for_scoundrels," I'm not sure that Jon Heder is a strong enough leading man, especially for this kind of material."
m/school_life_2020," It feels realistic, well acted, and it captures the rhythms of daily life."
m/school_of_rock, Linklater and his actors understand passion. They understand enthusiasm.
m/school_ties," Still, tempting as it is to giggle at the retro-high-mindedness of School Ties, the movie is nicely acted, and it has been made with some honesty and intelligence."
m/schultze_gets_the_blues," Minimalist but not austere, brimming with compassion but devoid of schmaltz."
m/scoob," Not so much a continuation of the stories audiences have seen, but a soft-reboot that opens the door for an entire Hanna-Barbera universe of adventures, Scoob! is a fun tale of loving friendship ..."
m/scooby_doo_2_monsters_unleashed," The energy and playfulness keep us entertained, but the few real laughs come from either references to the original show or wink-wink movie in-jokes."
m/scoobydoo_and_the_cyber_chase," The gang's trapped in a video game; peril, cartoon violence."
m/scoobydoo_and_the_reluctant_werewolf, Typical Scooby tale has lots of jokes and cartoon jeopardy.
m/scoobydoo_and_the_witchs_ghost," Tecnicamente acima da mdia, conta com boas msicas e um roteiro divertido que ainda nos surpreende com algumas brincadeiras que subvertem velhas tradies da srie."
m/scoop," Fluffy is the intended tone of Scoop, but its willful insignificance also makes it flat."
m/scorched_earth, The result is a film that plainly falls short of its goals.
m/score_a_film_music_documentary," Easy to simply embrace Score as a jukebox of some of the greatest musical moments in film history, enjoying the sweeping musical moments as they play out against dozens of classic films."
m/scorpion_king," [It] not only lacks imagination, it lacks a story, a script, acting, a good villain, lush production values appropriate to a hopeful franchise, and memorable music."
m/scotch_a_golden_dream, A compelling exploration of the multimillion-pound industry.
m/scott-walker-30-century-man," There might be genuine Walker fans who wish to see their forgotten hero given his due, but those who have not acquired that strange taste will find the film hard to take unless it is viewed as a dead-on parody."
m/scott_pilgrims_vs_the_world, A fizzy blast that may not offer many lasting rewards but certainly generates an impressive headlong rush along the way.
m/scout, It's been a long time since there's been a good baseball movie. The Scout makes you wonder if there's ever going to be one again.
m/scouts_guide_to_the_zombie_apocalypse," It's the overall fatigue and predictability of ""Scouts Guide"" that ultimately weighs it down, refusing to let 'er rip with a concept that invites sustained mayhem and sharper jokes."
m/scratch_2002," An energizing, intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching (or turntablism) in particular."
m/scream-4," It's a tired, overstuffed, overlong picture that labors to revitalize a comatose concept. The scream has effectively become a yawn."
m/scream_2, There's enough ingenuity and scariness to please plenty of fans of the first film.
m/scream_3," Scream 3 has arrived, and to say it was well worth the wait would be an understatement."
m/scream_blacula_scream," Blacula becomes something of a slave-master, even as he disdains humans who exploit other humans. 'You made a slave of your sister, and you're still slaves, imitating your slave masters!' he lectures a pair of pimps before tossing them through a window."
m/scream_queen_my_nightmare_on_elm_street," It is a tight, straightforward documentary about one corner of the horror world that has been under appreciated for so long, and it is a love letter to those who have always loved it."
m/screened_out, Cursory and one-sided...but it lays out the parameters of the problem... that these successful cell phone app businesses manipulate in ways that are insidious and destructive to society.
m/screwball," Covers the doping scandal without fear or favor, interested in the kinds of bit players behind the headlines whose stories are often way more interesting than the athletes that have fallen from grace."
m/screwed_2012, Screwed may be based on the true-life experiences of former prison guard Ronnie Thompson but it seems to serve up every available clich from the handbook of tough nut British prison dramas.
m/scrooged," It was obviously intended as a comedy, but there is little comic about it, and indeed the movie's overriding emotions seem to be pain and anger."
m/scumrock, Moritsugu's ending pulls his two major story lines to a surprisingly poignant close.
m/sea_fever_2020, Sea Fever certainly has the potential to be the next great genre hybrid classic.
m/sea_fog," In any case, ""Haemoo"" is a picture worth seeing for its thrills, scrupulous tension-building and mischievous genre twists that will have you gasping one second, and laughing the next."
m/sea_inside," Bardem, who somehow managed to win Venice's Best Actor trophy, does nothing but sit in a bed and ball up his little fists. Very disappointing."
m/sea_of_grass," At 131 minutes, this sprawling western was long on talk and short on action."
m/sea_of_love, Price and director Harold Becker build in enough jumps and scares and good red herrings to be satisfying ...
m/seabiscuit," Seabiscuit aims to be a crowd pleaser, and for the most part it is."
m/seagulls_laughter, Exhibits a sense of life's tragic confines alternating with mischievous wit.
m/seahorse_the_dad_who_gave_birth_2019, For Finlay... allowing McConnell to use his own words makes sense of a complicated process fraught with contradictions and paradoxes even for those not contending with a total destabilization of their personhood.
m/seal_team_6_the_raid_on_osama_bin_laden, Demonstrates with its narrative lassitude and overall dullness just how much Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal did right.
m/search_party, The stag humour is crude and boorish and even the slapstick is very clumsily executed.
m/searchers, The final shot of this genuine epic says everything the Western ever had to say about the price of the American frontier and those forgotten bones upon which a nation was built.
m/searching_2018," Search is shockingly effective, not just in creating a sense of constant, palpable tension, but also in the way it pulls off authentic, effective emotional beats."
m/searching_for_bobby_fischer," Based on a true story, Searching for Bobby Fischer is a wonderful movie, a delicate and touching drama that takes us deep inside the eccentric competitive mystique of grandmaster chess."
m/searching_for_sugar_man, A born crowd-pleaser whose central mystery begets a great triumph of grace and modesty.
m/seasons_2016," The film's strong point is the unquestionable beauty of the imagery, filmed over a four-year period in the national parks and animal reserves of Poland, Romania, Norway, Holland and Scotland."
m/sebastiane," Derek Jarman looks at Sebastian and sees what Botticelli (and Perugino, Reni and Mishima) saw, the lambent space between spiritual and sexual longing"
m/second_act_2018," As for J-Lo herself, she tries gamely, but saddled with one of the worst scripts of the year, this definitely feels closer to her work in Maid in Manhattan than Out of Sight."
m/second_coming_2014," The main body of the movie is a slow, repetitious study of the family's daily life ..."
m/second_opinion_laetrile_at_sloan_kettering," Like many docs with activist undertones, Second Opinion tells a potentially interesting story in a bland way - a fixed camera on its main subject, who recounts the story detail by detail."
m/secondhand_lions," While this unabashedly sweet and sentimental tale is everything I was afraid it would be, I could not help but be affected by it, largely due to Duvall's perfectly pitched performance"
m/seconds, I recommend it -- despite its dated quality and production techniques -- for the wonderful cinematography and an excellent performance by Rock Hudson.
m/secrecy," A sharply produced, thought-provoking documentary that makes compelling arguments on both sides."
m/secret_ballot," Though the film is static, its writer-director's heart is in the right place, his plea for democracy and civic action laudable."
m/secret_honor, Rarely have I seen ninety more compelling minutes on the screen.
m/secret_in_their_eyes," S espero que Campanella no nos obrigue a esperar outros longos cinco anos at seu prximo trabalho, j que suas parcerias com Ricardo Darn so verdadeiros presentes para os fs de um Cinema adulto, profundo e envolvente."
m/secret_in_their_eyes_2015," Billy Ray's story about obsession, passion and justice is buoyed by three superb performances and a tense undercurrent that never lets up"
m/secret_life_of_bees," Like a mouthful of honey, The Secret Life of Bees is cloyingly sweet and gooey, and you're not quite sure you can swallow it undiluted."
m/secret_life_of_daltry_calhoun," Daltry Calhoun proves to be as slight as a blade of grass-and, unfortunately, about as intoxicating as the legal kind."
m/secret_life_of_walter_mitty," Based on the story by James Thurber, adapters Ken Englund and Everett Freeman attempt to include too much, throwing off the pacing."
m/secret_obsession_2019," Secret Obsession does pretty much exactly what you expect it to, and presumably what you want it to, if you watched the brief preview clip while browsing Netflix and then decided that, yes, you would like to hit play."
m/secret_of_moonacre," Whilst missing a trick in terms of script and casting, at least they've amped up the action from the somewhat sedate book."
m/secret_of_nimh, It remains the best entry in Bluth's hugely inconsistent filmography.
m/secret_of_the_wings," Even if parents may be stung by the narrative logic, ""Secret of the Wings"" is still a wonderful sensory experience to share with your child."
m/secret_things," Tawdry, derailed, intellectualized melodrama -- the desperately French equivalent of an early-'90s, straight-to-vid Joan Severance title..."
m/secret_window, Who knew that a story about plagiarism would be so genuinely frightening?
m/secretariat, A wonderful family film about the greatest race horse who ever lived that gets out of the gate quickly and impresses with its big heart and idiosyncratic characters.
m/secretary, What keeps the movie going is the riotously funny and supremely self-controlled performance by Gyllenhaal.
m/secuestro_express," As social commentary, Secuestro Express doesn't go much further than regurgitating character types (poor little rich girl, thief with heart of gold) and reminding us of Caracas's class differences."
m/seducing_charlie_barker," Everything about this movie feels right, from its sardonic score to its assured camera work and cutting."
m/see_no_evil_hear_no_evil," These are ingratiating performers, even when working far below their peak. Watching them, you find yourself wanting to laugh even when the laughs are undeserved."
m/see_spot_run, The result plays terrifically with an all-ages crowd.
m/see_you_in_the_morning," The screenplay is so scrupulous, so fair, so enlightened and so intelligent that real people have trouble shouldering it aside so that they can share messy human emotions. Nothing is ever quite this neat."
m/see_you_in_valhalla_2015," Steve Howey, as a stoner-sage gay Hawaiian personal trainer, almost makes this worth watching all by himself."
m/see_you_next_tuesday," The film is uproariously funny, but its laughs don't come with an aftertaste of cynicism so much as they are the aftertaste of cynicism."
m/see_you_soon, You'll be unlikely to hear the dialogue over the guffawing of the audience.
m/see_you_yesterday, See You Yesterday is an instant sci-fi classic that's as timely as it is terrific.
m/seed_of_chucky," Mancini should've been the man to hit this sequel out of the park...all the filmmaker is capable of is creating the worst, most deliberately unfunny Chucky feature film yet."
m/seed_the_untold_story, gives and effective case that we are losing control of food production around the world.
m/seeds_2019," It is not a shocking film, nor a particularly immoral one. It is just, sadly, a boring one."
m/seeds_of_time, First-person accounts from individuals most affected by the drop in agricultural productivity are rarely the focus of the film's vision.
m/seeing_allred," Leaves a lot of questions unasked and tiptoes around plenty of other relevant conversations, but in its presentation of a career-in-full, it advocates persuasively for this advocate."
m/seeker_the_dark_is_rising," Remember hearing that the early studio inclination with Harry [Potter] was to Americanize him? This tedious, plodding, thoroughly unmagical movie could well be what that Hollywood Harry might have been."
m/seeking_a_friend_for_the_end_of_the_world, The movie's potential for depth ends long before the world does.
m/seems_like_old_times, Miss Hawn is as sweetly zany as ever. She has clearly established herself as the most delightful comedienne now working in movies ...
m/self-medicated," If Brightway's main contribution to Lapica's life was to convince him to take up filmmaking, they deserved to be shut down by the government."
m/selfless_2015," You're better off seeking out Seconds - or heck, All of Me - instead."
m/selma," Intelligently written, vividly shot, tightly edited, sharply acted, the film represents a rare example of craftsmanship working to produce a deeply moving piece of history."
m/sembene_2015, A superb introduction to the career of the father of African cinema as well as a commentary on the problems of postcolonial Africa.
m/semi_pro," If you liked Will Ferrell's previous comedies, you may like his new vehicle, which is poorly directed but recycles elements of the formula, now set in the swinging 1970s, conveyed through tacky fashion and especially bad hair."
m/semitough," Semi-Tough pokes fun in rambling fashion, but it is vulgar in intelligent ways and almost always amusing in its perceptions of befuddled people who are perfectly healthy but often convinced they're not."
m/semper_fi_2019," Courtney and Wolff are acting their asses off in this movie, but hardly anyone is helping them."
m/semper_fi_always_faithful, Riveting. More than worth an investment of time and money on the part of both military personnel and civilians. One of the five best documentaries of 2011.
m/send_me_no_flowers, Jewison's cockeyed comedy works its romantic magic with the flighty entanglement of the Hudson-Day charming kooky connection
m/senior_love_triangle," It's a sharp-eyed character-driven film, whose characters are both lovable and absurd, which makes for an unusual film."
m/senna," Within the expertly edited archival construct, Kapadia maintains a respectful but less-than-adulatory view of Senna himself, and a caustic assessment of Formula One and its then-president Jean-Marie Balestre."
m/sentinel, Michael Douglas might have been hired for the star power he could bring for a good opening weekend [but] it's . . . Kiefer Sutherland who walks off with the film
m/seom-the-isle, Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an (emotionally at least) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested.
m/seoul_station," Like all the best horror films, the grisly events unfolding onscreen are merely a cypher through which the filmmaker can address prominent social issues."
m/separate_lies," An intimate marriage melodrama in the tasteful tradition of Merchant-Ivory Masterpiece Theater, with a touch of Pinter (Betrayal) and Joseph Losey (Accident) thrown in"
m/september_1987," Allen has made so many comedies that it is easy to insist that he make nothing else. Actually, he is as acute an author of serious dialogue as anyone now making movies, and in September most of the real action goes on in the word choices."
m/september_dawn, Forget Grindhouse. September Dawn is the year's first honest-to-goodness exploitation flick.
m/september_issue, It is complemented by the kind of candour makers of documentaries dream about.
m/september_tapes, A true original: a hybrid documentary-staged drama putting an American actor in war-torn Afghanistan.
m/septic_man_2014," Septic Man is sadistically dull, and it will never be met with the cult love it so clearly longs for. It's a loose turd of a film that's best flushed back down the toilet it crawled out of."
m/septien, I must be really getting into the festival circuit because now I'm totally open to a movie like Septien.
m/seraphim_falls," Aside from spasms of brutal violence, however, there's nothing rousing or new here."
m/seraphine," Yolande Moreau captures both the purposeful, single-minded woman who does other people's laundry to support her painting, and Séraphine de Senlis, whose secret life of fervid creativity drove her to madness."
m/serbis," Filipino director Brillante Mendoza fails to disguise his prurient exploitation film, about a family-run soft-core cinema, as art house fare--although he seems to have succeeded in doing so with Cannes and New York film festival programmers."
m/serena_2015," Bier is digging hard for something deep and yet, at the point when you should be reaching for the hankie, it's only because of so much sweaty desperation."
m/serendipity," This fluffy piece is entirely predictable, with small touches of humor and romance, but might also be exactly what certain couples are looking for nowadays."
m/serendipity_2019," Per its title, ""Serendipity"" may allude to the ultimate casting vote of fate, but it also shows the young artist taking what control she can in directing her life, and her potential earthly afterlife too."
m/serenity, Bounces around to sometimes memorable effect but rarely soars.
m/serenity_2019," Serenity is entertaining, indeed laugh-out-loud funny. When it takes a big turn halfway through, its intent is less clear."
m/sergeant_rutledge," Extraordinary Western works at all levels, as rousing story telling, visual beauty and Civil Rights drama."
m/sergeant_york," The first half is quite good, documenting York's rural upbringing with great simplicity and charm. But the second part -- the war -- degenerates quickly and grotesquely."
m/sergio_2020," This portrait of a U.N. peacemaker as a real-life lover and superhero earns points for Wagner Moura's mesmeric portrayal even when it feels too good to be true. Still, in these dark days, advocating for hope and idealism feels exactly right."
m/serial_mom," I never laughed out loud, but I kept a constant grin on my face from ear to ear."
m/serious_moonlight," There's a lot of yelling, cracking wise, and cooing in this creepy rom-com."
m/serpent_and_the_rainbow, [Craven] seems wiser and more story-conscious -- but thankfully still full of the same surprises.
m/serpico," A remarkable record of one man's rebellion against the sort of sleaziness and second-rateness that has affected so much American life, from the ingredients of its hamburgers to the ethics of its civil servants and politicians."
m/servant," Certainly difficult to define, this period piece messes with genres, power relationships and your head."
m/serving_sara," The picture, scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination, is a monument to bad in all its florid variety."
m/sesame_street_presents_follow_that_bird, The series' core values are faithfully reflected in the film.
m/session_9," A rewarding experience with some flaws, but it stands head and shoulders above most of what we see in the genre."
m/set_fire_to_the_stars, A character - and film - overburdened with poetic profundity.
m/set_it_off, The movie surprised and moved me: I expected a routine action picture and was amazed how much I started to care about the characters.
m/set_it_up," A rare romantic comedy that has its own distinctive look, rhythm, and storytelling voice."
m/setup," This is one of the top boxing films ever made, along with Raging Bull and Body and Soul."
m/seve_the_movie," Severiano Ballesteros was one of the least boring golfers in the history of his sport, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from watching Seve ..."
m/seven_beauties," Its virtuoso style, demonstrating once again Miss Wertmuller's mastery of filmmaking, is used to tell us a story that's very opaque, despairing, and bottomless."
m/seven_brides_for_seven_brothers," Accompanying the exhilarating dancing is a fine set of songs, sung with panache, that are memorable for days afterwards."
m/seven_days_in_may, Director John Frankenheimer's 1960s political thriller still crackles and pops.
m/seven_days_in_utopia_2011, A squishy Hallmark Channel-level melodrama that rarely bothers to mask its propagandistic intentions.
m/seven_faces_of_dr_lao," A strange, sporadically entertaining fantasy, which won the Honorary Oscar for Makeup: Tony Randall plays seven roles."
m/seven_girlfriends," Seven Girlfriends is an oh-so-slight but surprisingly entertaining little movie, buoyed by the seemingly effortless charm of Daly."
m/seven_men_from_now, A terrific Western especially for those who take their oaters seriously.
m/seven_pounds," Though the film can ultimately be faulted for pulling its punches...simply having the courage to indulge in some very risky conceits at holiday time, particularly during harsh economic conditions -- merits Smith and his colleagues enormous kudos."
m/seven_psychopaths," 'Seven Psychopaths' is the sort of comedy that will reward repeat viewings, dense with both verbal and visual humor, and smart about the way it deconstructs itself even as it plays."
m/seven_samurai_1956, This movie is so successful because of its flawless direction and very balanced combination of powerful human drama and exciting action.
m/seven_stages_to_achieve_eternal_bliss," This could have resulted in spiky, morbid humor in the Eating Raoul mold, but the writing isn't sharp enough to pull it off."
m/seven_swords," Your enjoyment will be limited by your capacity to watch people try to carve each other up. Some of the plot is a little familiar and borrowed from better films including THE GUNS OF NAVARONE. Still, there is some nearly majestic photography."
m/seven_year_itch, Marilyn Monroe is a temptress in this delightful comedy.
m/seventeen_2019, There is also a certain honesty... which seeps into the problems that the protagonist duo is experiencing. [Full review in Spanish]
m/seventh_seal," This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero."
m/seventh_sign, The Seventh Sign takes the end of the world and turns it into some sort of Revelation-themed escape room.
m/seventh_son," As is often the case in films like this, Seventh Son is at its weakest when it tries to leaven its brink-of-disaster gravity with a little nerdy humor."
m/seventh_victim," the gauziest, maybe the most influential, surely the most underestimated, Lewton production."
m/seventh_voyage_of_sinbad, Childhood memory stuff of the most compelling kind.
m/severance, A motley group of employees from an international weapons company find themselves hilariously at the business end of their own products in Christopher Smith's razor-sharp comedy horror film.
m/severe_clear, A potent reminder of how thankless a soldier's job is.
m/severed_ways," Seems more informed by low-budget History Channel programs and the proto-metal Norse lore of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song."""
m/sex-drugs-rock-roll-2009," Anchored by a ripping central performance from Serkis, this biopic about notorious musician Ian Dury is too stylish for its own good. Director Whitecross shows ambition and audacity, but his riotous visual style is distracting."
m/sex_addict," this badass polysexual freakshow is unlikely to be showing in a multiplex near you, but is the perfect midnight feature."
m/sex_and_breakfast," Despite an attractive cast and a few nice moments, Sex and Breakfast is just not that exciting."
m/sex_and_death_101," Unlike most genre blenders of this sort, there is nothing sophomoric about Sex & Death 101."
m/sex_and_lucia," In this erotic, atmospheric film you'll discover why Europeans like telephone showerheads."
m/sex_and_the_city, One thing's for sure: fans of the series will lap this film up.
m/sex_and_the_city_2," A bloated, wearyingly unsubtle, dramatically inert valentine to conspicuous consumption. The movie's overly demonstrative acting style -- embodied in varying degrees by all four leads -- seems pitched at small children."
m/sex_and_the_single_girl," In a small role as a production man, note Wayne, who appears as Benjamin Franklin in a superb one-man show around the world. Storch also turns in a neat cameo as a motorcycle cop."
m/sex_death_and_bowling, Seems more like a Lifetime Network movie than something designed for theatrical release.
m/sex_doll, The script peels away layers of possibility until it becomes clear that there is almost nothing underneath.
m/sex_drive, An obligatory smattering of gross-out humor and a litany of erotic hopes and fears get ground up in a slapstick approach to an already diminishing genre.
m/sex_drugs_rock_and_roll," A scary overview of the dark side of the male psyche where paranoia, misogyny, and compulsiveness reign."
m/sex_is_comedy, Breillat herself manages to jerk off for 92 long minutes and never comes... she actually seems to fake herself into thinking she's had an artistic orgasm.
m/sex_lies_and_videotape," By all means, an interesting ninety minutes, just not a great ninety."
m/sex_politics_and_cocktails, Less a narrative than a haphazard succession of vignettes populated by crude stereotypes instead of credible characters.
m/sex_positive, Definitely worth seeing...many of us literally owe our lives to (the film's subjects).
m/sex_tape_2014, Intermittently funny but not without a share of forced comedy.
m/sextette," Mae West's swan song to cinema at age 86 is one of the world's all-time worst movies, but that doesn't detract at all from its immense charm and lewd fascination."
m/sextuplets," If there is a solid laugh to be found in ""Sextuplets,"" this viewer missed it."
m/sexy_beast, A wonderfully stylish thriller packed with astoundingly good performances.
m/seymour_an_introduction," Hawke's film is very well crafted, tightly edited and elegantly photographed. The acute musical selections only add to our appreciation of Seymour's selfless devotion to his art."
m/sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band," This isn't a movie, it's a business deal set to music."
m/sgt_bilko," The movie is saturated with stagnant, one-note performances from stagnant, one-note actors."
m/sgt_stubby_an_american_hero," An education-focused and age-appropriate true story of the official mascot of the 102nd infantry regiment, who participated in seventeen battles on the Western Front during World War I, returning home as a hero."
m/sgt_will_gardner, The takeaway message from Sgt. Will Gardner is that American veterans deserve better.
m/shade," Audiences are (or should be) too keen on the con genre for filmmakers to keep expecting wide-eyed reactions on twist after twist, but this is a pretty decent one and outside of Mamet it's not often something you should expect."
m/shadow_2011," presents one of the creepiest, most grotesque-looking antagonists seen since Max Schreck embodied Count Orlock in Nosferatu (1922). And if that does not whet the appetite, there is a scene of gratuitous toad-licking too..."
m/shadow_2018, With action scenes choreographed with Zhang's typical verve and imagination - you'll never again think of your umbrella as just a tool for keeping the rain off - fans of this artistic end of the 'wu xia' genre ought to be delighted.
m/shadow_company," The movie presents a balanced view, showing both the moral challenges and tactical advantages of using professional soldiers."
m/shadow_conspiracy, Is it just me or is Charlie Sheen the kiss of death for anything other than Hot Shots?
m/shadow_dancer_2012," An opaque, slow-burning but brilliant thriller about the compulsions of terrorism, one that avoids ideological bombast and looks instead to the experiences of an angry and frightened woman."
m/shadow_dead_riot," Even if the horror elements don't always score, Shadow remains a non-stop, over-the-top, exploitive hoot."
m/shadow_of_the_vampire," A sloppy mess of a film, really corny, and a lot of fun to watch."
m/shadowboxer," Apparently convinced that the daring material would provide them with an opportunity to give their craft a strenuous workout, Gooding Jr. and Mirren gamely apply themselves but end up looking uncomfortable under Daniels' heavy-handed directorial imprint."
m/shadowlands," Richard Attenborough tackles yet another ""true story"" and this time comes away with something quite a bit more substantial than Robert Downey, Jr. in greasepaint."
m/shadows-of-forgotten-ancestors," Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors is one of those rare films that look totally fresh and uncorrupted -- as if the director hadn't pilfered a thing from other film makers but had simply discovered the camera, and how best to use it, by himself."
m/shadows_and_fog," Leaves you hanging at the end, but it's fun putting your head in the noose."
m/shadows_in_the_sun_2005," Excels in its moody portrayals and intrigue, although confusion with plot points occasionally distracts"
m/shadrach," Shadrach is another one of those well-meaning films, like Amistad, in which slaves are the supporting characters in their own stories."
m/shaft_2019," This latest Shaft never quite figures out how to view its Blaxploitation roots in an era of millennials and political correctness. But at least it has some fun trying...fun dialogue as well as great chemistry between Roundtree, Jackson and Usher."
m/shafts_big_score," The movie is intended as mass-audience escapist entertainment, and works on that level better than Shaft did."
m/shaggy_dog," Watching Tim Allen as a big, floppy sheepdog telling his wife he loves her, is about as funny as it gets."
m/shahid, Mr. Mehta has done something difficult. He has made a film of conviction that's neither plodding nor preachy.
m/shakes_the_clown, Shakes the Clown is sick but whether it's a joke is a matter of taste. And this film is about as tasteless as they come.
m/shakespeare_behind_bars, There's no denying the pic's overall impact as a compelling study of art as a source of transcendence.
m/shakespeare_high," The hardest thing about watching this movie is realizing that some of the kids you come to like so much, and their teams who've worked so hard, are going to lose the competition"
m/shakespeare_in_love," Not even Stoppard is Shakespeare, and the end result resembles one of Neil Simon's middlebrow romps more than it does As You Like It."
m/shakespeare_wallah, Surprisingly light and enjoyable early James Ivory film with luminous Felicity Kendal.
m/shall_we_dance, This G-rated version of Unfaithful suggests middle-aged men and women can have their cake as long as they just rub up against it but don't eat it.
m/shall_we_kiss, Emmanuel Mouret continues his winning streak with Shall We Kiss? another Woody Allen-meets-Eric Rohmer romantic comedy in which the young writer-director again plays the doofus lead.
m/shallow_ground," Os efeitos de maquiagem so timos, mas o roteiro estpido a direo repleta de clichs de Sheldon Wilson s ficam acima das pssimas atuaes de todo o elenco."
m/shallow_hal, The end result isn't so much a blind taste test for the male pig than it is a subversive jab at the fragile male ego and the moral sightline.
m/shame," Shame moves in deep waters: It shows, in the bleakest and most uncompromising terms, that the worst that war has to offer is the wounds it inflicts on the human mind."
m/shame_2011," When you're managed to make being Michael Fassbender and bedding beautiful women nonstop seem like a waking nightmare, you've accomplished something."
m/shampoo," It's rare for a Hollywood film to have a single decent part for a woman: four great ones is unheard of. And all the female leads are spectacular, giving performances on par with the best of their careers."
m/shane," There are intriguing mysteries in Shane, puzzles and challenges, not least in the title character and the way he is played by Alan Ladd."
m/shanghai," The technical achievements of the picture are numerous, making Shanghai painless to watch. It's maintaining interest in the eroding mystery and its passive players that's a significant challenge."
m/shanghai_calling, Light mainstream feature has enough charisma and cultural observations -- but only just
m/shanghai_knights," Propelled by potent chemistry between Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, Shanghai Knights proves that, sometimes, bigger actually can be better."
m/shanghai_noon, A fun little flick that Chan or western buffs should go check out at a matinee.
m/shanghai_surprise," It feels, more than anything, like the duo went looking for a movie they could co-star in, and this was the only script that was lying around."
m/shanghai_triad," Shanghai Triad plays like a movie in which some scenes are missing, and others have been stretched out to make up the difference."
m/shank," Shank boasts some lively direction and has a couple of nice ideas but is ultimately let down by a repetitive script, some poor performances and a dodgy central message."
m/shaolin," Despite out of place comic relief from Jackie Chan, this deftly weaves history and politics, while boasting brilliant martial arts."
m/shaolin_soccer, The movie has something for any Hong Kong cinephile.
m/shark_attack_3_megalodon," [An} apropos motion picture maxim for Shark Attack 3: Megalodon would read ""this time...it's miserable...Or horrible...Or copyright infringeable."""
m/shark_night_3d," The one crime a B-movie should never commit is boring its audience. By even these low standards, ""Shark Night 3D"" is dead in the water."
m/shark_tale," Overfamiliarity extends to the story, jokes and music, most of which reference popular entertainment of about 30 years ago."
m/sharknado_2013," Every so often, something comes along that puts a skip in your step, makes your heart flutter, and sets your imagination ablaze with possibility.... If you're really lucky... it'll be a swirling mass of bloodthirsty sharks."
m/sharknado_2_the_second_one," Usually, follow-ups to goofy films like the first Sharknado suffer because the makers are too conscious of the original. In this case, though, they just don't seem to give a shark."
m/sharknado_3_oh_hell_no," The pun is as fitting as it is inevitable, so let's go ahead and get it out of the way: Sharknado 3 has definitely jumped the shark."
m/sharknado_5_global_swarming," Franchise Fred approves Sharknado 5: Global Swarming. Theatrical movies should have this much fun, and take the absurd this seriously."
m/sharknado_the_4th_awakens," With Sharknado: The 4th Awakens, this B movie series most definitely - wait for it - jumps the shark."
m/sharktopus," perhaps the best response to this essentially critic-proof monstrosity is articulated by the male adolescent tourist who, on seeing the sharktopus graphically attack one of the performers at an open-air show, is heard to declare, ""Dude, that's awesome!"""
m/sharkwater," In its present form, however, the film's merits are compromised by structural and conceptual flaws."
m/sharkys_machine, Would be laughable if not for its intensity of romanticism
m/sharpays_fabulous_adventure," If young viewers thought Sharpay's rich-daddy's-girl antics were fun in High School Musical, seeing her try to make it in NYC will also be a treat."
m/shattered_glass," The pacing is great, the script is witty, and the acting is rock solid."
m/shaun_of_the_dead," British comedy that is actually funny. Not only that, but it's clever, funny, anarchic, funny and refreshing. And it's funny too."
m/shaun_the_sheep_movie," It is sophisticated yet innocent, and while always accessible for young fans it never suffers from a lack of dialogue, with the straightforward and breezy story easy to follow and fun to enjoy."
m/shawshank_redemption," With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages."
m/shazam," If you've been a lifelong Shazam fan, you'll be pleased to see that [the filmmakers] found a way to make this often-neglected DC character fun and even cool at the same time."
m/she_dies_tomorrow," ""She Dies Tomorrow"" is Albert Camus meets David Lynch, a darkly absurdist fable about our fear of mortality and its unsettling capacity to spread."
m/she_done_him_wrong," She Done Him Wrong (1933), from director Lowell Sherman, is Mae West's star-making, most famous film role as a liberated, racy woman"
m/she_gets_what_she_wants," A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional, unlikable characters and hackneyed, threadbare comic setups."
m/she_hate_me," Most contracts are negotiated with John Hancocks, but in She Hate Me, deals are sealed with hot lesbian action."
m/she_wore_a_yellow_ribbon," ...a lot of people's favorite Western, and it's good to see it in all its Technicolor glory on DVD."
m/sheena, A horse painted like a zebra and a flamingo stampede just aren't enough.
m/sheitan," t's pronounced 'Shite-an', as in 'Shite an' then some'."
m/shelley_2016," A classy take on the often trashy pregnancy horror category, with a subtle social critique underlying its neo-gothic texture."
m/sheltering_sky, A disappointingly reductive adaptation of Paul Bowles's first novel.
m/shepard_and_dark," It's actually a fascinating journey, unfolding - just like real life - in ways that are honest and unexpected and not always pleasant."
m/shepherds_and_butchers," Oliver Schmitz, one of South Africa's essential directors, delivers a mix of emotional acuity and overkill with this death penalty drama."
m/sherlock-jr," Not only one of the funniest movies of all time, filled with staggering stunts, amazing sight gags, and mind-boggling cinematic tricks, but it's also a brilliant meditation on the nature of the film medium itself, perhaps the best ever made."
m/sherlock_gnomes," There's some potential for literary humor among the kid-oriented jokes here, but alas, ""Sherlock Gnomes"" doesn't have nearly the wit or charm of the original."
m/sherlock_holmes_2009," Ritchie, Downey Jr and Law have done just about as good a job at reimagining the great sleuth for the modern audiences as one could have hoped."
m/sherlock_holmes_a_game_of_shadows," While director Guy Ritchie's excesses and modern concessions -- among them a lot of explosions -- remain intact, the parts of this second Sherlock Holmes are considerably more rewarding."
m/sherlock_holmes_and_the_woman_in_green, Interesting Rathbone Holmes film with a slightly different approach
m/sherlock_holmes_dressed_to_kill, This is another enjoyable well-paced and acted mystery thriller in the series with the usual pleasant banter between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.
m/sherlock_holmes_in_terror_by_night, In this very short film ... so much comic relief feels like desperate attempts to pad an already skimpy story.
m/sherpa," When nature unexpectedly intervenes, however, Sherpa swiftly proves as grippingly human and political as it does visually spectacular."
m/sherrybaby," Due to the unsympathetic nature of the lead character, it's hard to emotionally invest in the film beyond that feeling of watching yet another Jerry Springer-friendly family adventure."
m/shes_all_that, The rest is just breezy propaganda for American high school fascism.
m/shes_allergic_to_cats," This is a surreal portrait of one man's angst-ridden interior world under the Hollywood sign. Funny, hallucinatory and deliriously strange, Reich's internalised, animalistic trip is literally bananas."
m/shes_funny_that_way," Apart from reminding us of his well-documented affection for Ernst Lubitsch and the Hollywood comedies of the 1940s, [Bogdanovich] doesn't have anything to tell us - even after all this time away from the big screen."
m/shes_gotta_have_it, Fledgling Spike Lee work. More interesting than good
m/shes_having_a_baby," Taking his erstwhile teen lovers into young adulthood, marriage and parenthood, John Hughes fashions a curiously disaffected portrait of the artist as a frustrated chauvinist."
m/shes_just_a_shadow," Whether or not one is seduced by the sensual appeal of it all, it's impossible to deny that this is a cinematic masterpiece."
m/shes_missing, She's Missing has a Lynchian sense of mystery and is a prickly and distinctive portrait of female friendship.
m/shes_out_of_control," She's Out of Control is predictable, silly and contrived, all of which could be forgiven if it were funny enough. It's not."
m/shes_out_of_my_league," The movie is convincing enough to give every Kirk in the world a semblance of hope. Every once in a while, love really is blind."
m/shes_so_lovely," It careens back and forth between slapstick, pathos, and unneccessary violence."
m/shes_the_man," For all my trepidation, a weird thing happened as I watched the movie. Slowly, even craftily, the silly darn thing began to sneak up on me."
m/shes_the_one," She's The One becomes the story of secondary characters, but the film still works because of Burns' unique storytelling."
m/shewolf_of_london," Though the story is lacking in excitement, it at least was competently filmed and has winning sets."
m/shifty," Good central performances in this highly, entertaining character-driven debut."
m/shiloh_2_shiloh_season," When all is said and done, it's just another weak attempt at good family entertainment."
m/shimmer_lake," Almost comical, not-quite suspenseful, right on the cusp of ""Netflixable."""
m/shine," If, at times, Shine's luster reveals more elbow grease than internal radiance, the movie is still a moving tribute to the human capacity to overcome all odds."
m/shine_a_light," Martin Scorsese's Shine a Light, featuring the Rolling Stones onstage with their talented friends, rattled my old bones to nirvana and beyond as I searched for superlatives adequate to describe the rapturous vibes let loose by the performers."
m/shine_of_rainbows," Far from the most convincing source of matinee entertainment, it's pleasing to find something not backed by an aggressive marketing campaign, focused on the plague of modern youth, or weighed down by bathroom humor."
m/shining," Kubrick isn't out for screams, but he manages to make his movie thoroughly unnerving by keeping the horror so close to home."
m/shining_through, Here is a film in which scene after scene is so implausible that the movie kept pushing me outside and making me ask how the key scenes could possibly be taken seriously.
m/shinjuku_incident," It's more social drama than gangster movie, but there is plenty of violence, all of it of a furiously sloppy and savage nature of street thugs."
m/ship_of_fools," As glib as Stanley Kramer often is, there is probably nothing glibber in his entire output than this Abby Mann adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's novel."
m/shipping_news, The fable-telling here is more attuned to character and largely apolitical.
m/shiri2002, A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance.
m/shirin_in_love_2014," A pallid romantic comedy possessed of neither imagination nor heart, it stumbles, like its star, from one familiar setpiece to another with a kind of dutiful, joyless resignation."
m/shirkers," An exemplary work of counter-lives and alternative histories, intimate self-portraiture and cultural reconstruction, hard-won empathy and painful reconciliation."
m/shirley_2020, Josephine Decker is the preeminent director of women who utilize their canny madness in ways that are utterly thrilling.
m/shirley_valentine," think of Shirley Valentine as ""Educating Rita under the Tuscan Sun."""
m/shock_and_awe_2018," Too prone to the use of heavy-handed clichs to register on the prestige awards circuit, this is a film which fails to capture the nervy energy of the news room ..."
m/shock_corridor, Fuller's low-budgeted masterpiece screams for more recognition.
m/shock_doctrine," I'd recommend this most to younger audiences who are starting to take an interest in politics, and would be interested in a crash course on the last 30 years or so, at least from one particular perspective."
m/shock_to_the_system_a_donald_strachey_mystery," Pity there was no room for Phyllis Diller or Carol Channing here, because then the film might have had a leg up on Scooby-Doo and the Creepy Castle."
m/shock_wave, This is a workman-like and heavy-handed effort that is unlikely to knock anyone's socks off.
m/shocker, Um dos piores filmes da carreira de Wes Craven - e perceba que estamos falando do responsvel pelo terrvel Um Vampiro no Brooklyn...
m/shockproof," Given its poetic nuances, it's a shame the film succumbs to cliché."
m/shoes_of_the_fisherman," Unless you have read the novel by Morris West on which the film is based, the first two hours are unintelligible."
m/shoeshine, Shoeshine's tragedy evolves from the overall environment and system as much as it does from the individual choices the boys make.
m/sholem_aleichem_laughing_in_the_darkness_2011, An invigorating and fascinating biographical documentary that should be required viewing for anyone with a love for the written word.
m/shoot_em_up, The biggest problem I have with a spoof of action/ carnage/ car chase/ gunfire movies is that this genre is a spoof of real life to begin with. What's with spoofing a spoof?
m/shoot_the_moon, A racking film which explores divorce with sensitivity and artistic skill.
m/shoot_the_piano_player," Like Charlie only being able to let his real feelings out through that little crate piano, films like this remind us of our love for film and the possibilities within even the most bare and irreverent stories."
m/shoot_to_marry," Shoot to Marry is a heartfelt documentary that is equal parts introspective, quirky, funny, sad and joyful."
m/shooter," Some old dude steals the movie by saying, ""I still have the shovel."""
m/shooting_heroin, Shooting Heroin is a good story and a good movie with the best of intentions.
m/shooting_the_mafia," Roughly two-thirds of the film feels like a self-indulgent memoir, with all the selective memory autobiographies often bring."
m/shootist, Ambiguity takes the bone out of the movie and it collapses.
m/shop_around_the_corner," The Shop Around the Corner is a blueprint for great romantic comedy, perfectly balancing its sentiment with cleverness and humour, and giving us a set of delightful characters in a plot that is as unpredictable as it is original."
m/shopgirl, ...an effective and faithful adaptation of the source material.
m/shoplifters, What it lacks in newness it makes up in raw humanity.
m/short-cut-to-nirvana," Overall tenor amplifies Kumbh Mela's own atmosphere of tolerance, generosity, and earnest spiritual questing."
m/short_circuit_2, Calling Short Circuit 2 a movie is like calling Cool Whip dinner.
m/short_term_12_2013," Larson's performance is something of a quiet revelation, and the same could be said of the film itself."
m/shorts_the_adventures_of_the_wishing_rock," More zippy, diverting fun from Robert Rodriguez's family filmmaking factory."
m/shot_caller, [Waugh and Coster-Waldau] are practically a platonic love connection.
m/shot_the_psycho_spiritual_mantra_of_rock," In the end, it's pretty clear that there was more to Rock than simply having been in the right places at the right time."
m/shotgun_stories, ... a simple human story with the archetypal power of Greek myth. It feels like an American classic.
m/shottas," It's tough to imagine how someone could make a movie about Jamaican gangsterism that's so devoid of political content, but that's hardly Silvestra's biggest problem."
m/shoujyo_an_adolescent," Shoujyo: An Adolescent seems to be several movies at once: a hard-boiled detective story, a Lolita-style intergenerational romance and a family psychodrama complete with pat Freudian flashbacks."
m/shout_at_the_devil," Shout at the Devil is a big, dumb, silly movie that's impossible to dislike. It's so cheerfully corny, so willing to involve its heroes in every possible predicament, that after awhile we relax."
m/show_dogs," A panting, poorly trained entry in the live-action/talking animal genre that for once makes viewers long for the candy-colored, half-witted professionalism of third-tier Pixar-knockoff animation."
m/showdown_in_little_tokyo_1998, Fun B-grade martial arts movie. Lee has some great lines.
m/showdown_in_manila," Pedestrian (at best) in content and execution, including listless, sometimes inept staging of key action elements."
m/showgirls, An overcoat movie for men who don't want to be seen going into a porno theater.
m/showrunners_the_art_of_running_a_tv_show, Showrunners...would make a good fit in the WGA showrunner training program glimpsed throughout the film.
m/shrek," Smart, sassy and chockablock with witty references to pop culture past and present."
m/shrek_2," The film is amusing from start to finish, but one pseudo-video-taped segment of ""KNIGHTS"" (a ""COPS"" spoof) rocks the theater. It's hands down (or handcuffed) hilarious."
m/shrek_3," Fiona's reactive complexity gives her a personality that makes you want to put your arms around her and hug. (Doing that to her voice actress will do just fine, as well.)"
m/shrek_forever_after, The first summer movie thus far to deliver on its promise to put on a good show.
m/shrooms," Fans of the horror genre will appreciate the ""leftover"" stuff because it's presented in a relatively fresh package, but leftovers they remain..."
m/shut_in," This is a disappointing waste of good acting talent, coupled with a very pedantic and not very intriguing story from first-time screenwriter Christina Hodson."
m/shut_up_and_play_the_hits," Much like the band's self-conscious synth-pop itself, Shut Up is initially satiric but ultimately disarming in its emotional resonance."
m/shut_up_little_man," Documenting both an outrageously funny-tragic story and a surprising pop-culture phenomenon, this film not only has a hugely entertaining narrative, but it also astutely explores issues of voyeurism and exploitation."
m/shutter," Don't let the over-familiar nature of the plot fool you. This Asian horror thriller rises above its flaws to deliver a tightly constructed, affecting, and downright terrifying ride."
m/siam_sunset," Roache ... has no trouble covering the complexity of Perry, while the supporting cast (usually representing the mediocrity and awfulness of the world) are nearly always good for a laugh."
m/siberia_2018," The film has the tone and look of a direct-to-video feature, and some shots of Keanu Reeves are so waxen that the actor almost looks rotoscoped."
m/sicario_2015, A slow building thriller that has a lot to say about the current U.S. led drug war
m/sicario_day_of_the_soldado, Day of the Soldado is so expertly crafted that you can't fully fault its creators for wanting to make the movie slightly more accessible and marketable.
m/sick_the_life_and_death_of_bob_flanagan_supermasochist," There's never quite been a movie like Sick, which isn't interesting enough, alas, to make its repellent and morbid episodes bearable."
m/sicko," An affecting and entertaining dissection of the American health care industry, showing how it benefits the few at the expense of the many."
m/siddharth," For all its scenes of orphans and hardscrabble street life, and its spirit of shrugging helplessness, Siddharth always feels ferociously personal."
m/side_by_side_2012, A wonky gabfest for film buffs ... you're bound to learn something
m/side_effects," The material is all there to be a scathing, timely commentary on the pharmaceutical industry - when presented this way, it's a watered down version of the truth."
m/side_effects_2013, Explores interesting ideas within the world of psychiatry and pharmaceuticals by transplanting them into a classic thriller setting.
m/sidekick," Even though I have read a comic or two in my life, it's not just for us nerds....It's a universal story. Honest."
m/sidewalk_stories," Lane is endlessly inventive in the ways he finds to create humorous situations and tell his story through images, and the soundtrack music, by Marc Marder, reinforces everything that happens."
m/sidewalls_2011," Smart, wordy and sweetly sympathetic to lives lived online, ""Sidewalls"" coasts on Martín and Mariana's twin voice-overs, alternate musings on themselves and their city."
m/sideways," Finds the absolute perfect note to end on, stripping away all the double-talk and simply finding a way to just open up and enjoy every ounce of flavor that life offers."
m/sierra_burgess_is_a_loser," And so even if you've seen it all before, Sierra Burgess will still satisfy your end-of-summer sweet tooth."
m/sightseers, Lowe and Oram's script balances nimbly on the thread of razor wire between horror and farce...
m/signal, The Signal is a moderately subversive and very proficient splatter horror movie of the sort David Cronenberg used to make back in the '70s and '80s.
m/signs, Shyamalan definitely keeps his title as the master of suspense with Signs. He's able to take the simplest everyday things and scare the crap out of you with them.
m/sikandar, Sikandar does the one thing unforgivable for a film concerned with ethical accounting: absolve the hero of ultimate responsibility for his actions.
m/silence_2013," Closer to Abbas Kiarostami (Like Someone In Love) than Berberian Sound Studio, it's a lyrical if emotionally muted journey."
m/silence_2017," Whatever your faith, this battle is provocative drama philosophically. If oppressors are demanding you renounce your faith, do you go along with it to save lives, not only yours but hundreds or thousands of others? Or do you die for your beliefs?"
m/silence_of_the_lambs," A smart, restrained entertainment, it doesn't splash around in blood and hysteria."
m/silent_fall," Silent Fall, a dramatically repressed psychodrama, could be sued for creative malpractice."
m/silent_hill," Not much more than a ""haunted town"" thrill-ride, with only a few plot points tossed in to keep things moving, Silent Hill truly is a feast for the eyes -- provided your eyeballs aren't too squeamish."
m/silent_hill_revelation," It's never a good sign when the trailers playing before a film have richer, more complete narratives than the feature you've paid to see."
m/silent_house_2012, The cleverly and handsomely achieved gimmick compensates for troublesome motivation and suspension of disbelief issues to make this a genuinely fresh treat for horror fans.
m/silent_light," To mention Carlos Reygadas' winsome Silent Light in the same breath as key directors Carl Theodor Dreyer, Andrei Tarkovsky, Robert Bresson, and the more recent Bruno Dumont is not hyperbole."
m/silent_night_2010," This brisk reimagining of the 1984 slasher ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" delivers the seasonal goods with admirable efficiency and not a little wit."
m/silent_running," Songs from Joan Baez borders on chalkboard-grating, to the point where I had to simply shut the DVD off during the closing credits."
m/silent_souls," At 75 minutes, Silent Souls has the sustained flow of a musical composition."
m/silent_tongue," It's obvious that Shepard has a certain love for his subject, and he has made a compelling film. Like a good yarn, it is strengthened by over-the-top acting from Bates and Phoenix."
m/silver_chalice," Though it is lavish and sweeping in execution, The Silver Chalice, for all of its august and religious aspects, is not an imposing offering."
m/silver_city," A hit-and-miss affair, commendable for its intricate, unpredictable storytelling but frustrating that it all adds up to a poof of smoke and a wink at the viewer."
m/silver_linings_playbook," With great pacing, a great sense of the moment and some of the most entertaining one-liners you'll find this side of a Coen brothers' film, there's much to like about Silver Linings Playbook."
m/silverado," By the time the credits roll, we’ve had a whirlwind tour of virtually everything you can do in a Western."
m/simian_line," You might think Weehawken is the epitome of dorkdom after the chimpanzee-less Line makes you choke on its old-fashioned, spiritless dust."
m/simon_and_the_oaks_2012, Simon and the Oaks has all the superficial elements of compelling drama but none of the interiority; it looks like a good movie without ever actually feeling like one.
m/simon_birch, Simon Birch packs the dramatic impact of a mayonnaise sandwich on white bread.
m/simon_killer," A disturbing, complicated portrait of a young sociopath lost in Paris."
m/simon_sez," Me, I'll stick to appreciating Worm Rodman in his true and natural element: the 96-foot hardwood floor."
m/simone_2002," Niccol doesn't just make his point about the death of authenticity in today's Hollywood, he hammers it home until the movie collapses."
m/simpatico," Improbabilities and all, Simpatico still boasts wonderful scenes and a cast that is truly superb."
m/simple_men," This original film features extreme factions of America: Bill (Robert Burke) is a robber-mechanic, an amalgam betweenn 1980s Reagonomics overachiever and a thug, and Dennis (William Sage), a scientist-philosopher."
m/simple_plan," I don't ask much from a movie, really: Give me three discontented guys and a big sack of money, then let it all slowly unravel, and I'm happy."
m/simple_twist_of_fate," This is not at all a bad movie, mind you, but a good movie gone wrong, through a simple twist of miscalculation."
m/simply_irresistible, Scrambles many of what were among the winning elements of You've Got Mail--but audiences are returning this one to sender.
m/simpsons_movie," Clever, cutting and irrepressible, The Simpsons Movie hits the big screen with all the humour and panache we have come to expect from the series"
m/sin_alas," Director Ben Chace's drama offers a sensual, brainy immersion in scenes of Cuban life past and present."
m/sin_city," Be prepared to shut your eyes through some of it, but the rest of it is a wild ride."
m/sin_noticias_de_dios," An unfocused, overplotted, painfully derivative comic fantasy."
m/sinbad_and_the_eye_of_the_tiger, One of those great Harrhausen adventure epics that you simply have to catch while you're still 14.
m/sinbad_legend_of_the_seven_seas," Sinbad is harmlessly inoffensive enough to be enjoyed by the kind of pre-teen kids who love a good swashbuckling adventure full of all those cartoon cliches, but anyone hoping for more will have to set sail on another adventure."
m/sing_2016, When the big show finally happens at the end of the picture? You can't help but smile.
m/sing_street, Sing Street is guaranteed to get you out of your seat and dancing in the streets.
m/sing_your_song," Sing Your Song does three things only a superior bio-doc can do: Tell a stirring life story, place that life in the context of its times, and portray it with the kind of depth and breadth that makes you wonder why it hasn't been told before."
m/singin_in_the_rain, Very likely the greatest musical MGM or anyone else ever produced.
m/singing_detective," ...unless you're intimately familiar with either the book or seven-hour British mini-series that came before it, the film's not going to mean much to you."
m/single_white_female," This is a story which, in other hands, could have simply been an all-female slasher movie, but Barbet Schroeder, who produced and directed it, has a mordant humor that pushes the material over the top. It is a slasher movie, and a little more."
m/sinister_2," Anyone who found the original a cut above the average horror pic will likely leave the theater disappointed, if not downright insulted."
m/sinister_2012, 'Sinister' is so incredibly stupid. But it IS SCARY. The best way to describe it is '8MM' meets 'Paranormal Activity.'
m/sint," Has a cockeyed charm, some truly clever ideas, and more than enough energy to pull it all off. And it's really gory."
m/siones-wedding," Samoan Wedding is a rowdy, bawdy New Zealand comedy that perceptively depicts the universal with the particular in an amusing, affectionate way."
m/sir_no_sir, Illuminates the past while providing lessons for today's peace movement. An outstanding documentary.
m/siren_2016, For the most part this is a clever and confident expansion of a terrific short. It stings less but packs plenty of poison.
m/sister_act, The trailer has high energy and whammo punchlines. The movie is sort of low-key and contemplative and a little too thoughtful.
m/sister_act_2_back_in_the_habit," Sister Act 2: Back In the Habit is merely a rehash of the first film, with less wit and charm."
m/sister_aimee," I think that it is safe to say that Sister Aimee could easily find an audience similar to that of Little Miss Sunshine, Nurse Betty, or Juno."
m/sister_helen, See the true story of Sister Helen and her band of weary men now.
m/sisterhood_of_the_traveling_pants," This Sisterhood is real pleasure, a big-hearted movie where a group of gifted actresses find opportunities most younger movie stars can only dream about."
m/sisterhood_of_the_traveling_pants_2," With very little sex and very little city, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 still seems a good bet to grab a sizable chunk of the underserved chick-flick demographic."
m/sisters_1973," It's all about technique, and if you like the technique he's using, you'll like the film."
m/sisters_2015," Fey throws herself into the showier role with admirable aplomb, but it's Poehler's quieter, more endearing turn that elevates the film beyond a whole-lotta-crazy."
m/sita_sings_the_blues," An almost indescribable pleasure from Brooklyn-based cartoonist and animator Nina Paley. The film, dazzling and poignant and five years in the making, retells the ancient Indian epic The Ramayana from a gentle but insistent feminist perspective."
m/six_days_seven_nights, It's the kind of movie that provides diversion for the idle channel-surfer but isn't worth a trip to the theater. A lot of it seems cobbled together out of spare parts.
m/six_degrees_of_separation," Ultimately, Six Degrees of Separation will succeed or fail for the individual viewer based on their expectations and preferences."
m/six_million_and_one, Fisher's use of POV shots overlaid with narrated readings from his father's diary poignantly captures his desire to consciously inhabit scarred spaces ...
m/six_sex_scenes_and_a_murder, These American teens really get under your skin. You'll be pissed. You'll be perplexed. You'll be totally riveted.
m/sixteen_candles," The plot is kinda corny, yet really enjoyable. The predictable happy end actually make you grin with pleasure."
m/sixth_day, The filmmakers are too willing to do whatever they think will push the audience's button.
m/sixth_man, This clumsy combo of cloying family drama and fantasy-enhanced courtside clowning is designed to draw tears and cheers. But jeers are more likely ...
m/sixth_sense, This will probably always stand as writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece.
m/skate_kitchen," Celebrates the liberation and the sisterhood that comes with skateboarding, with a mostly refreshing take on how teen girls deal with parents, boys and each other."
m/skateland," Burns, a former journalist and screenwriter, and cameraman Peter Simonite make great use of the film's East Texas setting. Skateland may be produced with limited resources, but Burns captures the look and spirit of the times with perfect detail."
m/skeletons," Though there's a little narrative drift in the middle, as a portrait of lives wrecked and remedied by memory's narcotic pull it's both strange and strangely moving."
m/skeletons_in_the_closet," There's no tension here, and when it comes to thrillers, that's about the worst transgression that exists."
m/sket_2011, A film of real substance that shows a timely interest in how and why gangs materialise.
m/sketches_of_frank_gehry, the film works because Gehry is what everyone wishes celebrities and artists to be: down to earth
m/skills-like-this," SKILLS LIKE THIS has a lot to offer, reminding us of the adage that the cheapest way to improve a film is with solid writing."
m/skin_2019," A powerful, if sensationalist, drama with a fierce central performance from Jamie Bell."
m/skin_a_history_of_nudity_in_the_movies," ""Thorough,"" in this case, feels like pandering to the prurient."
m/skin_in_the_game_2019," There's little development as it puts them (characters) through hell, focusing more on the issue than on the people experiencing it."
m/skin_trade, It's hard to tell if Skin Trade should be taken seriously.
m/skins," Eyre ... portrays contemporary life on the reservation, laying bare the harsh realities of alcoholism, poverty and despair."
m/skinwalkers, Skinwalkers plays more like '70s drive-in fare than a monster mash of recent vintage.
m/skiptrace," Skiptrace, which is a travelogue in the guise of an actionadventure comedy, feels more lacklustre than the average vehicle for the star."
m/skoonheid, Beauty is a confronting work that succeeds as a study of a false life lived badly and as a reflection upon a society grasping at traditional views to its own detriment.
m/skulls," The Skulls turns out to be such a mediocre, listless effort."
m/sky_2016," Are the French especially prone to this kind of unintended silliness? ""Sky"" almost seems determined to prove they are."
m/sky_captain," Fabulous stuff. Technologically fascinating, earnestly enjoyable and rewarding in its sincere sense of homage to earlier fiction and design."
m/sky_ladder_the_art_of_cai_guo_qiang_2016," ""Sky Ladder"" may not fully penetrate the mystery of Cai's artistic identity, but it ends with the poignant suggestion that the most significant accomplishments often stem from the simplest, most personal impulse."
m/skyfall," Skyfall is a resurrection, and will go down as one of 007's best."
m/skyline_2010," It certainly feels that the screenplay, full of cringingly cheesy dialogue and utterly reliant upon the most rote genre machinations, was never anything other than a frustrating annoyance for the Strause siblings."
m/skyman," In a scripted movie, even one without special effects, we know in the back of our head that anything could happen with equal plausibility."
m/skyscraper_2018," I almost admire the laziness of the scripting. In this overworked, underpaid country of ours, why begrudge a screenwriter seizing the chance to knock off early?"
m/slacker," This is a work of scatterbrained originality, funny, unexpected and ceaselessly engaging."
m/slackers," Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes, masturbation jokes, and racist Japanese jokes."
m/slam," The fiction element of the film, instead of driving Levin to deeper truths, delivers him toward triteness and manipulation."
m/slammin_salmon," Comedy troupe Broken Lizard returns with their fourth feature, which like its predecessors is funnier in concept than execution."
m/slap_shot, Outrageously fun hockey comedy. I wish the Hanson brothers from this film would come around to body check those other Hanson brothers and their MMM-BOP crapola
m/slash_2016, An engaging comedy-drama about adolescent outsiders who dabble in fan-fiction while inventing themselves.
m/slaughter_rule," A coming-of-age tale that nicely exploits the ruggedness of rural Montana and the rough-hewn, often tenuous nature of male friendships in those parts."
m/slaughterhouse_five," Interesting, if not fully realized, version of the Vonnegut novel."
m/slaughterhouse_rulez," Every cliché is an intentional parody but while there's enough suspense and humour to pass the time, this isn't as clever as previous Pegg/Frost/Wright classics such as Shaun Of The Dead."
m/slaves_of_new_york, Ivory observes these youthful shenanigans with a notably engaged sympathy.
m/slay_the_dragon," ""Slay the Dragon"" is the most important political film of the year, and it may prove to be one of the key political films of the decade."
m/slc_punk," SLC Punk cannot quite reach the richer depths it grasps for, because it doesn't have the material to support the large dramatic distance Stevo has to travel."
m/sleep_dealer," It's a good story and is well-acted and nicely shot, but its pace is disappointingly plodding."
m/sleep_furiously," Even though it's sometimes picturesque and involving, it's also so achingly slow and indulgent that it will test even the most patient viewers."
m/sleep_tight," So well-performed, finely crafted & classically constructed that it seems hard to accept that every twist and turn is leading up to a chillingly sick joke; but all this, including the dark humour, contributes to its decidedly Hitchcockian flavour."
m/sleepaway_camp," When Sleepaway Camp focuses on something other than the rapidly growing pile of corpses, the movie nearly grinds to a halt."
m/sleepaway_camp_ii_unhappy_campers," On a 'normal movie' scale, it'd rate Sleepaway Camp II pretty damn low, but the healthy body count and copious gore rates this a ""Must-See"" for any self-respecting horror freak."
m/sleepaway_camp_iii_teenage_wasteland," Think of the Sleepaway Camp trilogy as a live-action version of the ""Itchy & Scratchy"" cartoons that the Simpson kids love so much."
m/sleeping_beauty_2011, Julia Leigh's striking debut film is a treasure trove of formal artistry and psychological abstraction.
m/sleeping_giant," The ceaseless stupidity of men is lamented but also dissected in Sleeping Giant, a thoughtful, well-observed but also familiar coming-of-age drama."
m/sleeping_with_other_people," ""Sleeping With Other People"" is a love letter to New York romantic comedies, or at least a well-crafted sext."
m/sleeping_with_the_enemy," The film begins as an unyielding look at a battered wife, and ends as another one of those thrillers where the villain toys with his victim and the audience."
m/sleepless_2017," You could pretty much play American Police Movie bingo, checking off squares like ""undercover badass,"" ""tough-as-nails Internal Affairs lady,"" ""bug-eyed drug kingpin,"" and ""hero KOs guy twice his size and then magically fits into his jumpsuit."""
m/sleepless_night," less uniquely designed than just extremely well-crafted, combining a variety of familiar ideas into one cohesive, streamlined and supremely effective effort."
m/sleepover, Essentially sleepwalks its way through a strictly by-the-numbers premise.
m/sleepwalk_with_me_2012," Sleepwalk With Me is as charming as it is winningly modest, but it's so incredibly slight a stiff wind would knock it into a different hemisphere."
m/sleepwalkers," Plays as if King took it out of the trunk, blew the dust off, and cashed his check."
m/sleepwalking, This is a breakthrough performance [for AnnaSophia Robb] that should do wonders for her career.
m/sleepy_hollow," It's fun, it's funny, it looks great and it's got Johnny Depp. What else do you need to know about the movie, anyway?"
m/sleight," The element of magic - handled skillfully by Latimore and by Dillard, a magician since childhood - is enough of a novelty and an expansion of the gangbanger playbook to give Sleight some legs."
m/slender_man," Slender Man feels as used up as any years-old meme, like trying to explain what's funny about dat boi a decade late."
m/sleuth," Coming so shortly after Steve Buscemi's far more effective Interview, it's that much more obvious how flawed it is."
m/slice_2018," While Bennett might bring in viewers, this is a charismatic, however cluttered proclamation of another exciting film presence, his 'Angels' and 'Sunday Candy' music video director, Austin Vesely."
m/sliding_doors," Having to witness the doomed romance between Lynch and Paltrow play out twice over is nothing if not dull, as the events unfold with little nuance and few surprises."
m/sling_blade," If there were the slightest justice and curiosity in the Academy Award process, Thornton's work here would get a nomination."
m/slither," A groovy gross-out with snorts, scares and sentiment, SLiTHER is thus far the must-see frightfully funny movie of the year."
m/sliver," A hot follow-up to ""Basic Instinct""....just as sizzling"
m/slow_burn, While Slow Burn does admittedly pick up towards the end - as the film morphs into a flat-out ripoff of The Usual Suspects - there's virtually nothing in the first hour that even comes close to holding the viewer's interest.
m/slow_learners," A winsomely appealing opus that has enough funny lines, courtesy of screenwriter Matt Serword, situations and feckless loser characters to divert."
m/slow_west_2015," This classic western myth is presented as more of a fairy tale, with absurd and surreal encounters dominating Jay and Silas's journey."
m/sluggers_wife," It is one of the most disappointing, least credible films about baseball in recent memory."
m/slugs, Wooden is a polite word to describe the acting that goes on in Slugs.
m/slumber_party_massacre, Slumber Party Massacre is not a great film - the plot is thin and the performances occasionally a little awkward - but there's no doubt that it maintains its shock value.
m/slumdog_millionaire, Slumdog Millionaire is the film world's first globalized masterpiece.
m/slums_of_beverly_hills," Really, it sounds more intriguing than it is. Nothing really happens."
m/slutty_summer, The wooden dialogue and overall shallowness of the writing keep the film from being even an amiable diversion.
m/small_apartments_2012," The material is too thin to truly inspire, showing more skill as a map of madness, populated with greasy, grimy types who inhabit our world, yet refuse to abandon their own."
m/small_beautifully_moving_parts_2012, An intimate and well-acted drama about the technological tools in our lives and the quest of a young pregnant woman to reconcile with her long estranged mother.
m/small_crimes," Drained of humor - dark or otherwise - this crime thriller becomes one note, and that note is bleak."
m/small_soldiers," As with many films in which special effects are the real stars, the technology here commands more respect and interest than the material otherwise warrants."
m/small_time_2014," Small Time gets great mileage from its central characters, who manage to do some pretty mean things without coming across as irredeemably bad people."
m/small_time_crooks, The film features some of the best comedic acting that you will ever see. Period.
m/small_town_crime, A hardboiled melodrama with a heart of tarnished gold.
m/small_town_gay_bar," Ingram illustrates how gay bars function as oases of acceptance and alternative families for his good-humored, enduring subjects."
m/small_town_murder_songs," With his second feature, GassDonnelly achieves that longed-for thing, a whole greater than the parts, one in which each disparate element complements the other."
m/smallfoot," If ""Smallfoot"" proves anything, it's not the existence of yetis, but the need for a fresh approach to such lazy storytelling."
m/smash-his-camera, Gast's presentation is super-slick and surprisingly dynamic for a film concerned with still images.
m/smash_palace, Smash Palace is a revealing and involving Australian portrait of splitting up.
m/smashed, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul only serve to highlight everything that the rest of James Ponsoldt's film sorely lacks.
m/smiles_of_a_summer_night, Bergman was a master to have crafted all of this material together so that it was entertaining.
m/smiley_2012, This remainder-bin horror movie is impossible to take seriously.
m/smiley_face," Gregg Araki's latest foray into the slacker underbelly of suburban L.A., Smiley Face, has a wonderful performance by Anna Faris and one of the all-time great stoner monologues in movie history."
m/smoke_signals, Smoke Signals won the 1998 Sundance Festival film of the year.
m/smokey_and_the_bandit," Good, stupid fun, but a precursor to some awful copycats."
m/smokin_aces," Full respect to Carnahan for making the tired crime genre feel fresh, but it would have been more fun without a last-minute attempt to make it mean something."
m/smokin_aces_2_assassins_ball," Once you get past the boobs and blasts, the movie falls apart."
m/smother, Director and co-screenwriter Vince di Meglio handles this thin material without much subtlety.
m/smurfs_the_lost_village," Whatever I was expecting from the latest Smurf movie, it wasn't a sophisticated work of revisionist fan-fiction centred on the controversial figure of Smurfette."
m/snabba_cash_2012," ""Easy Money"" builds to a whopping finale that, without seeming to preach, bears out Mr. Espinosa's statement: ""Gangster films should always be moral stories."""
m/snake_eyes, The last five to 10 minutes are completely stupid and add nothing to the film.
m/snake_pit," For the audience of today, the primary draw of the picture is watching Olivia de Havilland deliver a particularly terrifying performance."
m/snakes_on_a_plane, Snakes on a Plane is kind of the ultimate B movie... One of the very best times I've ever had in a movie theater.
m/snapper," Stephen Frear's The Snapper hits the spot nicely, if your spot likes hearty rounds of working-class comedy."
m/snatch," Guy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is more of the same -- when you've got a hit, why change the formula?"
m/snatched_2017," ""Snatched"" is one of those movies that feels like a rough draft of itself."
m/snatchers," Snatchers boldly blends suburban-weirdness, silly sci-fi, goofy gore, and tender teen comedy to create a movie that feels like Clueless meets Gremlins."
m/sneakers, One of the cleverest updates of the caper film to appear in quite a while.
m/snitch_2013, The film's first half is weighed down by clichd dialogue and clunky drama.
m/snoopy_come_home, There's a certain moroseness to [the Peanuts movies] which is part of the reason why I like them... they are emotionally true and honest and treat kids as full human beings.
m/snow_angels," While often hard to watch because of its unflinching portrayal of the ugliness that love can take, Snow Angels succeeds because of the depth of its well-drawn characters."
m/snow_day," If Snow Day has a niche, it isn't quality; it's marketing."
m/snow_dogs, A fast paced comedic race through the wilds of Alaska. Cuba Gooding Jr. and the dogs provide solid entertainment for the whole family.
m/snow_falling_on_cedars," For all the beauty it struggles to bring forth, Snow Falling on Cedars is painfully prosaic."
m/snow_flower_and_the_secret_fan," This clumsy adaptation of Lisa See's popular novel may not be the biggest problem Rupert Murdoch's got on his plate, but it sure isn't going to help things, either."
m/snow_white_a_tale_of_terror, [W]hat was intended as dark gothic horror just comes off as something out a Renaissance Festival gone horribly wrong.
m/snow_white_and_the_huntsman," Every shot is beautifully composed and Sanders is able to create an atmosphere that draws you into a scene. It's just that, once inside, there are no great reveals."
m/snowden, It depicts Edward Snowden's ethical dilemmas in a political vacuum that disregards America's increasingly complex security threats.
m/snowmen, Here the yardstick for measuring existential accomplishment is to beat someone at something in the most spectacular way possible.
m/snowpiercer," Chris Evans takes charge on this truth as strange as science fiction express to nowhere, as a deprived but dashing commuter warrior on wheels. While facing off against a terror tycoon's lookalike dead ringers for the menacing hooded neo-nazis of Kiev."
m/snows_of_kilimanjaro," Plays better on the page than on stage or screen, but Peck and Gardner give it their all."
m/so_b_it, Dysfunctional-family mysteries are unearthed in this delicately rendered but rather pallid adaptation of a novel.
m/so_close, It has hot chicks who kick a**. Is there any other conceivable reason why you would see this movie? Excels thanks to some innovative action sequences and the charms of its leading ladies.
m/so_goes_the_nation," In dispassionately presenting American politics, even at its sleaziest, as an honorable craft, it may offer hope to small-d democrats of all flavors."
m/so_i_married_an_axe_murderer," Axe is not art by any means. It's often overly taken up with resolving itself. But Myers and others create an enjoyably loose, anti-slick feeling about the affair."
m/so_much_so_fast," So Much So Fast offers an unflinching look at the effects of a terminal diagnosis, not just on the victim, but on everyone around him."
m/so_undercover, That the movie is slated for a straight-to-DVD release in the US next year is probably indicative of its cinematic potential. It all feels a little bit sitcommy.
m/soaked_in_bleach," Whether he's way off base or not, Tom Grant is clearly a believer, and the ideas he presents via Soaked In Bleach-as unabashedly one-sided as they are-aren't easily dismissed."
m/soapdish," This is the kind of movie that is a balancing act, really."
m/sob, It seems more like an expectorant for Edwards' bile than an entertainment aimed at an audience.
m/sobibor, There is an evident disconnect between the story the film is trying to tell and how they want it to reach mass audiences. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/social_animals_2018," Neither celebrating nor bemoaning its subject, it gazes head-on at the ways some people embrace the chance to live life as a nonstop popularity contest while others are hurt by it."
m/society," An attempt to make a different movie. And yes, it's different indeed but different is far from the same thing as good"
m/socrates_2019," The film boasts a striking authenticity, and Malheiros, in his film debut, is pitch-perfect, conveying Sócrates' hunger (for food, money and love), his self-reliance and his despair in ways that are both heartbreaking and inspiring."
m/soft_skin, Truffaut's fourth feature... is assembled with the kind of wit and impeccable style that are in such shortage today.
m/softness_of_bodies," Thanks to tight control of the tone and a script committed to its barely coping characters the movie mines humor in unexpected places. However, the true reason to watch the movie is the lead actress."
m/solace, Throws up just enough intrigue and theological-ethical questions to qualify as one of the year's more guilty pleasures.
m/solarbabies," Since the movie so clearly required great dedication, especially in its visual effects and the use of its desert locations, I can only wonder why they didn't spend equal effort on finding an original story to tell."
m/solaris," Stephen Soderbergh takes Full Frontal into the stratosphere with Solaris, a prolonged grief counseling session with a minimalist sci-fi backdrop."
m/soldier_blue, The film is too mixed up to qualify as a serious allegory about anything.
m/soldiers_story," Did this movie have to be so lockstep, so trapped by its mechanical plot, so limited by a murder mystery?"
m/solid_gold_cadillac, Judy Holliday at her finest with great Paul Douglas support.
m/solis, The film would probably be much better if the sound mixer made the dialog easier to understand.
m/solitary_man, ...a low-key character study that's primarily held aloft by Douglas' expectedly ingratiating performance...
m/solitude2002," An intersibling death match reminiscent of Sam Shepard's True West, the independent feature Solitude details a tortured, possibly incestuous relationship."
m/sollers_point," It gains little momentum, and the result feels a little pallid, for all its lived-in, worn-through sense of place."
m/solo," Not one fight is memorable, and the set looks recycled from an Indiana Jones theme park."
m/solo_a_star_wars_story," Solo, the latest entry in the Lucasfilm franchise, brings Star Wars back to earth with a Millennium Falcon-rattling bump."
m/solo_con_tu_pareja," Sets a tone for Cuaron's later work, including a warm, sensual use of colors and space."
m/soloist," It's all a bit shapeless, yet made with sincerity and taste, and the two actors seize your sympathy."
m/solomon_and_sheba," It is highbrow nowadays to enjoy this sort of low- browedness, and not admit to too many yawns; all the same, after the first hour or so, I couldn't stop thinking of all the useful and pleasant things I might be doing if I was only outside the cinema."
m/solomon_kane," A solid fantasy flick, with a great role for star Purefoy."
m/some_days_are_better_than_others," The kind of American independent quirkfest that needs to be quarantined and examined, not valorized."
m/some_freaks," The deeper Some Freaks wades into what becomes a series of sadistic and masochistic humiliations, the more McDonald's film begins to feel schematic."
m/some_girls," There are some sweet moments and several very funny scenes, mostly of the door-slamming, mistaken identity variety."
m/some_girls_2013, Adam Brody strikes a deft balance of purposeful sincerity and sociopathic self-justification in the lead role.
m/some_guy_who_kills_people_2011," SGWKP is a slow but absorbing character study reminiscent of genre mash-ups like Baghead, Lars & The Real Girl, and Innkeepers. At its severed, bleeding and butchered heart, SGWKP is actually a relationship drama."
m/some_kind_of_beautiful," Kooky romantic comedies are nothing new and I don't mind retreads, but unfortunately Some Kind Of Beautiful is neither kooky, romantic, nor comedic."
m/some_kind_of_hero, There aren't enough good Richard Pryor bits in Some Kind of Hero which means that Pryor still isn't being used to his best advantage by Hollywood.
m/some_kind_of_wonderful," Like her energy, Masterson's beauty is kinetic, internalized, and she's a winner even if the film itself runs third in the Hughes opus on teenhood."
m/some_like_it_hot," Wilder's wise-cracking, gender-bending farce is a perfectly pitched comedy of romance and masquerade"
m/some_mothers_son," It is fascinating to see Kathleen's independent intelligence shining in the midst of other characters, on both sides, who are true believers."
m/some_velvet_morning_2013," A horror film with no blood, a rough ride that kicks you in the stomach"
m/somebody_up_there_likes_me," Robert Wise's direction is fast, aggressive and bright, and the picture is edited to give it a tremendous crispness and pace."
m/somebody_up_there_likes_me_2012," If nonchalance were an Olympic sport, Max would be a gold medalist, and watching Somebody Up There Likes Me is about as much fun as being a spectator at that event might sound."
m/someday_this_pain_will_be_useful_to_you," The film is a pleasant watch, filled with nice little moments of comedy and tenderness, and optimistic about the fate of dreamers who happen to be a little slow out of the starting gate."
m/someone_great, It's designed to be the perfect movie to rewatch for the 40th time while putting on your makeup.
m/someone_to_love," If you haven't been in a roomful of chatter about relationships lately and are aching for the experience, ''Someone to Love'' may be just the cure."
m/someone_to_watch_over_me," Intriguing cop thriller, with Lorraine Bracco stealing the show as the tough cop's wife."
m/somers_town, A pleasingly gauzy bit of nostalgia that feels softer and less cynical than anything I've previously seen in a [Shane] Meadows film.
m/somersault, This visually haunting coming-of-age tale marks the individual stamp of yet another original Australian female director to watch.
m/something," More a mood piece than a horror tale, ""Something"" is a low-budget movie that commands attention without the need for bells and whistles."
m/something_borrowed_2011," Light entertainment that should prove a popular choice for a girls' night out, although it's too long and most of the characters are irritating,"""
m/something_from_nothing_the_art_of_rap," An insightful film about the creative talents that have made hip-hop an original, enduring American musical tradition."
m/something_in_the_air_2013," A subdued portrayal of youthful idealism, even with surging hormones"
m/something_like_happiness, In the film's evocation of industrialized squalor you get an emphatic sense of location effecting personal action.
m/something_new, Look too closely and there will be questions about abandoned plot threads and excised scenes.
m/something_of_value," Brooks' chief insight -- good and bad on both sides, tolerance the answer -- hardly seizes the imagination, and the contentious climax, with Hudson carrying a wounded Poitier on his back, has every indication of being intended symbolically."
m/something_to_cheer_about, A reverential yet frustratingly skimpy nonfiction record.
m/something_to_talk_about," Director Lasse Hallstrom glazes the film with too much faux bluegrass music, and the equine fantasy-world of the King Ranch is so enveloping that it suffocates all aspirations to more serious drama."
m/something_wild," Despite the quirky trappings, Something Wild is often as tame as its star couple, a pair who scream Ivory soap and plenty of Miracle Whip."
m/somethings_gotta_give," But really, seriously, what woman wouldn't want to be Keaton, all sexy, funny, tender, quick, and never more charismatic in her animated access to her own feelings? And what man, of any age, wouldn't want to be with her?"
m/sometimes_a_great_notion," Newman starts tunneling under the material, coming up with all sorts of things we didn't quite expect, and along the way he proves himself as a director of sympathy and a sort of lyrical restraint."
m/sometimes_they_come_back," The show is a tight, moody work, just the ticket with a glass of hot milk to tide you over the noises outside your house."
m/sometimes_they_come_backfor_more_1999, A good example why they shouldn't come back for more.
m/somewhere_2010," Impressively directed and sharply observed, this is an enjoyable and engaging drama that features a superb soundtrack and terrific performances from Stephen Dorff and Elle Fanning."
m/somewhere_between_2011," Knowlton never delves far enough into her subjects' stories for Somewhere Between to feel more nuanced than, say, a good commercial for international child-adoption services."
m/somewhere_in_the_night, A no name cast conjures up some atmospheric thrills under the direction of Mankiewicz.
m/somewhere_in_time," The [Grand H]otel and Mackinac [Island] are spectacularly lovely, but fail to give substance to this ephemeral endeavor."
m/sommersby," It's really an old-fashioned hankie-soaker with Gere and Foster ably jerking tears. An odd yet convincing couple, they won't replace Rhett and Scarlet, and frankly, my dears, who can? But belles wring and bosoms heave in a manner most pleasing."
m/son-of-godzilla, Wanna know what it looks like when the bottom falls out of a movie franchise? Because it looks like Son of Godzilla.
m/son_of_a_gun_2015," Avery fashions a gritty, authentic mood in the opening scenes among the prisoners in maximum security, and carries it through to the satisfying conclusion"
m/son_of_batman," Son of Batman, the 20th DC Universe Animated Original Movie, makes considerable alterations to the original Grant Morrison comic book tale, but still delivers plenty of entertainment value for Bat-fans."
m/son_of_bigfoot, ... Son of Bigfoot contains plenty of memorable characters and dialogue.
m/son_of_frankenstein," The last great Universal Frankenstein feature, despite Rathbone's over-the-top performance. Karloff is splendid as the creature and Lugosi launches a new phase of his career as Igor."
m/son_of_god_2014," Considering that it's largely clipped together from the cable TV series ""The Bible,"" this is works well. Moving, lighter than ""The Passion."""
m/son_of_kong, A likable but wholly unnecessary sequel to King Kong.
m/son_of_man_2006," Son of Man boils down the life of Jesus Christ to 86 concise minutes, restoring layers of political motivation largely absent from The Passion of the Christ and adding stirring original vocal music."
m/son_of_rambow," Bright and witty physical and optical visual touches spill off the screen, though the use of effects is scaled to the tale."
m/son_of_saul, The young Hungarian director has to strike a tricky balance between verisimilitude and an acknowledgement that not even a hint of the true horror can be conveyed on screen.
m/son_of_the_mask," Loud, mean-spirited and generally obnoxious, Son of the Mask makes the boisterous 1994 original look downright demure and refined."
m/son_of_the_pink_panther, Edwards loses sight of what Benigni does best -- full-body physical shtick -- trapping him in long-shot gags that could be anybody.
m/sonatine, One of the most valuable facets of Kitano's film is its exposure of the gangster ideal as the myth of little boys who forgot to grow up.
m/song_of_bernadette," Like most DVD offerings in this very fine series from Fox, the transfer is pristine."
m/song_of_granite," Song of Granite ... begins to outstay its welcome. But until then, it's an undeniable beauty."
m/song_of_sparrows," With this simple story of real-life comedy and drama, + those small moral decisions we face every day, Majidi gives us a warmly involving and entertaining look at the earthy humanity of life in Iran"
m/song_of_the_sea_2014," This congenial animation may be somewhat unconventional, but children should respond to this nonetheless - and if not, parents most certainly will."
m/song_of_the_thin_man," The last of a six-film series was running out of gas, but it's still good, clean fun."
m/song_one, Perhaps the cleverest thing about Barker-Froyland's delicately contrived debut is how uncontrived she manages to make it seem.
m/song_remains_the_same, Seemingly interminable documentary with some good moments.
m/song_to_song," The result is disheartening and may even leave you resentful, with the knowledge that a true poet is painting with the same splendorous canvas, and yet still offering diminishing returns."
m/song_without_end, The great music is THE thing in this musical biography.
m/songcatcher," A mite melodramatic and a tad predictable, but the melody is pretty enough to keep one listening."
m/songs_my_brothers_taught_me, A Native-American brother and sister try in their own ways to find where they belong.
m/soni," A fly-on-the-wall observation of days in these women's lives, with each scene captured in a single take. It's an artistic choice that isn't about showing off so much as immersing us in these events without editing manipulations. It works beautifully."
m/sonic_the_hedgehog_2020," Eventually Jim Carrey shows up as the villain, all mustache and ego and wild-eyes and gadgets and insults, and things turn funnier."
m/sophie_and_the_rising_sun," There's a clumsy, soapy tepidness to the procession of plot points, but within individual scenes, the actors pierce the genteel surface."
m/sophies_choice," Incorporates one woman's narrative of surviving the Holocaust into a larger, crushingly banal story of a young, Southern writer's coming of age in the big city of New York."
m/sorcerers, Enjoy it as a simple horror film. Don't try and make it more than that.
m/sorcerers_apprentice," A tired relic of summer-movie cliches, clearly beaten to death by far too many credited writers."
m/sordid_lives," Sordid Lives feels like a play in perhaps the least successful way: It's composed of really long scenes that are mostly dialogue, with transition action imagined or implied only."
m/sorority_boys, Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment.
m/sorority_row," A 1980s horror remake finally graduates to being a fun, smart guilty pleasure."
m/sorry_haters," SORRY, HATERS is amazing. And not what you probably think from the title."
m/sorry_to_bother_you_2018, Sorry to Bother You is the rare 'crazy' movie that actually has something to say.
m/soul_boys_of_the_western_world_2015," Only deep-seated musical snobbery would hinder enjoyment of this definitive, authorised, fastidious,and perhaps overlong telling of the Spandau Ballet story ..."
m/soul_food, An attractive cast and lingering shots of artery-busting delights that amount to pigout pornography.
m/soul_man," In the end, however, it's let down by one easy laugh too many."
m/soul_on_a_string, Those who find their way to it will see breathtaking surroundings that shape the film's drama.
m/soul_plane," Soul Plane actually had me laughing with Tom Arnold... f'real. Yes, you heard right - I enjoyed this shizzle."
m/soul_power," The sporadic appearances by Ali hopelessly unbalance the proceedings, his fiercely outspoken interviews providing the only morsels of substance."
m/soul_surfer," Sappy melodrama, clumsy dialogue and heavy-handed proselytizing derail the inspirational story of teen surfer Bethany Hamilton."
m/soul_survivors, A by-the-numbers horror movie whose only real scare comes from the sudden blast of a starter's pistol at a swim meet.
m/soulmate_2016," SoulMate might have a familiar premise, hit some formulaic beats, and have a few pacing issues. But a movie is not just the story it presents, but also how it interweaves all the elements of film...the movie succeeds here in a way few recent films have."
m/sound_and_fury, A provocative documentary that is sure to make its audience consider things about deafness and handicaps in general that it might not otherwise.
m/sound_city," Mr. Grohl has put a lot of affection into this film, and it shows."
m/sound_of_music," Although a bit corny, it is a joyous musical odyssey suitable for the entire family."
m/sound_of_my_voice," Batmanglij keeps the movie even-keeled, full of medium close-ups, underscored by ambient plinks and shimmers, with nothing to break the trance until a last scene that upends everything we thought we knew."
m/sound_of_noise, The basic premise of this delightful comedy from Sweden is one of the most imaginative you'll ever see.
m/sound_of_thunder," Have you seen the trailer? If so, then that's as close to watching the movie as you should get."
m/soundtrack_for_a_revolution," They don't quite manage to pull it all together--the documentary segments barely skim the surface of this story, while the music is hit and miss--but it is a passionate film with an important story to tell."
m/soundwave," Ben is basically a superhero, and the movie is a promising introduction to his further adventures."
m/source_code, Quite deep and affecting on many levels with a premise that never gets dull or predictable or feels gimmicky.
m/south_central," News reports try to tell us what happened in Los Angeles, but fail, because they are limited to the facts. Movies like this one let us feel the emotions."
m/south_of_heaven_west_of_hell, It's best not to ask too many questions - better just to switch your brain to stand-by and enjoy the show.
m/south_of_the_border," Gritty, grassroots and genuine in spirit, this defiant doc's salt of the earth scrutiny initiates a reversal of the tide of corrupted US journalism. And lifts the entire entity out of its plague of self-censorship and debased opportunism."
m/south_pacific," One of the most popular musicals of the decade, despite artistic problems"
m/south_park_bigger_longer_and_uncut," Having seen the show on numerous occasions, I can say that it's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie."
m/southbound," Just as most of [the characters] can't outrun their pasts, neither can they escape familiar plot contrivances that try too hard and achieve too little."
m/southern_baptist_sissies," Designated for a safe space containing a receptive audience, the play neither provokes nor challenges. It preaches to the choir instead of spreading the word."
m/southerner, Jean Renoir is perhaps the greatest of all film directors. He is certainly the most lovable.
m/southie," A very familiar crime story, one that has been often done in recent times."
m/southland_tales," In its willful, self-involved eccentricity, Southland Tales is really something else. Kelly's movie may not be entirely coherent, but that's because there's so much it wants to say."
m/southlander-diary-of-a-desperate-musician, Pleasantly diverting no-budget comedy with fun cameo appearances.
m/southpaw_2015," If you come to terms with the fact that Southpaw doesn't bring any ideas to the canvas that are any newer than Wallace Beery, this is an energetic enough fight picture to capture the imagination."
m/southside_with_you," We just don't see this kind of thing here in America, but there's also never been a couple in the White House like Barack and Michelle Obama."
m/soylent_green," Thanks to Phil Hartman's riotous Saturday Night Live impersonation of Charlton Heston's hysterical detective from Soylent Green, people who've never seen Richard Fleischer's film know its surprise ending."
m/space_chimps_2_zartog_strikes_back, The CGI is beyond ropey (we're talking 1995 computer game levels); the script reads as though it was half-heartedly written during a hangover and every single main character is obnoxious.
m/space_cowboys, High-concept action adventure is a surefire summer crowd pleaser.
m/space_jam," This mediocrity disguised as entertainment, this greed promoted as synergy -- this, to paraphrase that seminal media study, Broadcast News, is what the devil looks like. It's Tasmanian, and it's coming to a multiplex near you."
m/space_station_76," As a repressed blowhard whose every suicide attempt is thwarted by the station's safety protocols, the boorish, mustachioed Wilson is hilarious in ways that his prior performances had only barely suggested."
m/spaceballs," How do you review a movie like this, anyway? I guess by saying whether you laughed or not. I did laugh, but not enough to recommend the film."
m/spaced_invaders," Maybe I've lost touch with silly, brainless entertainments like this. Let's hope so: One of the purposes of growing up and getting an education is to learn why movies like Spaced Invaders are a waste of time."
m/spacehunter_adventures_in_the_forbidden_zone, What could have been a sci-fi horror classic is instead just a better-than-average children's adventure story.
m/spaceman_2016," The effort is commendable, but the execution is rocky."
m/spaceship_earth_2020, A testament to the group of outsiders who did try to grab the world's attention about climate change through theatrics and to do something substantial about it.
m/spanglish," A neurotic wife hires a drop-dead gorgeous, Mexican housekeeper and then insists she spend 3 months in Malibu with the family. Yeah, wives do that all the time."
m/spanish_lake, A timely documentary taking a sobering look at life along the color line in an idyllic Missouri community located near Ferguson where life was irreversibly altered by integration followed by white flight.
m/spanish_prisoner," It's an interesting premise with more than a few Hitchcockian overtones. And because of that, it's easy to see why Mamet wants his actors to be so aloof - to make the audience wary of character motivations. But the strategy really backfires here."
m/spare_parts_2015," Derivative, overlong, a bit humor-starved, but watchable -- a ""Race With the Sun"" with robots"
m/spark_a_burning_man_story," The doc doesn't take the time to examine why Burning Man inspires such a level of fanaticism, overshadowing human interest with a gluttony of B roll."
m/spark_a_space_tail," One questions how a movie this ill-conceived even got made, and how writer-director Aaron Woodley recruited a voice cast that includes talent like Susan Sarandon, Patrick Stewart and Hilary Swank."
m/sparkle," Low-budget with a subtle script and real, rounded characters."
m/sparkle_2012, There may or may not be an actual movie hidden among all the showstopping musical numbers in Sparkle. Not that there needs to be.
m/sparks_2013," Here's a hearty keep-at-it award for Christopher Folino and Todd Burrows, directors of this restless, reckless superhero crime curio ..."
m/spartan, Mamet makes movies for people who love hearing themselves talk.
m/spawn," ... Spawn delivers as much eye candy as the best, but not nearly as much substance."
m/speak_2012," In the beginning ""Speak"" too often sounds like a recruiting film for Toastmasters, but it eventually gets past that and tells some compelling stories about the finalists."
m/speak_the_music_robert_mann_and_the_mysteries_of_chamber_music," Watching Mann teach is a delight for the same reason it is to watch him perform: It's because here, you sense, we are in the company of genius."
m/special, Genuinely original in parts but this works as a comedy only in places.
m/special_correspondents, A sitcom riff on Wag the Dog with its satirical edges sanded away.
m/special_day," In Ettore Scola's funny, humane A Special Day, Antonietta and Gabriele are never really a couple, but their brief encounter lights up the screen with the kind of radiance you get only from great movie actors who also are great stars."
m/special_effects," A significant (if ultimately chaotic) entry in the director's canon of ramshackle tributes to the dark, dangerous, voyeuristic allure of the cinema."
m/special_forces_2012," Solid entertainment, a chest-thumping (and reporter-hating) recruiting film in the ""Act of Valor"" mold - but with a French accent."
m/special_id," Hard-core action movies like this, with difficult physical stunts and limited special effects, are hard to find these days. Fans should not miss the chance to see the ageless Donnie Yen."
m/special_treatment," Huppert is always a welcome presence on screen and while strong performances give the film weight, they cannot rescue the journey as the narrative dips in and out of credibility"
m/species," The rest of the film is pretty simple-minded -- the team stalks her, she stalks men in L.A. bars, and gross-out special effects stalk the audience."
m/species_2," what can be said about a movie that focuses largely on the struggle of government agents to keep ex-astronauts from having sex? Leave it to Dr. Baker: 'It's awful,' she moans, prior to the slime-drenched finale. 'Just awful!'"
m/species_iii, ...Species III is often incredibly dull - no small feat given the amount of nudity and violence in the flick.
m/spectre_2015," No film series has been better at raiding its own mausoleum, and throughout Spectre, ghosts of Bond films past come gliding through the film, trailing shivers of pleasure in their wake."
m/speech_and_debate_2017," Over all, the movie ... has a focus problem that leaves its humorous moments obscured and its intentions hazy."
m/speed_1994," The film takes off from formula elements, but it manipulates those elements so skillfully, with such a canny mixture of delirium and restraint, that I walked out of the picture with the rare sensation that every gaudy thrill had been earned."
m/speed_2_cruise_control, Speed 2 can be numbered among the worst second chapters ever made.
m/speed_dating_2010, Tries to coax laughs from characters so dated even Eddie Murphy would balk.
m/speed_kills," This movie not only refuses to tell a story - it undermines the viewers' attempts to interpret the narrative for themselves. It's a montage run amok. It's a film stitched out of senseless scenes, devoid of tension or even logic."
m/speed_of_life_2019, There just isn't enough to this script to make the Bowie premise of the picture a promise the movie can keep.
m/speed_racer," Like other Wachowski works, this hybrid of f/x-driven family fare is technically inventive and in moments seductively surreal, but the plot is so slender and naive, sort of excuse for some thrilling races that should please very young non-critical viewers"
m/speed_sisters," If Vin Diesel is looking to up the ante for the next ""Furious"" entry, he might start by looking at the Speed Sisters."
m/speedway_junky," The film belongs to Jordan Brower, whose every appearance breaks one's heart, and makes some otherwise familiar material come alive."
m/speedy," Highlights include a wild chase scene through New York City traffic, a visit to Coney Island by Speedy and Jane, and a guest appearance by Babe Ruth..."
m/speedy_singh_2011," There are no surprises here, with father-son crisis and reconciliation, scaled-down quasi-Bollywood production numbers and the climactic big game all arriving on cue."
m/spenser_confidential, Spenser Confidential is a movie your dad's fine with.
m/sphere," Most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects. Levinson tries second-tier effects, and first-tier actors, but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer."
m/spice_world," Ultimately, Spice World's real analogue isn't A Hard Day's Night but the cruddy, engagingly lightweight cash-ins that followed, from Freddie and the Dreamers' Seaside Swingers all the way to The Monkees on TV."
m/spider_baby," Simultaneously creepy and hilarious, this is the perfect slice of Grand Guignol for a humid summer's night."
m/spider_in_the_web, A somewhat convoluted thriller with John Le Carré pretensions that succeeds more than it fails.
m/spider_man_far_from_home," 'Far From Home' has this confidence that's admirable. It gets weird, goofy and keeps you on your toes, which is what you want out of a franchise that has 20-+ movies in it. Go have a blast!"
m/spider_man_homecoming," The characters and scenarios are familiar, but this is a loose, cool, funny remix that makes them feel fresh again. Plus, it's mercifully short on life lessons from Aunt May."
m/spider_man_into_the_spider_verse, It's the best stand-alone film to feature the iconic character so far.
m/spiderhole," Writer-director Daniel Simpson ratchets up the tension, fully acquainting viewers with the soon-to-be victims before letting fly with an all-daggers-stabbing orgy of violence..."
m/spiderman," Once it gets rolling, it gets past the CG problems that plague the early swinging sequences and there are a couple of truly first-rate action sequences."
m/spiderman_2," Like Spider-Man before it, Spider-Man 2 is a superhero flick bursting at the seams with big emotions."
m/spiderman_3," Facing a tough challenge as a follow-up to the superlative Spidey 2, new segment is bigger (in budget), longer (139 minutes), awesome (in CGI), and darker (black is dominant color), featuring more villains than in the first two installments."
m/spiders_2013, What has happened to America's cheesy film industry? Where is the pride of our grade-Z filmmakers? Does no one care anymore about making decent bad movies?
m/spiders_part_1_the_the_golden_lake," It's apparent that Lang was enjoying himself on this production, and the fact that he returned to the genre forty years later is also telling."
m/spiderwick_chronicles," [The] combination of creature effects, action and believable situations is what ultimately puts the movie on par with the first couple 'Harry Potter' movies."
m/spies_in_disguise," Run-of-the-mill modern-day animated fare, but it's also hard to say no to Tom Holland and Will Smith playing off of one another"
m/spies_like_us, Often funny film boasts no less then 10 film directors on screen in small roles. Stick around for the Paul McCartney penned title song.
m/spike_island, Underwhelming drama about a fledgling band trying to get to the Stone Roses' momentous 1990 gig in order to pass on their demo to Ian Brown.
m/spin_out, It is always rather chilling to see a homegrown flick of any calibre fold like a cheap card table in front of a paying crowd.
m/spine_tingler_the_william_castle_story, A long overdue and very entertaining documentary on one of Hollywood's most colorful salesmen.
m/spinning_into_butter, The best of intentions and a welcome willingness to engage on the touchiest issues is not enough to keep this movie from feeling more like a seminar than a story.
m/spinning_man, Fine performances can't save this formulaic suspenser.
m/spinning_plates, So involving that one might not notice until afterward that little in the way of a unified theme emerges to turn Joseph Levy's feature into something more than a semi-random survey of restaurant life.
m/spiral_2018," ""Spiral"" proves a largely underwhelming look at an overwhelming problem."
m/spirit_of_76, You might get a campish kick from The Spirit of '76...Where else can you find a film that has teen idol David Cassidy sharing time with new wave fave Devo?
m/spirit_of_st_louis," Not one of Billy Wilder's strong features, this biopic of the ace flyer is too conventional, lacking the helmer's more characteristic humor, irony, cynicism."
m/spirit_stallion_of_the_cimarron," Offers a morose, pallid account of how the West was lost, straight from the horse's mouth."
m/spirit_trap," Fairly standard haunted house stuff, really. But a high energy level and a willingness to go way over the top makes it quite entertaining."
m/spirited_away," It's easy to give this one credit for the mind-blowing creativity, but I can't recommend this to anyone who's not already a fan of Miyazaki or mind-expanding drugs...it's just not going to translate."
m/spitfire_grill," Original in some ways but the same old plate of fried green tomatoes in others, this Sundance Festival favorite might rate wider acclaim for its two leads if the overall tone weren't so bloodless and even dreary."
m/splendor_in_the_grass," A complicated film that never really successfully yokes together the themes of money-making and sexuality, it reveals both Kazan's operatic sensibility and his inability to follow an argument rigorously through."
m/splinters_2011, Offers a compelling look at the preparations undertaken by two rival wave-rider clubs in the town of Vanimo.
m/split_2017," M. Night Shyamalan is back, baby, and the best he's been in decades."
m/spoken_word, Features more cliches than it can comfortably handle and is not helped by its grindingly slow pacing.
m/spongebob_squarepants_movie," The film is not only true to the show's zany spirit, but manages to sustain that zaniness for a whole 90 minutes."
m/spork_2010," For all its poignancy, ""Spork"" never loses sight of its goal to be zesty, sharp-witted fun."
m/spotlight_2015, It's that all-too-rare beast: a movie that's both important and engrossing.
m/spread," Ashton Kutcher's stud for sale does a glum gigolo making sex look like awfully hard work, while his current high price tag prey Anne Heche checks into a hospital for genital rejuvenation, don't ask."
m/spree_2020," [T]he exaggeration of Eugene Kotlyarenko's sixth feature takes a pretty long time to come around, and when it does, it goes on for far too long and without enough edge."
m/spring_2015, splices the DNA of Before Sunrise (1995) and Possession (1981) to engender a monster movie at the shoreline of biology and romance.
m/spring_breakdown, A very bad genre exercise starring some very good comedic actresses who really should change agencies soon.
m/spring_breakers_2013, Spring Breakers is all surface and sham; it's trash about humpers.
m/spring_forward," What a treat to finally see a pudgy character actor and a stereotypically type cast ""bad guy"" demonstrate their consummate acting skills"
m/spring_summer_fall_winterand_spring," Just as every action in the film has its own reaction, every image evokes the oneness of the film's characters to their natural surroundings."
m/springsteen_and_i_2013," Springsteen & I is an emotionally raw, intimate glimpse at hero worship and what it is to be a Bruce fan."
m/springsteen_on_broadway," Not only does ""Springsteen on Broadway"" work on its own as a Netflix special, it gives you all the same feels seeing the show live at the Walter Kerr Theater brought out."
m/springtime-in-a-small-town, Tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to Liyan's backyard.
m/sprinter," This jogs along a predictable path, but makes a mad dash straight for the audience's gut right before the finish line."
m/spun, Easily one of the most vile experiences I've ever had in a movie theater.
m/sputnik_2020," Lacking in killer instinct, Sputnik is a competently put together film which could have benefited more from its deadly concept."
m/spy_2015," McCarthy and Byrne's scenes together are cruelly hilarious, with the kind of no-holds-barred insult humor that makes you instinctively drop your jaw and cover your mouth."
m/spy_game, The core of this story is so riveting and strong that not even Scott's misguided efforts to dress it up can completely ruin it.
m/spy_hard," When Spy Hard abruptly ends after only 81 minutes, you sense that it has used up every last round of available ammunition. It was simply exhausted and couldn't move another inch."
m/spy_intervention," The espionage component never generates the slightest hint of genuine danger, and the romantic element is contrived and obvious."
m/spy_kids, Spy Kids achieves the one thing Hollywood struggles to do in live action: It's a family film that's cool.
m/spy_kids_2_island_of_lost_dreams," Rock solid family fun out of the gates, extremely imaginative through out, but wanes in the middle"
m/spy_kids_3d_game_over," If you can't push the envelope forward, you can still succeed by pulling it back--to the 1950's. 'House of Wax' anyone?"
m/spy_kids_all_the_time_in_the_world_in_4d," A passable shake-up, even if its 'Aroma-scope' experiment stinks. Like Ricky Gervais, the Spy Kids franchise could drone on - sorry, go on - forever."
m/spy_next_door, It's a sad day for Jackie Chan fans when the action-comedy star is reduced to a vehicle as lame as The Spy Next Door.
m/spy_who_loved_me," Roger Moore may not be the toughest of the Bonds, and he may not be the wittiest, but he is the smoothest."
m/spymate_2006, Your tolerance for Spymate is going to be directly related to your tolerance for animal tricks.
m/squanto_a_warriors_tale," Squanto is the kind of superficial, tidied-up, idealized history that might appeal to younger viewers. No thoughtful person will be able to take it seriously."
m/square_grouper_the_godfathers_of_ganja, Square Grouper's admirably backhanded inquiry into the social and economic costs of weed criminalization extends far beyond the wake-and-bake crowd.
m/squid_and_the_whale, Makes up in strong performances and wry observation what it sometimes lacks in narrative drive.
m/st_agatha," Kern and Hennesy deliver powerhouse performances that leave you gripping your seat and holding your breath. Bousman knows how to ramp up the tension in measured strokes, barely allowing the audience time to gasp for more air."
m/st_bernard_syndicate," ""St. Bernard Syndicate,"" directed by satirical documentarian Mads Brügger, begins as an amusingly eccentric, mockumentary-style comedy but runs out of gas about halfway through."
m/st_elmos_fire, An unforgettable master-piece. One of the best films for young people ever made. The young cast are splendid.
m/st_ives, St. Ives is an ambitious Charles Bronson picture that looks good but finally doesn't quite work.
m/st_trinians," When you look at it again, the old film was not only superior but rather more radical. This St Trinian's looks as if it is aiming at the lowest common denominator, and finding it too often."
m/st_trinians_ii_the_legend_of_frittons_gold," Cheap, ramshackle entertainment that's nevertheless imbued with affection."
m/st_vincent," Amusing enough as long as Bill Murray sticks to his mean and ornery act but ultimately reveals its true self as a film equivalent of the gooey 1971 Ray Stevens song ""Everything Is Beautiful."""
m/stage_beauty," A bawdy, rude film that wins us over with sheer energy."
m/stage_door," A stellar cast, superb direction, and a screenplay even better than the stage play on which it was based, all add up to one of the best movies about show business -- or about women living together -- ever made."
m/stage_fright_2014," Stage Fright rocks hard, sings proud, and leaves audiences begging for a wild, bloody encore."
m/stake_land," There are actually moments of fun and happiness. That's an area that The Road Warrior, The Road and any other post-apocalyptic thriller never really explored. Then when that respite is destroyed it's even more tragic."
m/stalag_17," Grimly hilarious, subversive and defiant, rough around the edges, and more than a little sad."
m/stalingrad_2014," The 3D effects of explosions and plane crashes are plentiful and impressive; the one-dimensional storytelling and stiff subtitles, rather less so."
m/stalking_moon," Robert Mulligan was the only American filmmaker to wade into such painfully vexing and frightfully bourgeois territory, and come out with a truly great film."
m/stan_helsing_a_parody," The generically attractive young cast gamely tries to pump life into the script, to no avail."
m/stand_and_deliver," There were moments in Stand and Deliver that moved me very deeply and other moments so artificial and contrived that I wanted to edit them out, right then and there."
m/stand_by_me_1986, An ode to youthful friendship and a lament for the loss of that precious bond between grown men.
m/stand_clear_of_the_closing_doors, An indirect tribute to the 1951 independent landmark The Little Fugitive
m/stand_up_guys," Standout performances from Pacino, Walken and Arkin as old-timers prove that losing a step can't keep you off your feet."
m/standard_operating_procedure," Though the humiliating treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib has been shown before, Errol Morris creatively uses re-enactments and animation to hammer home his points."
m/standing_in_the_shadows_of_motown, There are suckers out there for the film's brand of shrink-wrapped nostalgia. I'm not one of them.
m/standing_ovation_2010," It's amateurish, woefully acted by a majority of the cast, and features music even Miley Cyrus would be embarrassed to sing, but it's certainly kooky. Compellingly so at times."
m/standing_up_falling_down, Billy Crystal has never been better than he is in this film.
m/standoff_2016," This overly talky, slackly executed game of cat-and-mouse comes off as cheesy rather than chilling."
m/stanley_and_iris, The elements are in place but they don't add up to great drama in this well-meant effort to personalize the plight of illiterate people.
m/stanley_kubrick_a_life_in_pictures," Like the man himself, the fascination with Stanley Kubrick: A Life In Pictures lies in the details."
m/star_80, It's a fairly straightforward premise that's employed to pedestrian and mostly uninvolving effect...
m/star_chamber, The Star Chamber works brilliantly until it locks into a plot. Then it stops dancing and starts marching.
m/star_maps, Star Maps reads like a collision involving three or four scripts in different stages of development.
m/star_trek_11," A stupendous production, Star Trek goes where no movie sequel or prequel has gone before in bringing intelligence and invention to a peak in cinematic storytelling."
m/star_trek_beyond," I can think of no better way to celebrate Star Trek's 50th anniversary than with this film, which embraces everything that's great about the series."
m/star_trek_first_contact, Even if you don't count yourself as trekkie you should see it.
m/star_trek_generations," Everything this picture does differently is a piece of a potentially exciting story, but there just isn't any glue to hold this model Enterprise together."
m/star_trek_ii_the_wrath_of_khan," Star Trek II added hefty doses of action, adventure, and suspense, injecting life into a concept that had been left moribund by its first big-screen feature."
m/star_trek_iii_the_search_for_spock, Familiarity breeds contempt since this is not really a notable entry in the Star Trek series.
m/star_trek_insurrection," Insurrection offers endless pleasure and inside jokes for the hardcore fans, but it's less urgent than First Contact, the dynamic last installment of the series."
m/star_trek_into_darkness," After a confident take-off, Abrams keeps the franchise flying with a faster, faster, FASTER sequel that makes for the most thrilling Star Trek since First Contact."
m/star_trek_iv_the_voyage_home, The original cast appears to be having more fun than they ever had before.
m/star_trek_nemesis, A school-teacher's dream as Patrick Stewart tells his nemesis that the principal goal of every human being should be to become a better person.
m/star_trek_the_motion_picture," So okay, perhaps the plot is somewhat substandard but the glorious special effects thrown up by director Robert Wise ... and a no doubt expert team of special effects craftsmen actually makes this one well worth seeing."
m/star_trek_v_the_final_frontier," The whole point of the movie has something to do with the search for God and Eden, but the theme is presented in the most mundane fashion imaginable."
m/star_trek_vi_the_undiscovered_country," Rich, action-filled and loaded with familiar literary and political references, not to mention a number of savvy in-jokes, Star Trek VI is an utter delight that should more than please fans of the series."
m/star_wars," Watching this movie will help you relive your childhood, or help make new memories with your own kids."
m/star_wars_episode_i_the_phantom_menace, George Lucas is a wizard at populating a world with everything but people.
m/star_wars_episode_ii_attack_of_the_clones," Here we are again: not entertained, not nearly enough, by an installment of the Star Wars epic that, for the first time, exhibits symptoms of... nerves."
m/star_wars_episode_iii_revenge_of_the_sith," The magic died a long time ago, see, Episode III is just the death twitch."
m/star_wars_episode_vi_return_of_the_jedi," The film is a huge, rousing finale that resolves all plot twists, settles all accounts, reunites old friends and sweeps to a climax that all but blows the theater apart."
m/star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens," The director, J.J. Abrams, recaptures the pop lightness that made the first Star Wars seem simultaneously eternal and effervescent."
m/star_wars_the_last_jedi, Nothing can prepare you for what Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers and that's exactly what makes so damn near perfect.
m/star_wars_the_rise_of_skywalker," Throughout Star Wars:The Rise of Skywalker, you'll keep waiting for that moment. But that lump in your throat, that ache in your heart that could only result from such beloved fictions becoming something more real, it never comes."
m/starbuck," Huard's charm offsets the plots contrivances, while Ken Scott's finely balanced direction humanises the high concept."
m/starcrash," This isn't a bad movie like The Switch or Grown Ups, where even once is too much; this is the type to be savored again and again, like a patented Ed Wood mess-terpiece."
m/stardog_and_turbocat," A good entry point, but they haven't reached the stars yet."
m/stardust, Simply divine fantasy. Pfeiffer casts a spell on it outshining the fallen star.
m/stardust_memories," Woody the pretentious; has some moments, but overall it's too self-conscious."
m/starfish_2019," In his debut feature Starfish, first-time filmmaker A.T. White (frontman of the UK band Ghostlight) mixes science fiction, Lovecraftian monsters, and a stirring indie soundtrack to convey a deeply personal story about grief and loss."
m/stargate, A cinematic fireworks show without the grand finale.
m/stark_raving_mad," Stark Raving Mad is a great comedy and one of the better recent heist flicks; more importantly, it's one of the best direct-to-video movies I've seen lately."
m/starlet_2012," The film works as a charming aesthetic exercise with its jerky camera and inadvertent cuts, as a contemplation on intergenerational female bonding."
m/starman," Starman contains the potential to be a very silly movie, but the two actors have so much sympathy for their characters that the movie, advertised as space fiction, turns into one of 1984's more touching love stories."
m/starred_up," This isn't Mackenzie's most interesting work, but you could do much worse for an issue movie."
m/starry_eyes," Starry Eyes balances Hollywood satire and splattery gore in a way that's both fresh and inviting, taking a typical struggling actress and exploiting her story with everything the horror genre has to offer."
m/stars_and_strife, A hopeful film examining our current condition and how we might be able to dig our way out.
m/stars_fell_on_henrietta," The film lays meticulous groundwork for a payoff that never takes place. The last 20 minutes, which should deliver a big emotional punch, simply do not work."
m/starship_troopers," The acting by all concerned makes the cast of 'Melrose Place' look like the Royal Shakespeare Company, as statuesque model-types bark out lines like 'Everyone fights, no one quits!' and 'Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!' with clueless conviction."
m/starship_troopers_2_hero_of_the_federation," Isn't Verhoeven's original, but it's still a pleasing second coming for the bug squashers"
m/starship_troopers_3_marauder," There's not an ounce of charm, delight, tension, suspense, excitement, fright, magic, or wonder in the whole affair."
m/starsky_and_hutch," A surprisingly good time and perhaps even a wakeup call for the once great Ben Stiller, world's most ape-like comedian."
m/start_the_revolution_without_me," Seems like a Mel Brooks farce, but it's a Yorkin! Pretty zany."
m/starter_for_ten," Even though it doesn't have an original bone in its body, it's got that dorky goodness you want from a movie about people in their late teens."
m/starting_out_in_the_evening," Andrew Wagner's mature, sharply observed, quietly intense drama about the shifting relationship between an aging, sickly writer and an ambitious grad student (one third of his age) impresses as one of the best in the dramatic competition series this year"
m/startupcom," A sobering, highly entertaining insight into the innards of that up-and-down business world."
m/state_and_main, Much like the sophisticated comedies of Preston Sturgess.
m/state_like_sleep," A narcotized neo-noir that unfolds with the diverting purposelessness of a forgettable dream, Meredith Danluck's State Like Sleep doesn't really go anywhere."
m/state_property, Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago.
m/state_property_two," Attempts at real ruggish posturing -- like that de rigueur sideways-gatted, full-body-exposure firing stance -- are just plain laughable."
m/statement," Splendid performances, especially from leads Michael Caine, Tilda Swinton and Jeremy Northam, a pulse-quickening pace and production values that establish story and character within a distinct environment."
m/stateside," The promise of something startling and compelling goes unfulfilled, and the arc of the central love story isn't interesting enough to sustain the drama."
m/station_agent," The word 'lovely' comes to mind in assessing this intimate, character-driven piece about a man who tries to get away from people but finds to his luck that he cannot."
m/stations_of_the_cross," While the scenes are evidently precisely choreographed, they also feel entirely naturalistic, like we are simply observing life."
m/stations_of_the_elevated," Lumbering, skronking, and wondrously paint-bombed, Manfred Kirchheimer's Stations of the Elevated (1981) is a 45-minute proto-hip-hop bliss-out, a masterpiece of train- and tag-spotting ..."
m/status_update," If ever a film demanded to be viewed on a phone, it's this one."
m/stay," Forster presents to us the despair of the world as a soulless, Euro-trashy video installation."
m/stay_2013," Too often ... the darker, more serious moments in Stay are only temporary distractions from the main event - a familiar tale of romantic separation and reconciliation."
m/stay_human, ...the documentary boasts a number of unexpectedly engrossing and palpably emotional stretches that prove exceedingly difficult to resist...
m/stay_hungry," Very much a product of its time, Stay Hungry is indulgent and only sporadically amusing, but kept afloat by a typically charming Jeff Bridges."
m/stay_tuned," Peter Hyams, who has flopped in virtually every genre, despite a strong visual sensibility fleetingly in evidence here, seems devoid of comic ideas at each heavyhanded turn."
m/staying_alive, More like staying dead...a monotonous and unnecessary sequel that has all the grace and flow of a greased hog on rollerskates
m/steal_a_pencil_for_me, Describing what Steal a Pencil for Me is about might actually do a disservice to this affectionately observed documentary.
m/steal_this_movie," The greater part of [D'Onofrio's] performance comes of as simply hysterical and shrill, an overwrought portrait of a raving lunatic who just happened to be exceedingly principled."
m/stealing_beauty," The film does have a small mystery in it, but it is easily solvable and plays only a small part in the plot."
m/stealing_harvard," As for the antics themselves, the early ones lack, sometimes loudly lacking. But like John's dumb-determination, the script keeps rubbing its two sticks together until something funny sparks. A weak B+."
m/stealing_home," Stealing Home is a real squirmer, a movie so earnest and sincere and pathetic and dripping with pathos that it cries out to be satirized."
m/steam, Writer-director Kyle Schickner embraces every cliche with gusto. (Behold the cruel intolerance of the patriarchy!)
m/steamboat_bill_jr," Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928) is the last of physical comedian Buster Keaton's (the Great Stone Face) nine independent feature films and one"
m/steamboy," A mostly entertaining visual treat and while better than a lot of other films out there, pales in comparison to what might have been."
m/steel_city," A family drama that is the visual equivalent of a Bruce Springsteen song, Steel City offers several standout performances and a satisfying low-key story."
m/steel_helmet, [Sam] Fuller's powerful direction turns a trite story into a vivid study of national and personal identity.
m/steel_magnolias," Field does some spectacular underplaying through the bulk of the action, revealing layer after layer of the feelings of this kindly tempered, deeply worried mother."
m/steelyard_blues," Perhaps the best American comedy since The President's Analyst, mainly because its humour is never imposed, but allowed to develop from the situations in which the characters find themselves."
m/steep, You can choose to risk a heart attack watching these skiers take off on 55-degree mountain passes or breaking your neck trying imitating them yourself. Thrilling sport. Great photography.
m/stella_days," Thanks to its understated elegance and surpassing central performance, this modest, too-eagerly schematic period drama is more engrossing than it has a right to be."
m/stella_street," The audience will be small for Stella Street, a daft mockumentary based on a BBC-TV skit about celebrities who converge on suburbia."
m/stellas_last_weekend," Though it doesn't always hit the mark, it's sometimes very sweet, and its appeal will extend beyond the dog lovers in the audience."
m/stendhal_syndrome," serves as a devastating, nihilistic attack on the failures--and fascinatingly, the successes--of Argento's oeuvre to this point."
m/step_into_liquid," [A] draggy, visually underwhelming portrait of contemporary surf culture."
m/step_sisters," ...while the stigma of skin color starts to fade in time for the film to make its statement on different worlds (from race to gender to class) relating and bonding over what they have in common, it's just a bit too late."
m/step_up, The dubious concept of blending ballet with hip-hop dancing is explored only as far as line dance choreography will allow in this clich-riddled romance that coasts on the strength of its charismatic leads...
m/step_up_2_the_streets, A decided step down even from the mediocre original.
m/step_up_3, Some of the best street dancing ever committed to the big screen.
m/step_up_all_in," Eager young dance fans will sit through stale storylines as long as the movie can supply fresh moves, and in that department, Sie and her team of three choreographers have it covered."
m/step_up_revolution, The film busts a fierce move but never relishes the unique cultural essence that its gentrifying baddie threatens to snuff out.
m/stepfather, May be the best movie about the breakup of a family since Shoot the Moon.
m/stepfather_ii, ...a tiresome sequel that boasts little worth recommending aside from Terry O'Quinn's expectedly electrifying performance.
m/stepford_wives," This is not just a bad film, it is a patently offensive one"
m/stephen-kings-it1990," As made-for-TV horror, it lacks real bite, but still has a fine unsettling atmosphere. And let's face it: clowns are REALLY scary."
m/stephen_kings_a_good_marriage," Stephen King's tense psychological thriller asks the question, What would you do if you discovered that your husband is a serial killer?"
m/stephen_kings_silver_bullet, There are all sorts of sly satiric touches in the film.
m/stephen_kings_the_langoliers," As the scriptwriter for ""The Langoliers,"" [Tom] Holland has strung together some of the clunkiest dialogue you're ever likely to hear. As the director he has encouraged his mediocre cast to overact shamelessly."
m/stephen_tobolowskys_birthday_party," As possibly the most recognizable character actor of our generation, Stephen Tobolowsky has given us a gift for his birthday. It's a window into his bizarre, unglamorous life."
m/stepmom," Not since 1979's Kramer vs. Kramer has a mainstream movie more accurately, insightfully, humorously or tear-jerkingly dramatized family life in our time than Stepmom!"
m/sterile_cuckoo," Liza Minnelli starring as a free spirit named ""Pookie"" could get old fast--but it doesn't, and the movie is warm and engaging."
m/steve_and_sky," As aimless as its protagonists, Steve + Sky proves equally inept at irreverence and profundity."
m/steve_jobs_2015," Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who's written about America's Great Flawed Men with such fire and hyperarticulate pathos that he's threatened to become one himself, outdoes his work on The Social Network with an even sharper and more savage script."
m/steve_jobs_man_in_the_machine, Alex Gibney takes on Steve Jobs and society's ongoing Apple addiction in this deeply critical biographical portrait.
m/steve_jobs_the_lost_interview, It's a tribute to the singular popularity of Steve Jobs that he's probably the only talking head people would pay to watch for more than an hour.
m/steve_martin_and_martin_short_an_evening_you_will_forget_for_the_rest_of_your_life," It is aggressively affable and very broad, and sometimes that's just what you need."
m/steve_mcqueen_the_man_and_le_mans," While I think it's a worthwhile doc, it runs too long and paints a rather (unintended, I believe) poor portrait of McQueen."
m/steven_tyler_out_on_a_limb," A fun concert film too-often interrupted by unilluminating and fawning ""behind the scenes"" flattery."
m/stevie," While it was well worth seeing, it didn't have the lift that I might have liked, literally and figuratively."
m/stevie_nicks_in_your_dreams," While watching people write is rarely effective cinema, the only thing less gripping is watching people track boring albums, which Nicks and her band do throughout In Your Dreams."
m/stick, The unfairly maligned Stick is actually a very good underworld thriller with Burt Reynolds at his absolute coolest.
m/stick_it," We already have Bring It On, and it's on basic cable 17 times a day. We don't need another one, as it's already been brought."
m/stiff-upper-lips," Merely proves that feeble, witless jokes will flop no matter how grand the setting."
m/stigmata, The scariest thing about this appalling and seemingly endless movie is that you paid for your ticket and now have to sit through it.
m/still_alice," In the wrong hands, this is the stuff of disease-of-the-week sentimentality, but Still Alice stays away from that terrain by focusing less on the illness than on the emotional effects it has on all involved."
m/still_bill," Though he's ready with easy charm, [Withers'] sensibly jaded edge makes things interesting (both tendencies may be reactions to stuttering since childhood)."
m/still_breathing," The film's success ultimately rests on the couple -- and not once in this film, aside from a lot of wispy talk about fate and dreams, did I see any reason why these two opposites would be drawn to each other."
m/still_crazy," There are worse ways to kill and hour and a half, but I'd rather watch a movie with midgets dancing around a foot-high model of Stonehenge."
m/still_here," While some aspects of this movie feel off the mark, others are spot-on, and the finished product, while not a particularly good mystery, at least becomes a decent, earnest social drama."
m/still_mine," As far as films about couples dealing with the female partner losing her mind go, Still Mine is pretty pedestrian."
m/still_of_the_night," Apesar do roteiro estúpido e absurdo, o filme tem boa edição, conseguindo criar suspense em algumas seqüências. Incrível que tenha sido dirigido por Benton depois de Kramer Vs. Kramer."
m/still_smokin," This film is nothing more than an excuse to cobble together some sketches, which range from utterly dull and stupid to mildly titillating due to some nude nubile actresses."
m/stillborn_2018, Still/Born gives Burke full rein and reaps the rewards.
m/stink," Like any of these documentaries, this one's all over the map, but Whelan grounds it in his family."
m/stir_crazy, ...one can't help but wish that director Sidney Poitier had just let Wilder and Pryor do their thing.
m/stir_of_echoes," Stir of Echoes is one of the year's best films, is based on a best selling novel, and features Kevin Bacon in one of his most skilful performances."
m/stitch_the_movie," It is missing a great deal of the original movie's heart... This one's more sitcom-y, less endearing, a little bland."
m/stitches_2012, A Halloween crowd-pleaser that's missing a few tricks and treats.
m/stoker_2013," Stoker proves that not only can Park Chan-Wook do what others like Polanski and Jeunet have sometimes failed to do, but he can do it with just the same amount of gusto and which panache that made all of his Korean films so damn good."
m/stolen," A docu that should appeal not just to the legion of Vermeer fans, but to lovers of good mystery."
m/stolen_2012," In Stolen, [Cage] steals away with nothing; he's simply stalled out."
m/stolen_seas_2013," With his much more than meets the eye pursuit of raw unfiltered truth, Payne navigates the turbulent waters of piracy, as it has been impacted by the legacy of colonialism and rebellion, and the military hardware industry profiteering also kicking in."
m/stolen_summer," Stolen Summer is no disaster, though. It's merely one more misfire fortunate enough to attract actors like Bonnie Hunt and Aidan Quinn, who almost make it work."
m/stomp_the_yard," Dave Scott's choreography is often dynamic and imaginative, but only a true fan is going to crave this much stepping."
m/stone," While Stone may not be a film you'll want to rush out to once it opens in a few weeks, if you want to see a somewhat unconventional thriller, this would make a solid rental."
m/stone_bros_2009," Harold And Kumar Go To Kalgoorlie? A cruisey comedy you'll like to like, even when the buzz flickers."
m/stoned, The film dishes oodles of sex and drugs but skimps on the rock 'n' roll.
m/stonewall_2015," Emmerich, who put his own money into making the film, should be cheered for giving it a shot. Unfortunately the compromises he's made leave Stonewall feeling neutered."
m/stoning_of_soraya_m, It is impossible not to be moved by such a heartbreaking story.
m/stop_loss," Stop Loss was just a big hot mess of a film, that I'm sure will sell well with teenage girls."
m/stop_making_sense," a decade and a half later, the music and brash presence of creative genius still byrne down the house."
m/stop_or_my_mom_will_shoot," As irksome as it is, the concept is actually better for Stallone than the premises of his earlier awful romps."
m/stop_the_pounding_heart," It's not quite The Hills, as there's very much the sense that these characters, or versions of them, do actually exist, and Minervi is clearly fascinated in their realities, but there simply isn't enough here to really engage."
m/storage_24," There's enough gore, ideas and self-aware absurdity here to make it something a bit more enticing than merely Alien: The EastEnders Redux."
m/stories_we_tell," Tthe probing, emotionally devastating documentary that was, for this critic and many others, the revelation of the first week of the Venice Film Festival."""
m/storks," Storks is uncomfortably unfunny and tonally confused, primed to leave children with so many questions for parents to awkwardly stumble over during any post-screening car rides home."
m/storm_surfers_3d," The twin Australian ideals of outdoor adventure and ecstatic camaraderie achieve harmonic convergence in the visceral, extreme-sport thrill-ride Storm Surfers 3D."
m/story_of_a_love_affair, The unsurpassed beauty of Antonioni's visual art lifts his two-penny story and hollow people into the exalted realm of the senses.
m/story_of_us," Thanks to Mr. Willis and Ms. Pfeiffer, The Story of Us has moments of warmth and charm."
m/story_of_vernon_and_irene_castle, Perhaps the best the marvelous couple have made since Gay Divorce.
m/storytelling, Squanders a terrific cast and some tremendous early promise on a weak structure.
m/straight_outta_compton, The highly entertaining and sprawling biopic starts out with its pulse on the nation only to somewhat devolve into standard Behind the Music backstage melodrama.
m/straight_story, The Straight Story is the kind of triumph that most filmmakers as distinctively talented as David Lynch can only dream about.
m/straight_talk, ...an agreeable yet hopelessly forgettable little romcom.
m/straight_time, Straight Time packs a punch--thanks to the intense and well-modulated performance by Dustin Hoffman.
m/straight_to_hell," The story is hilariously pointless, seemingly moving forward with random events just to fill up a feature-length time slot."
m/straightjacket," The perkiness with a capital P, gorgeous set and great color can't completely salvage an occasionally strong cast and middling story (and don't forget a lousy, if literal, title)."
m/straitjacket, This one has a very high quality of dialogue and performance.
m/stranded_2012," It may suggest an Alien incarnate, but once you get past its exterior, it's as empty as outer space."
m/stranded_i_have_come_from_a_plane_that_crashed_on_the_mountains," Stranded: I've Come From a Plane That Crashed in the Mountains is an oxymoron: a docu constructed from re-enactments, talking heads and no actual footage of the story it tells, but that still packs a knock-out punch."
m/strange_affair_of_uncle_harry," The acutely recorded small-town characters and atmospheres, and the intense performances of all four principal players, are something more."
m/strange_bedfellows, A series of hilarious moments along with some astute insight.
m/strange_brew, It's funnier than most of ths films Hollywood passes off as humor ten years later.
m/strange_but_true," A wonderfully woven tale of grief, belief and the things we keep hidden."
m/strange_cargo," This enjoyable adventure is a good star vehicle for Cark Gable, then at the height of his popularity, and Joan Crawford."
m/strange_love_of_martha_ivers, slick entertainment with a taut narrative and shrewd direction
m/strange_magic," I've not completely fallen in love with ""Strange Magic,"" but it did in its own way cast a spell."
m/strange_powers_stephin_merritt_and_the_magnetic_fields," I'm not sure it would be possible, or desirable, for a documentary to reveal any more about Stephin Merritt than this one does. But I would have loved to see one that revealed more about his music."
m/strange_wilderness, I doubt many people are going to find it funny without some sort of chemical help.
m/strange_woman," Grim look at an evil femme fatale and the men she lures into murder, it is far from Ulmer's best."
m/strangeland," Twisted Sister's Dee Snider makes a movie -- a must-see, right? Wrong-o!"
m/stranger_among_us," Though this movie is indefensible in terms of virtually any critical standard I can call to mind, I wouldn't have wanted to miss a single second of it."
m/stranger_by_the_lake," Hot and cold and provocative in more than just the expected ways, Stranger by the Lake presents even the most dishonest sex as an honest thrill."
m/stranger_than_fiction," It remains inventive and funny to the end, features fine performances from Will Ferrell and especially Emma Thompson, and offers enough to enjoy and dispute to make it a good B.O. attraction."
m/stranger_than_paradise," This austere, minimalist comedy put NY's East Village and Jim Jarmusch on the map, displaying unique sensibility and aesthetics (single long shots). Though only his second work, it's still Jarmusch's best picture--by far."
m/strangerland_2015," Overlong, ambiguous, and unsatisfying, yet marked by beautiful cinematography and a few terrific performances."
m/stratton," What can never be escaped, though, is the utterly formulaic nature of the storytelling."
m/stratton_story," Amidst a script that starts, stalls and plods along, Stewart is an inspiration who could probably tell 'Yo Mamma jokes to the Brady clan and Partridge family and still be their best friend."
m/straw-dogs-2011," A solid, tense drama that packs a wallop..a smart, provocative - and exceptionally intense and exciting - movie."
m/strawberry_blonde," It is funny, it is fresh, it is charming and it is thrilling. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/strawberry_flavored_plastic, Strawberry Flavored Plastic is a film of stunning power and intelligence. Everyone in the cast delivers the screenplay's smart dialogue with gusto and intensity.
m/stray_2018, It's the kind of indie art-house film that lets you love it for itself.
m/stray_2019," Despite its flaws, this curious little hybrid is bound to intrigue and has enough going on to be worth seeking out by genre fans."
m/stray_bullets, Fessenden is literally sixteen years old - it's impossible not to give the film kudos for being a not-bad genre exercise that shows promise for its precocious director.
m/stray_dolls, An emotionally driven crime drama following two disenfranchised young women determined to seize control of their lives on their own terms.
m/streamers, The ensemble cast comes up smart with some fine spontaneous performances.
m/street_fighter_the_legend_of_chun_li, Devotees of the video game [would] do better to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs in front of a monitor.
m/street_kings," A combination of implausible plot-points, and the miscasting of television's Hugh Laurie as Internal Affairs chief Captain Biggs, hampers a convoluted crime thriller that is nonetheless entertaining for its grotesque action sequences."
m/street_smart," A clever thriller with a lot of unbelievable scenes and a sappy ending, but two wonderful performances."
m/streetdance_2d," The homegrown appeal of StreetDance gets lost in a sequel with one foot across the pond, the other over the channel."
m/streetlight_harmonies," It engenders great respect for the artists, and a desire not only to seek out and revisit the songs it features but also to go beyond the film's selections and uncover the rest of what doo-wop had to offer."
m/streets_of_blood," a direct-to-video Festival of the Absurd so over-the-top, so incompetently made, so lacking in decent taste and common sense that the only thing missing to keep it from late-night Skinemax is a couple of sleazy softcore sex scenes"
m/streets_of_fire," Ah, a classic hyperbolic rock-fueled action movie. The pinnacle of 80s guilty pleasure cinema."
m/stretch_2014," While Stretch is a little rough around the edges it's also endearing, often exciting and packed with laughs."
m/strictly_business," There are moments that work, and others that do not (no young man, not even Waymon, could be as uncoordinated on a dance floor as he seems to be). But beneath the plot, which is routine, are a lot of assumptions that are not."
m/strike1924, Eisenstein's first feature also remains his most watchable.
m/strike_2020," A cute movie for very young children, filled with lovely attention to detail and terrific voice work from Waterworth, Stott and the cast."
m/striking_distance, Striking Distance is an exhausted reassembly of bits and pieces from all the other movies that are more or less exactly like this one.
m/stripes," Trust me, it was a whole lot funnier when you were ten."
m/striptease," Striptease has the inert, cruddy-looking ambiance of a straight-to-tape thriller."
m/stroker_ace, Burt Reynolds used to make movies about people's lifestyles. Now he seems more interested in making movies that fit in with his own lifestyle.
m/strong_island," Solemn, searching and at times even poetic in its indignation, this is a sensitively crafted contemplation of corrosive grief, even if the unanswerable questions surrounding the case keep the film somewhat emotionally muted."
m/stronger_2017," Green looks for small but meaningful ways to complicate and deepen the well-trod story he's telling, and by the end, those complications help the film earn its uplift."
m/strongman_2009, A warts-and-all documentary from first-time director Zachary Levy that moves in close and stays there.
m/stroszek," When the film clicks, it's because Herzog has populated it with mostly non-actors he stumbled across in the midst of filming."
m/struck_by_lightning_2012," What makes this film rise a bit above the pack is the recurring idea that everyone wants to leave their nests and fly high into the sky, but few are able."
m/stuart_little, This is really a series of set pieces with the logic of seeing what scrapes the makers can get Stuart into next.
m/stuart_little_2," It's all harmless fun for kids, and if the story gets a bit too cloying for their parents, there are the ingenious visual effects to make up for it."
m/stuart_saves_his_family," Stuart is a disarming figure -- likable in small doses, but fragile and not particularly adaptable."
m/stuber, A riotous retro pairing of serious violence and serious laughs.
m/stuck," The director approaches the fact-based story with equal amounts of disdain, fascination and bemusement."
m/stuck_between_stations," There's an overapplication of split-screen and woozy soundtrack cues to this end, but Lister Jones and Rosen do an appealing back-and-forth with lively dialogue, not dulled in the interest of realism."
m/stuck_in_love," The sharp edges of the story are sentimentally sanded down; there's a fair bit of slush, and it's a pretty quaint view of what writers and a writer's life are actually like."
m/stuck_on_you, Effectively mixes sentiment with a one-joke comedy.
m/student_of_the_year," If you have patience and a taste for the overblown, check it out..."
m/stuff, 'Are you eating it? Or is it eating you?' I love it!
m/stunt_man," The Stunt Man is the most exuberant piece of kinetic filmmaking ever produced. I daresay it's also one of the best American films of the 1980s, and, ironically, one of the most overlooked and unknown."
m/stuntwomen," In a way, Stuntwomen also makes the case for a stunt ensemble Oscar even if the film doesn't outright say it."
m/stupids, It's so screamingly unfunny it verges on the surreal.
m/sturm, The portrait may be accurate but Schmid's overly muted take on the story hardly does justice to the stark terror and injustice that lies at its core.
m/styx_2019," It's engrossing, if (somewhat ironically, considering the open sea setting) dry fare made by and for stalwarts of the European academic set."
m/subject_two," O curioso roteiro passa perto de algumas boas questões filosóficas, abandonando-as por aparente falta de ambição. Ainda assim, prende a atenção até o fim; não com suspense, mas com seus personagens."
m/sublime, It's less a visual tour-de-force than force-fed pretentious shots meant to convey artistry.
m/submarine-2010," Submarine feels like the most refreshing, urgent and original debut the British film industry has seen in years."
m/submerged_2015," Submerged has a great premise, which it promptly proceeds to screw up in every manner conceivable."
m/submergence_2018, Even two glamorous and well-matched stars of the moment can't do much to undermine the Wenders meander.
m/subspecies," The special effects are great, the atmosphere is super, and the drama is intelligent. There is also plenty of gore."
m/suburban_commando," By golly, by the time it was over, I was feeling kind of tired of going to the movies."
m/suburban_girl, Suburban Girl never finds the charm it thinks it has.
m/suburbicon," There's a lot of entertainment value in the movie's bits, because Clooney is not only an excellent director of actors, he's got a great eye for shots and a good head for individual scenes."
m/sucker_punch_2011, It's so bad that the Director's Guild should revoke Snyder's membership and he should never be allowed to direct again.
m/sudden_impact," The worst of the Dirty Harry films, made even more excruciating by Sondra Locke's presence. Fans of the series will find several worthwhile moments, however."
m/suddenly_last_summer," The main trouble with this picture is that an idea that is good for not much more than a blackout is stretched to exhausting length and, for all its fine cast and big direction, it is badly, pretentiously played."
m/sueno, Sings a lovely tune but chokes on its own banal lyrics.
m/suffragette," The supporting cast, including Helena Bonham Carter, Romola Garai and Anne-Marie Duff, are all top notch, and a reminder of how few films like this exist anywhere."
m/sugar_and_spice, There just isn't enough material here to justify a running time of this length.
m/sugar_mountain," The plot twists we get are not the ones we want. They look like complications, but they don't deepen the story or connect it to any wider ideas."
m/suicide_kings," The superfluous characters are almost as plentiful as the flashbacks. If someone can explain to me what Laura San Giacomo's purpose was in this film, I'll give them a dollar."
m/suicide_squad_2016," DC's Suicide Squad is rough and jagged, but still entertains. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and the rest of the actors give good performances."
m/suicide_squad_hell_to_pay," Not everything about Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay works, but the film's sense of humor, willingness to kill off key characters, and exploration of a spiritual subject matter make it worth a look-see."
m/sukai_kurora," The gun never goes off, but the possibility (the precipice) remains."
m/sukiyaki_western_django," Basic joke wears off after five minutes, and many bystanders will start to head out of town."
m/sullivans_travels," It's a great comedy, with a message that works in context, the flophouses of life's downside contrasting with Hollywood's absurd hedonism."
m/sully," Eastwood delivers an earnest, straightforward look at the way the captain's professionalism saved the day. But while that aspect of the movie hits more than a few obvious notes, the crash is the real star of the show."
m/sum_of_all_fears," Directed brilliantly, it is a great film whose power might have been missed or ridiculed before 9-11 and whose subject would have been too hard to take right after 9-11."
m/summer-wars, Hosoda adds enough dimensions to his characters and kinetic battles that the serene real world seems like a dream state.
m/summer_04, Summer '04 more than confirms the promise of young Teuton helmer Stefan Krohmer.
m/summer_camp_2016, Summer Camp is great horror entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]
m/summer_catch," Prinze's next ""summer catch"" is liable to be a venereal disease."
m/summer_hours, A quietly observed Chekhovian drama about the effects of globalization on a French family.
m/summer_in_february," Not quite a masterpiece, but unquestionably displays some impressive flourishes that will stir and move."
m/summer_love, 'Whatever' is likely to be auds' response to this occasionally engaging but often ineptly made exercise in postmodern irony.
m/summer_night_2019, Summer Fun could have been made at any time in the last 30 years -- and that's oddly a strike against it.
m/summer_of_42," It's apparent in every scene that this is a highly personal film for screenwriter Raucher, and the nostalgia is so palpable that it nearly slides off the screen."
m/summer_of_blood," Like many of Brooklyn's hipper inhabitants, Summer of Blood tries very hard to be cool, but instead comes off as strained and aloof, with a number of satiric targets it could have aimed for but just bypasses altogether."
m/summer_of_sam, A hodgepodge of dull characters played by even duller actors with occasionally interesting photography and an irritating score.
m/summer_place," Reflecting the sexual angsts and domestic anxieties of the 1950s, Delmer Daves' schmaltzy melodrama is known today for catapulting Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee to stardom and for Max Steiner's melodic tune, which became that year's most popular song."
m/summer_rental, ...an entirely forgettable endeavor that'd hardly be worth mentioning were it not for Candy's energetic performance.
m/summer_stock, ...has a certain looseness compared to other MGM musicals.
m/summerland_2020," Summerland, while it's an original screenplay, has the feel of sentimental historical fiction, the kind of decorous novel that's a dime a dozen as Brit TV miniseries material."
m/summerland_2020_2," It likely won't change your life like, say, actually going on a long road trip with friends, but it's an enjoyable enough way to spend 80 minutes."
m/summers_tale, A delightful document on the dilemmas of young lurve -- all courtesy of a filmmaker belying his 76 years.
m/summertime," As a coming-of-age story it remains touching. As a showcase for Katharine Hepburn, it is superb."
m/sun_choke, Style and substance come together perfectly in this unique psychological thriller.
m/sun_dogs_2017," It connects with intimate moments, with Morrison preserving as much personality and private yearning as possible, keeping the picture away from becoming a complete cartoon."
m/sun_ra_a_joyful_noise," Provides a revelatory showcase for Sun Ra's art, which was anchored by a nucleus of musicians living and rehearsing in a house in Philadelphia, joined by others on a temporary basis to make a big band."
m/sunday_bloody_sunday," The director, John Schlesinger, has no real cinematic sense; he just picks a tone and a look and lets the action unwind."
m/sunday_in_new_york_1963," Norman Krasna's screenplay, from his Broadway legiter, doesn't really get rolling until it has virtually marked time for almost an hour, but once it gets up this head of steam the entire complexion of the picture seems to change."
m/sundays_illness, ... an unusual dramatic and emotional intensity. [Full review in Spanish]
m/sundown_2016, A film so forgettable it will be out of your head the moment you step out of the theater. [Full review in Spanish]
m/sunlight_jr," Unflinchingly honest and grim, Sunlight Jr. is a valuable piece of work from a filmmaker who has a distinctive voice and concerns."
m/sunrise," One of the select few films in history that show what the medium is capable of attaining at its highest, most exalted state."
m/sunset," Half of the movie wants to be cheerful, and the other half seems morbid and disenchanted."
m/sunset_2018," Sunset is so messy, long and confusing that you can't help wonder if Nemes is just a one-trick pony."
m/sunset_boulevard," No other motion picture about Hollywood comes near Billy Wilder's searing, uncompromising and utterly fascinating portrait of the film community."
m/sunset_edge, Writer-director Daniel Peddle's anthropological concerns never really wed themselves to a sturdy narrative bedrock.
m/sunset_park," Sunset Park begins with good intentions, and the cast manages some convincing moments together, but the movie never really jells."
m/sunset_song," A wistful remembrance of the joys and sorrows, triumphs and tragedies that mark a human life. You suspect it is a film with the force to linger and grow in the memory."
m/sunshine," If you were expecting Danny Boyle to do for sci-fi what he did for the zombie flick with 28 Days Later, then you'd be disappointed . . ."
m/sunshine_cleaning," Zany postmortem hick flick with New Mexico sisterhood in scrubs, channel surfing for mom, and beyond the call of duty girl bonding over an edible necklace. Sunshine Cleaning is economic crisis cinema on the grim side, but irresistibly Albu-quirky."
m/sunshine_state," You can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale, and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling."
m/sunshine_superman, Sunshine Superman captures both the awe and terror of the sport [Boenish] loved until the day it brought about his death.
m/super," What's finally depressing about The Super is that it doesn't have the nerve to be any one thing. It wants to be crude and rude, but it ends with sentiment. It wants to be about whites and blacks, but is incurious about the lives of its black characters."
m/super-2010, James Gunn has made the ultimate Troma movie with his new deranged superhero black comedy Super
m/super-high-me," Comedian Doug Benson determines what it would be like to get high for thirty days. What would this prove? Probably nothing, but it was really funny to watch."
m/super_8," Super 8 is the perfect summer movie riddled with the kind of action, heart, and fun that most filmmakers would kill to be able to conjure."
m/super_babies_baby_geniuses_2, Features even more toddlers acting in a way only collectors of velvet paintings will consider irresistible.
m/super_capers, Super Capers doesn't ever come close to justifying its existence.
m/super_dark_times," At what feels suspiciously like the Robert-McKee-approved screenplay page number for Beginning of Act 3, an unnecessary new development is introduced, and then ill-advisedly followed through on, right to its sensationalist genre-tinged conclusion."
m/super_duper_alice_cooper," Something like a cinematic Wikipedia entry, Super Duper Alice Cooper re-establishes the already familiar story of the rocker, but never stops long enough at any moment to get any real meaning out of it."
m/super_size_me, A hilarious and often terrifying look at the effects of fast food on the human body.
m/super_size_me_2_holy_chicken, A smug odyssey of know-it-all-ism that yields a scant few factoids we didn't already learn from his first film.
m/super_troopers," ...if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy, the troopers will entertain with their gross outs, bawdy comedy and head games."
m/super_troopers_2," Despite a recycled plot and some jokes that land with a thud, Super Troopers 2 is another goofy, raucous ride with a cast that all seem delighted to be there."
m/superbad, It helps that the fun doesn't stop. It helps even more that the pitch-perfect script doesn't step out of character for a joke.
m/supercon," There's a need for a snarky, cynical look at the con experience from the inside. Supercon could have been that film, but it went too low-brow to deliver on its potential."
m/supercop, Supercop is at its most banal when it apes the Western action style and at its best when Jackie is interacting with the scenery and props around him.
m/supercross, The sport of Supercross serves as the backdrop for an excruciatingly earnest sports-themed action movie geared to speed-minded teens.
m/superfly, This is a quintessential blaxploitation film. And it's fun as hell to watch.
m/superfly_2018," How Youngblood Priest deals with the Man this time around may be the stuff of purest revenge fantasy, but it also touches a nerve that is hard to dismiss as anything but real."
m/supergirl," Miss Slater makes a four-square heroine of unrelenting sincerity; a sturdy ingenue, she is great fun to look at but hardly a live wire."
m/superman_doomsday, Timm and co. manage to create one of the better Superman films to date with animation that takes an edgier angle on the past Timm style...
m/superman_ii," Substantial credit should also go to Terence Stamp's casually menacing General Zod, who transcends his terrible costume and make-up to appear a convincing threat."
m/superman_iii," Reeve continues his traditions of graceful flying moves, confident carriage, and twinkly warmth. Sadly, none of it is enough to save Superman III from being at home only in a junkyard."
m/superman_iv_the_quest_for_peace," By ordinary movie standards it's awful, but fans of cinematic dementia should have fun for about half an hour."
m/superman_man_of_steel," ""Man of Steel"" takes a fresh approach to the well-worn origin of the Superman narrative (first published as Action Comics #1 in 1938)."
m/superman_red_son," With a strong story and a stellar cast, Superman: Red Son features complex and compelling takes on characters like Superman and Lex Luthor which help put it up there with classics like Under The Red Hood and The Killing Joke."
m/superman_returns, A heartfelt Superman movie that plays to a broad audience thanks to an emotionally troubled Man of Steel.
m/superman_the_movie," Though Superman has aged more gracefully than many '70s sci-fi films, the film's drawn-out first act may make viewers long for the more modern wham-blam style of comic-book movies."
m/superman_unbound," Feels cinematic, despite the fact that it wasn't made for the big screen."
m/supermensch_the_legend_of_shep_gordon," ""Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon,"" the directorial debut of Mike Myers, is a vaudeville celebrity remembrance of mega-manager Shep Gordon by stars who might have starved without Gordon's help."
m/supervized," This is a crude, R-rated farce full of promise, but Supervised is one word that doesn't seem to have been applied to the script."
m/support_your_local_sheriff, Garner is a master playing the easy-going straight man with a mix of wit and practicality...
m/supporting_characters," In its sharply etched sketches of personal and professional frissons, Supporting Characters belies the modesty of both its lo-fi setup and its self-effacing title."
m/surfer_dude," ...limp and rambling picture, which crawls across the screen for about 30 minutes longer than it has any need to."
m/surfs_up, A movie made for people who think dogs playing poker is funny.
m/surfwise," Documentarian Doug Pray (""Scratch"") connects the narrative dots between the Paskowitz's nine children that survived their unconventional upbringing with varying degrees of success. You have to see this unusual story to believe it."
m/surrogate_valentine_2011," Cultivates a sweet, shucksy tone that wears thin in some of the early scenes but ultimately deepens into genuine heart."
m/surveillance," A violent B-movie bamboozler that, while fun for a spell, is finally unconvincing."
m/survival_of_the_dead, Evidence of a veteran horror guy who still has a few colorful stories left to tell. With zombies.
m/survive_the_night_2020," There's virtually no suspense in the rote hostage drama, which, contrary to the title, takes place over a night and much of the following morning."
m/surviving_christmas, Maybe the producers brought this movie out more than two months before Christmas to prevent themselves from spoiling it.
m/surviving_progress_2011, Surviving Progress offers a cinematic wakeup call so cogent and non-didactic even Tea Partyers would be hard-pressed to shrug it off.
m/surviving_the_game," Cheesy take-off of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" although it's got a lot of low-rent b-movie energy."
m/survivor_2015," There's no question where any of this is going, and although the chase can be entertaining at times, the movie is ultimately forgettable."
m/survivors," Williams, Matthau, and Reed struggle with the material and generate some bright moments, but overall The Survivors is a bewildering, frustrating movie."
m/survivors_guide_to_prison," A sobering look at a life any of us, if enough things work against us, could find ourselves living, ""Survivor's Guide to Prison"" is a film that should not be missed."
m/susanne_bartsch_on_top," Auntie Mame once insisted that ""life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death."" That sentiment is echoed in a new documentary about a nonfictional Mame, Susanne Bartsch, who reigned in New York during the post-Warhol era."
m/sushi_girl," There's nothing wrong with paying homage to a film that went before (Reservoir Dogs), if you make it clear that's what you're doing. I never got that vibe with ""Sushi Girl."""
m/sushi_the_global_catch_2012," The film's arguments about sustainability are convincing and hard to shake. And, the movie suggests, you - the sushi eater - can help: Crave it and enjoy it, but eat sushi responsibly."
m/suspect_zero," Serial killer film flops are a dime a dozen, and Suspect Zero-a supernatural-tinged rehash of countless superior thrillers-is worth slightly less than a penny."
m/suspended_animation," If the third-act denoument is predictable, the film has already delivered more twists than the average genre picture."
m/suspiria_2018," Guadagnino directs the hell out of his Suspiria, heightening the sound design and using cuts that feel more like stabs. He wallows in the impressionistic weather - it only stops raining to start snowing - and gives a wonderful sense of place."
m/suzi_q, A conventional but revealing pop star/rock star bio-doc
m/swades," The slow-burning Swades requires a bit of patience from its viewers, but such an investment is a minimal expense when the payoff is richly rewarding."
m/swallow," By the end, characters who initially seemed so simple have taken on startlingly different personas, revealing the true face of an oppressive system in the process - one in which men make the rules, and can institutionalize those who don't conform."
m/swamp_thing, A movie that elevates bad moviemaking to a new level.
m/swan_princess, [It has] this local pedigree that just makes me inclined to to think favorably of it but I have to admit it's not a very strong film.
m/swarm," A number of journalists, rolling in the aisles with laughter, were ejected from the press screening."
m/swat, Director Clark Johnson keeps the action and the story interest flowing without letting romance and other distracting details bog things down.
m/sweaty_betty_2016," This isn't hard-times reportage or a deep-dive ethnography. It's a life-as-it's-lived picture, a chance to meet and loiter with the people in the places the interstates zip past."
m/sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street_2007, This represents one happy instance of a film made by a director without stage experience that genuinely serves the intentions of the original piece.
m/sweet_bean," The film's inoffensive simplicity suggests finger-painting, and offers about as much sophistication in terms of character development and theme."
m/sweet_hearts_dance, Presents a slow and leisurely look at sexual politics in and out of marriage.
m/sweet_hereafter, The naked emotion of tragedy weighs on every frame...
m/sweet_home_alabama," Making only a minimal effort to be any different...than the hundreds of other forgettable, predictable, almost-married-the-wrong-guy romantic comedies that have come before it..."
m/sweet_land, This is an intelligently told story that relies on intriguing characters and enticingly mellow pacing that reflects the story's setting.
m/sweet_sixteen, Outstanding film making and the director's best film in years.
m/sweet_smell_of_success," A lean, mean amorality tale that still goes down like a cookie laced with arsenic."
m/sweet_vengeance," A handsomely designed, occasionally funny but ultimately empty female vengeance yarn."
m/sweet_virginia_2017, Director Jaime M. Dagg brews an atmosphere of restrained loves and swelling hurt that carries his slow-burn neo-Western with mesmerizing mood and dizzying emotion.
m/sweetest_thing, Most of the movie is as dead as a blind date with a corpse.
m/sweetheart," I think that this movie has enough ""jump scares,"" and interesting visuals to keep most people entertained."
m/sweethearts-of-the-prison-rodeo," Throughout, the film circles around the sociological significance of the rodeo."
m/sweetie," It's hard to sum up Sweetie, which happens to be one of the movie's strengths."
m/sweetness_in_the_belly," Despite its flaws, Sweetness in the Belly stands as a solid, emotionally driven drama that covers a variety of complicated topics."
m/swept_away, At once too simple and too convoluted to truly take off.
m/swerve_2012," In the end, Swerve, doesn't seem to be about anything other than its own mechanics. And that gets tedious very quick."
m/swimfan," A waterlogged version of 'Fatal Attraction' for the teeny-bopper set...a sad, soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads."
m/swimmer, Burt Lancaster is superb in his finest performance.
m/swimming_pool," At the press conference for Swimming Pool, the wondrous Ozon is asked ""How many women will you put in your film next time?"" ""I will think about it"", he laughs."
m/swimming_with_men," Swimming With Men is let down by slight characterisation, by-the-numbers plotting and heavy-handed jokes that desperately need arm bands. A missed opportunity."
m/swimming_with_sharks," Sharks is a one-joke movie, and the joke wears thin less than halfway through."
m/swing," A slight, silly musical fantasy with two left feet."
m/swing_1999," Incompetent, overlong, pointless, and the only film I've seen that thinks a keyboard is a brass instrument"
m/swing_kids," There are moments here where the movie seems to believe Hitler was bad, not because he mapped genocidal madness, but because he wouldn't let the Swing Kids dance all night."
m/swing_shift," Swing Shift isn't boring, but nothing in it startles, nothing explodes."
m/swing_vote, A Shirley Temple movie camouflaged as political Capra-corn.
m/swingers," Jon Favreau has created what amounts to a comedy with a National Geographic twist, a charming, almost documentary account of the habits of the North American human male in the wild."
m/swinging_safari, Is this outrageous comedy sexy or revolting? Elliott proves - though this feels like the least of his achievements - that a film can be both.
m/swinging_with_the_finkels," You wouldn't wish the supporting cast on a film made by your worst enemy. They include the dad from the sixth Beethoven movie (yeah - somehow they got him), Angus Deayton with his bum hanging out, the mummified remains of Jerry Stiller."
m/swiped_2018," Swiped is a satire that misses the mark, and comes across as a rather dated look at relationships and the differences between men and women."
m/swiss_army_man," Frenzied, kinetic filmmaking is hit or miss, but The Daniels are showcasing their talents as opposed to showing off."
m/switchback," Switchback plays as entertaining, if not quite classic, dramatic fare."
m/switchblade_sisters," A nifty little movie, full of all the lurid teases, off-the-cuff production values, and trenchant topicality that make exploitation movies the fascinating cultural time capsules and filmmaking treasures that they are."
m/swoon," An impressive debut feature from the young, independent American film-maker Tom Kalin."
m/sword_in_the_stone, The songs are so-so and the messages in the picture feel like an after school special instead of part of the story.
m/sword_master," Bringing it all back to basics is a laudable goal, but it should never feel this boring."
m/sword_of_trust," Even as the narrative fizzles, the movie remains an appealing assemblage of timely themes."
m/sword_of_vengeance," There is a brutal simplicity to the action that will appeal to some, but in terms of non-violent content Sword of Vengeance seems stretched even for a relatively short film."
m/swordfish, Failing miserably on so many levels that it really was just a sad movie going experience overall.
m/sx_tape_2014," Even though the film ultimately gives viewers two different stories merged into one (not unlike the inchoate forms in Jill's paintings), it still somehow just feels repetitive and uneconomic."
m/sydney_white, A mildly fractured fairy tale that's often too dopey for its own good.
m/sylvia_scarlett, Grant gives one of his most energetic and best film performances ever.
m/sympathy-for-the-devil-one-+-one, The politics are as muddled as the art is (deliberately?) amateurish.
m/sympathy_for_delicious," Mark Ruffalo's directorial debut spoofs religious fervour and rock-star excesses, but lead actor Christopher Thornton's muddled screenplay struggles to hit its targets."
m/sympathy_for_lady_vengeance," The flashiest, funniest, and most baroque of the ""Vengeance Trilogy."" It is also the most simpleminded and, despite that, eventually the most muddled."
m/sympathy_for_mr_vengeance_2002, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is so badly told that it ends up dissecting a corruption that exudes from nowhere but itself.
m/synchronicity_2016," Flaws keeps ""Synchronicity"" from rising above its limitations to become something great, and that may prevent some people from embracing it, but, there's a goofy charm to the entire film that ultimately makes it feel like a success."
m/synecdoche_new_york," Even critics of this surreal postmodern narrative will acknowledge the rich female roles played by the best actresses today: Catherine Keener, Emily Watson, Dianne Wiest, Michelle Williams, Hope Davis, Samantha Morton, Jennifer Jason Leigh."
m/syriana, What Syriana feels like is a television miniseries condensed into two hours.
m/system_crasher, Systemsprenger's nuances elevate the film beyond mere misery porn and into something truly cathartic.
m/t2_trainspotting," It has the same punchy energy, the same defiant pessimism, and there's nothing around like this. This sequel was a high-wire act, but Boyle has made it to the other side."
m/ta_ra_rum_pum," In its utter sincerity, it has an old-fashioned appeal that may not be for everybody but could definitely play in Peoria."
m/table_19," I won't say it's impossible to make a good movie in which June Squibb plays a rapping granny, but it certainly adds to the degree of difficulty."
m/tabloid_2010," Morris clearly invested so much time and energy in McKinney's story because he saw her as emblematic of our crazed times. Others might wonder whether the sad saga deserves quite this much attention, but there's no denying the film's morbid fascination."
m/tadpole," Shot in just two weeks with a hand-held digital camera, the movie often looks frayed around the edges. Yet it has a soulful heart and a clear grasp of its rarefied milieu."
m/tae_guk_gi_the_brotherhood_of_war," In the rare moments when a rifle, grenade, howitzer, bayonet, dagger, fist, land mine, or flamethrower isn't being deployed, the film pushes its melodramatic plotline with soap operatic shamelessness."
m/tag_2018, A nostalgic walk down Memory Lane courtesy of the ultimate game of Tag. You're it!
m/tai_chi_zero, It feels less like a film and more like a teaser with an abundance of incidental pleasures.
m/tail_lights_fade," Sure, it's a misfire, and that's a shame because the genus of something good is present."
m/tailor_of_panama, It's more like Harry's handmade suits--specially made for the person of taste.
m/take_every_wave_the_life_of_laird_hamilton," Hamilton's story is so filled with dramatic incident and personal and psychological complexity, not to mention spectacular visuals of waves upward of 100 feet tall, that it compels attention whether surfing means anything to you or not."
m/take_me_home_tonight," Take Me Home Tonight is a pleasant-enough all-in-one-night comedy, featuring a protagonist facing the classic Graduate-like existential dilemma of post-college paralysis."
m/take_me_out_to_the_ballgame, A lazy Technicolored cinemusical aimed squarely and accurately at the summer box office.
m/take_me_to_the_river_2014," This indulgent, star-studded documentary about Memphis music is more over-enthusiastic jam session than film."
m/take_me_to_the_river_2016," ""Take Me To The River"" is ultimately about dark family secrets coming up out of the murky weeds. But those expecting these enigmas to break the water's surface with clarity might want to look elsewhere."
m/take_shelter, There's absolutely nothing affected about the film's perspective.
m/take_the_lead," [Take the Lead] hits all its marks, but never dazzles anyone with its footwork."
m/take_this_waltz," For 90% of the film, I thought I knew what TAKE THIS WALTZ was up to, before Polley pulled the carpet out from under me in the final act- and bless her for that!"
m/take_your_pills, The doping allegations against Bradley Wiggins earlier this week have made Take Your Pills especially timely.
m/taken," Widescreen package is technically slick at all levels, and ditto the action choreography, in a cartoonish way."
m/taken_2_2012," This is an expensive and lazy rehash that either doesn't understand what made its predecessor popular, or doesn't care."
m/taken_3," The third and presumably final installment of the Liam Neeson action franchise is a mind-numbing, crash-bang misfire."
m/takers," This is sloppy stuff -- a B-movie in the less complimentary sense of the term, where you occasionally get the sense that people weren't trying all that hard."
m/taking_care_of_business," Oh, what a couple of seasoned stars can do with a formula."
m/taking_lives, A serial killer yarn whose taste and story structure appeals more to mental fascination than to a dependence on baser attractions.
m/taking_sides_le_cas_furtwangler, Director Istvan Szabo and Oscar-winning writer Ronald Harwood have fashioned a potent drama from Harwood's play.
m/taking_woodstock," Even with the ever-versatile Ang Lee behind the camera, this messy historical fiction plays like a two hour ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch, and not a very good one, either."
m/talaash," Ultimately the movie's many strands come together for a final twist, but it's too little too late for this regrettably mediocre Bollywood import."
m/tale_of_despereaux, The magic is -cule in this handsome-looking but drearily told animated tale.
m/tale_of_tales, It is enchanting in parts but falls far short of becoming their sum.
m/talent_given_us," It would all amount to little more than an uncomfortable hour and a half of dirty laundry if it weren't for the natural charm of Allen and Judy Wagner, nonactors who nevertheless project an unexpected amount of charisma."
m/talented_mr_ripley," While The Talented Mr. Ripley may not quite qualify as a masterpiece of suspense, it certainly is the most skilled, engrossing homage to Alfred Hitchcock in ages."
m/tales_from_the_crypt_presents_bordello_of_blood," For a horror-comedy film to work, it's got to be both funny and scary. Tales From the Crypt Presents Bordello of Blood is neither."
m/tales_from_the_crypt_presents_demon_knight," The problem here is clearly the script, with very little that is original and amusing."
m/tales_from_the_golden_age," The film has been crisply shot, its static set-ups by turns inventively forlorn and bracingly comic."
m/tales_from_the_hood, Both fails to be the witty satire that it was promoted as being and the serious scarefest it actually aspires to be.
m/tales_from_the_script," One of Tales' strongest points is made accidentally: Its huge cast of interviewees consists of one Asian speaker, one Latino, three African-Americans, and five women - one of whom pulls double-duty as a woman of color."
m/tales_of_the_night," Shot through with romance and glimpses of the kind of silly humour that made A Town Called Panic (2009) so popular, children and adults should be kept quite happy by this solid, intelligent family film."
m/talk_of_the_town," Though verbose, this darkly humorous film benefits from star power of Cary Grant in atypical role, some witty dialogue, and timely subject matter."
m/talk_radio," [Eric Bogosian] is what makes Talk Radio worth seeing, and he is what you'll be talking about afterward."
m/talk_to_her," At heart, it's a sick, scandalous joke, but you can't quite bring yourself to laugh at something so deeply felt and so gravely elegant."
m/talk_to_me," Exhilarating! I say, 'Bring back the sixties' (- the Vietnam War)."
m/tall_blond_man_with_one_black_shoe," Well, it isn't comedy of the highest order, but most of it is thoroughly winning."
m/tall_girl," From a one-note mean girl stereotype to a complete disinterest in how social media shapes the lives of teens, Sam Wolfson's lackluster script fails to bring anything new or timely to the teen rom-com table."
m/tall_t," The Tall T has some of the best sequences in the ""Ranown"" series."
m/tall_tale," The story, told with energy and humor, is aimed at family audiences, and should appeal to all but the smallest of children."
m/talladega_nights_the_ballad_of_ricky_bobby," Rambunctious and synthetic, Talladega Nights boasts its fair share of inspired Ferrell riffs, even if, as a satire of the NASCAR subculture, it mostly runs on fumes."
m/tallulah," The main problem with the movie is that Tallulah, who is meant to be roguishly charming, is instead irritating - a lying, thieving, tiresome, unwashed hippie moocher ..."
m/tamara, Survives solely on the repetitive pleasures of genre.
m/tamara_drewe_2010," The deadly sins of envy, lust and salacious gossip in deepest rural England provide the motor for Stephen Frears's black romp, featuring vivacious former Bond girl Gemma Arterton in the title role of the youthful scribe."
m/tammy_2014, Is this a train wreck for the comedienne or a mere dump in the road?
m/tammys_always_dying, Tammy's Always Dying is about a mother-daughter relationship at its core.
m/tampopo, Tampopo is one of those utterly original movies that seems to exist in no known category.
m/tangerine_2015," Outrageous antics are often the catalyst for moments of pure empathy. The cast, which consists mostly of non-actors, is fantastic and endlessly game."
m/tangerines," Tangerines ends up being serviceably bleak, but rarely compelling."
m/tangled," The romance doesn't match the visual splendor, but no matter: The lushness is enough."
m/tango_and_cash, Movies like this are annoying because they seem to be saying that the audience is made up of morons.
m/tank_girl, The film tries very hard to recreate the comic book's wild and wacky flair and in the end it is a total assault on the senses with deafening rock music interspersed clips of psychedelic animation.
m/tanna_2016," While the story of ""Tanna"" is forgettable, the people are not."
m/tanner-hall, A derivative and unappealing drama about four girls at a boarding school.
m/tao_of_steve, Will woo you into shedding your romantic-comedy fatigue.
m/tap_world," The movie is at its best when Hargrove shows rather than tells. Anyone can appreciate these artists in motion, all of whom prove the infectious appeal of a dance that doesn't just respond to rhythm but creates its own."
m/tape," Intermittently involving but lacking in wit, style and variety."
m/tape_2020, Tape is necessarily excruciating and had me riveted for most of its taut running time.
m/tapeheads, It's the kind of harmless breezy film that's easy to take on late night cable TV when you don't feel like using your noodle.
m/taps," Mildly engaging, but burdened by a predictable climax."
m/targets," Clever, effective combination of gun violence and old-time horror movies."
m/tarzan," Animated to perfection, the film is especially captivating as Tarzan zips through the jungle like he's surfing the tree cover."
m/tarzan_2013," All of this feels awfully simplistic, like a 10-minute cartoon sketch bloated into a full-length movie, and one that's backed by an over-explanatory voiceover that can sometimes sound awkward."
m/tarzan_and_the_lost_city," Not only it is poorly written, badly acted, and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas, it is thoroughly uninspired"
m/tarzan_escapes, Superior Tarzan flick that might have been great before it was censored.
m/taste_of_honey," Freed from the constricting confines of the stage, the shining honesty, the trials, the disenchantment of the drama's low-born Lancashire principals have become all the more striking and true."
m/taste_the_blood_of_dracula, Thematically intriguing %u2014 a sort of broadside attack on Victorian hypocrisy.
m/tater_tot_and_patton," A film so steeped in such deeply human conditions as grief, addiction and loneliness ought not also be such a sweetly engaging joy."
m/tatsumi_2011," Engaging, entertaining and beautifully animated, Tatsumi is a treat for fans and is likely to make converts of newcomers, though it's more successful as a showcase for his stories than as a documentary or biopic."
m/taxi, Taxi can never seem to decide if it's absurd by design or accident.
m/taxi_driver," Its themes of urban decay, anomie and violence which infuse the impending sense of doom at the heart of this film still hang like black clouds over many cities today."
m/taxi_to_the_dark_side," It's about what we have done (or at least allowed to be done in our name), why we should be ashamed and angry, and whether we have the honor and decency to stop it. If America still has a soul, Alex Gibney is trying to save it."
m/tchoupitoulas," Shooting in what sometimes approximates a semi-inebriated haze, and emphasizing the overlapping of diverse sounds coming from different quarters, Tchoupitoulas almost does manage to transcend the sight and sound limitations of cinema."
m/tea_with_the_dames," ut despite ""Mags"" and ""Jude"" sometimes living up to their cantankerous reputations, this isn't an all-star episode of Grumpy Old Women. Instead, it's an absorbing and fascinating look back at the last 60 years of British stage and screen."
m/teacher_2019, Teacher will break your heart as much as it will make your heart race.
m/teachers_pet_2004," I can't imagine kids embracing it, nor can I see adults shelling out the cash to see it on their own. I kinda liked it."
m/teaching_mrs_tingle, Contains enough amusing moments and unpredictable twists for the film to score with teen audiences.
m/team_america_world_police," All told, the clever visual bits and hilarious songs don't entirely compensate for the many flat or beyond-over- the-top spells."
m/tears_of_the_black_tiger, Gives you some idea of what would happen if Ang Lee and John Woo were asked to make a cartoon together.
m/tears_of_the_sun," An imminent favorite at the White House screening room, but the film is ultimately so dry and remote that one can't imagine Chaney or Ashcroft trooping through all the exposition and moral finagling to get to the carnage."
m/ted_2," Bad taste needs to be more honest and more all-inclusive if it's to make a lasting impression, and MacFarlane's bad taste here is both too wishy-washy and too knee-jerk cruel to really make any impact."
m/ted_2012," [A] predictably irreverent satire that's sweeter and, sadly, less funny than you might expect."
m/ted_bundy," This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is, quite frankly, an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast."
m/teddy_bear_2012," From its title to its closing caress, Teddy Bear skates perilously close to the cliff's edge of mawkish sentiment."
m/teen_beach_movie," It's too bad the makers didn't do a slightly better job casting the key roles, but taken on its own terms the 95-minute Disney Channel original plays like a brightly colored beach blanket, albeit one that's a little rough around its sandy edges."
m/teen_spirit_2019," If you haven't had enough underdog tales about kids from the wrong side of the tracks trying to make it big, Max Minghella's directorial debut Teen Spirit hits all the usual check marks to provide a stylish if familiar entry to the theme."
m/teen_titans_go_to_the_movies," Teen TitansGo! to the Movies will delight audiences of all ages and remind us of the value of friendship, waffles, and superbly delivered jokes about the entertainment industry."
m/teen_titans_the_judas_contract," Although it's only the second DC animated film to see release this year, Teen Titans: The Judas Contract is undoubtedly a serious contender for being the best when 2017 is said and done."
m/teen_witch," The unapologetic cheesiness and truly awful values of ""Teen Witch"" is often so bad, and yet so damn charming to endure."
m/teen_wolf," The anecdotal happenings in the film are insignificant, because in theme Teen Wolf offers an unparalleled analysis of puberty, adolescence, and the all-to-familiar search for popularity in teenage film."
m/teenage-paparazzi," Teenage Paparazzo is a personal, point-of-view doc from Adrian Grenier, the star of HBO's Entourage, who shows there's an inquiring mind behind the pretty-boy charm."
m/teenage_2013," Doesn't tell us all that much, but full of loving grace, nonetheless. A teenage dream, indeed."
m/teenage_badass," Teenage Badass will not set your world on fire, but its empathetic characters, sense of rhythm, knowledge of band jargon, and, most importantly, its music are sure to at least warm your heart."
m/teenage_cocktail, Teenage Cocktail is a quality film that goes well beyond an entertaining high school romance and makes a lasting impression by highlighting the overwhelming power of blinding passion.
m/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_2013," There's no angst in this new franchise, no elaborate metaphor and no ambition to speak of. And although you could argue that that is in and of itself a problem, at least it smoothes out Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' many, many flaws."
m/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_2_the_secret_of_the_ooze," Didn't seem quite as good as the first -- at least, in terms of reproducing the atmosphere of the original."
m/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii, Even kids are likely to respond to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III with less enthusiasm than they did to the first two films in this series.
m/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_out_of_the_shadows," Considerably better than its predecessor, the central four may give it their all but the people behind this franchise sadly don't seem all that interested in their crime-fighting, pizza-eating heroes."
m/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_the_movie, Cowabunga!! Try making turtle soup out of these butt-kicking raucous reptiles. It's pure giddy excitement!
m/tees_maar_khan_2010," The screenwriters manage to redeem Khan; but it's not quite enough to save the movie, which, given the velocity of the frantic action, should have played brisk and buoyant."
m/teeth, Teeth is a solid first effort that makes you extremely curious about the filmmaker's next project.
m/tehran_taboo," The movie's intertwining stories are engrossing, with Pari the standout character."
m/tekken," Part Hunger Games, part tournament fighter film, part faithful game adaptation, part completely incorrect game adaptation: the film is a mess, but can still be entertaining..."
m/tekkonkinkreet, The movie is a collection of disparate anime parts that never really comes together.
m/teknolust, 'A' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy.
m/tel_aviv_on_fire," Ultimately, Tel Aviv On Fire never transcends the schlocky conventions it attempts to satirize. It's yet another reminder that even the most explosive material can be made to feel utterly harmless."
m/tell_it_to_the_bees," Tell It to the Bees may serve its characters unearned exploitation, but its multi-layered central performances and fastidious sense of time and place allow moments of truth to shine."
m/tell_me_that_you_love_me_junie_moon," All this is well mounted and lensed but sans the right dramatic flourishes to get human depth, melodramatic gusto or humane symbolism into the right focus."
m/tell_me_who_i_am," By focusing so narrowly on the Lewis brothers' relationship with their mother, the film inadvertently minimizes the scope of their abuse."
m/telling_lies_in_america," While the elements in this coming-of-age saga may seem familiar...Eszterhas brings a fresh, immigrant's-eye perspective to his tale."
m/telstar_the_joe_meek_story, Fairly crackles with character and period flavor for its first 90 minutes but is let down by a repetitive and tiresomely maudlin final half-hour.
m/temp," As another entry in the 'don't-trust- anyone' paranoia thrillers that have taken over the fright genre of late, The Temp is one of the dumbest."
m/tempest," Just another example of middling, muddled Shakespeare."
m/temple_grandin," Most impressively, Danes gets past the tics of her character -- an autistic woman who ""thinks in pictures"" -- to create the sort of memorable portrait that frequently yields gilded ornaments as a lovely parting gift."
m/temptation_2013, Limp pacing and countless shots of Washington's skyline plague the narrative.
m/ten_thousand_saints_2015," Heart-warming, funny, and real, which means at times it can be desperately sad, this is a fantastic new development for Springer Berman and Pulcini. This one's going to go far."
m/ten_to_midnight," ...a routine police thriller that is, for the most part, slow moving and uneventful."
m/tenacious_d_in_the_pick_of_destiny," It's hard to complain too much about this loosey-goosey romp's patchiness when one of the rocking songs features the lyric ""You're gonna gargle mayonnaise""...and the reference isn't to Hellman's."
m/tenant," The Tenant is Polanski at his funniest, and its humor is premised on its excess. You can think of it as a staring contest where your opponent is dressed in wild drag."
m/tender_mercies," Remarkable film about a country western singer, a widow, and her son who try to expel the shadows of the past in order to become strong in the broken places of their lives."
m/tenderness_of_the_wolves, Lommel's film remains as disturbing a look at a serial killer as you're likely to see.
m/tequila_sunrise," The set-up has the precision of fine needlepoint, picking out the plot outline before embroidering it with a complex pattern of interwoven relationships."
m/terminal_2018," Undoubtedly one of 2018's best looking films. It's visually stunning with mesmerizing cinematography, but lacks enough substance to match its dazzling looks."
m/terminal_velocity," You've gotta hand it to Terminal Velocity: This movie may be dumb as a box of shredded wheat, but it has the damnedest action sequence I've seen since Arnold Schwarzenegger blasted the bad guy with the missile in True Lies."
m/terminator," The movie's strength is that, like The Matrix, it combines action with ideas."
m/terminator_2_judgment_day," Nobody, I think, will complain that it doesn't have enough action."
m/terminator_3_rise_of_the_machines, What has always made the Terminator movies stand out from other sci-fi/action flicks is the human drama and the fight against one's fate.
m/terminator_4," Darker, grimmer and more stylistically single-minded than its two relatively giddy predecessors, ""Terminator Salvation"" boasts the kind of singular vision that distinguished the James Cameron original."
m/terminator_dark_fate, Maybe no one needs to try to make another Terminator movie so soon now that we have another halfway decent one?
m/terminator_genisys," The film just lumbers along, often tediously; there's no sense that the scenario has been carefully kneaded, structured and shaped by attentive dramatists. Visually, we've seen these images, or many like them, so many times before ..."
m/terms_and_conditions_may_apply," Apart from its shallow analysis,Terms And Conditions is, if anything, not alarmist enough."
m/terms_of_endearment," Its soppy story is freed from cheap tear-jerking by Brooks' confident direction, Larry McMurtry's poignant script and a flawless ensemble."
m/terraferma_2011," As ""Terraferma"" tightens its focus on a courageous resolution of tough issues, too much nuance is jettisoned along the way."
m/terri_2011, Another coming-of-age Sundance flick about a lovable outcast who comes to appreciate his own individuality with the help of an oddball authority figure? Yes. But a good one.
m/terribly_happy," A polished, entertaining affair that spins off in unexpected directions."
m/terrifier," Thornton stays in rôle as fun-loving mime artist, so that all his slayings involve an unnerving combination of predatory sadism & popular performance. This makes him a perfect vehicle for the paradoxes of horror (as) entertainment."
m/terror_in_a_texas_town," Blistering left wing Western, with unique surreal final showdown."
m/terror_of_mechagodzilla, The most grave and deliberate and consequential Godzilla film in a decade.
m/terror_train," The classic horror films of the 1930s appealed to the intelligence of its audiences, to their sense of humor and irony. Movies like Terror Train... just don't care. They're a series of sensations, strung together on a plot."
m/tesla," It's more noteworthy as an ambitious movie made with intriguingly tight constraints - even if the results, like Tesla's big ideas, don't always work."
m/tess, Tess conveys the bleak determinism that makes this young woman's life so anguished.
m/test_2014," While Test sidesteps perfection in several minor areas, it more than makes up for those weaknesses with the magnetic performance by Matthew Risch as a promiscuous fellow hoofer; the authenticity of the screenplay; and the choreography by Sidra Bell."
m/testament, Powerful depiction of the psychological terror that grips a California community after New York and other cities in the East are destroyed by nuclear bombs.
m/testament_of_youth, It's altogether a tearful experience - as contemplating such irrecoverable losses to a whole generation should be.
m/tetro," Francis Ford Coppola returns to form with his richest, most enrapturing film since Apocalypse Now. The black-and-white cinematography alone is as intoxicating as a bottle of the director's finest red."
m/tetsuo-the-ironman," Filled with wild stop motion effects and brilliant conceptual horrors, this is a horror film for the modern technological world."
m/texas_chainsaw," It is every 16 year-old's rite of passage to sneak into an R-rated slasher, get grossed out by blood, turned on by boobs and shout back at the screen. To that end, 'Texas Chainsaw 3D' is a worthy claimant to the franchise."
m/texas_chainsaw_massacre," Replaces horror with gore, social commentary with carny freaks and black humor with R. Lee Ermy"
m/texas_chainsaw_massacre_2," Gratuitously violent, and none too subtle (it lacks the subversive qualities of the original) it's also undeniably funny, maniacally energetic fare with a liberal smattering of enjoyable set-pieces."
m/texas_chainsaw_massacre_the_next_generation," A hoot to see Matt and Renee, but none of the thrills of the original. Not scary or fun."
m/texas_killing_fields," As solid Saturday night entertainment goes, this is a consistently compelling, enjoyably old school potboiler."
m/thale_2012," Solid work from writer/director Aleksander Nordaas, who shapes a beguiling monster movie without ever truly indulging the tropes that often accompany the chaos."
m/thank_god_its_friday," Forgettable '70s musical fluff, over produced, not that listenable."
m/thank_you_for_playing," Grieving father Ryan Green may be aware that he's performing for the cameras in the moving documentary/character study Thank You for Playing, but his self-conscious behavior never cancels out his apparent sincerity."
m/thank_you_for_smoking, ...a pleasant enough way to kill 92 minutes (although one has to imagine that Buckley's book packed more of a punch than this).
m/thank_you_for_your_service_2017," If living Schumann, Solo and Waller's lives for just a couple hours can raise awareness to the needs of the hundreds of thousands of veterans just like them, that would be the gratitude they deserve."
m/thanks_for_sharing," The film can't quite find its footing as either a drama or a comedy, and near the end it's actively sliding off the rails."
m/tharlo," Issues of identity, clashes of culture and the nitty-gritty of sheep-herding are the themes which drive Tibetan director Pema Tseden's beguiling fable Tharlo."
m/that-touch-of-mink," ""a true antique with Doris and Cary sparring winningly"""
m/that_awkward_moment, A romantic comedy from the perspective of three male friends has the potential to offer something new to the genre but despite one or two comedy highlights That Awkward Moment largely makes a mess of things.
m/that_evening_sun, Complex and fulfilling...a beautifully etched slice of a life that's always compelling.
m/that_man_from_rio," It's fun, in an imperialist, colonialist, patronizing, exotic-marginalized-foreigners way."
m/that_man_peter_berlin," As an interview subject, [Berlin] is by turns arrogant, silly and rather touching."
m/that_night," The movie starts out as half-baked comedy and congeals into hard-baked melodrama, with Aice delivering narration through it all like an insufferable tour guide."
m/that_obscure_object_of_desire," One of the director's later works, That Obscure Object of Desire, examines the puzzle of sexual politics."
m/that_sugar_film," Simply put, Gameau's one-man experiment is not rigorous enough to prove anything at all, however striking his results seem."
m/that_summer_2018," This footage is more incidental, less mysterious and revelatory than in Grey Gardens. But, still, it's more of the Edies, which makes it priceless."
m/that_thing_you_do," In short, this is a lightweight but utterly loveable affair which proves Hanks is as assured behind the camera as in front of it."
m/thats-entertainment-iii," In some ways, it is not a third installment in the That's Entertainment! series as much as it is a parallel history of the MGM musical."
m/thats_entertainment," That's Entertainment! cannot and is not a substitute for seeing the musicals themselves, in their entirety."
m/thats_entertainment_part_2," It's more fluid, with fewer interruptions of the material, and several segments cover purely speaking segments rather than just song and dance."
m/thats_my_boy_2012," Funny is some spots, idiotic in others and a combination of both during its moments of raunchy insanity, That's My Boy is a suitably moronic entry into the canon of Adam Sandler's man-child comedies."
m/thats_what_i_am," Agreeable, uplifting and earnest almost to a fault."
m/thats_what_she_said_2012," A word of advice to all those women out there bent on making the definitive chick flick revenge, raunchier than thou female Hangover movie. Knock it off, enough already. And that goes for those self-hating sexpots in their own mind inhabiting them too."
m/the-5000-fingers-of-dr-t, I recommend it to people of all ages IF they can be young at heart.
m/the-9th-company," It's beautifully shot and includes bravura set pieces from the front line. Unsurprisingly, it ends badly."
m/the-actress-1953," Ruth Gordon's memoirs of her New England girlhood have been turned into a warm, funny movie."
m/the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl-in-3d," Pure Robert Rodriguez creativity, bordering on insanity, but definitely something different. Give him credit. Robert Rodriguez sure knows how to switch gears."
m/the-baby1973, You may find yourself giggling with disbelief or maybe just embarrassment
m/the-backyard," An x-treme documentary, as riveting as a road accident and a lot more bloody."
m/the-best-and-the-brightest, The Best and the Brightest should be called The Worst and the Dumbest.
m/the-blue-tooth-virgin," Simultaneously insightful and idiotic, the minimalist pic features a succession of experts providing their two cents on Why We Write, the pitfalls of friendship and the need for outside validation."
m/the-bridesmaid," Skilfully adapted from a Ruth Rendell novel and set in a provincial French town, The Bridesmaid is a slyly enjoyable thriller with echoes of Hitchcock's Strangers On A Train."
m/the-cake-eaters," An old-fashioned minor key drama, ""The Cake Eaters"" is the exact type of film that is the cornerstone of modern American Independent cinema."
m/the-cheetah-girls-2," While the Cheetah Girls' ""credo"" gives lip service to friendship and support and commitment, they spend an awful lot of time simply wanting to be superstar divas."
m/the-company-men," A shrewd, timely, and terrifically engrossing drama of white-collar reckoning that marks the feature directorial debut of writer-producer John Wells."
m/the-crimson-kimono-1959," Beyond the preponderance of sweaty close-ups and rat-a-tat-tat cutting in Fuller's films, his peacetime cinema views relationships as a string of tribal skirmishes."
m/the-croods," Ploughing this coming-of-age furrow is fine, though The Croods hardly does it with any sophistication, preferring to wow us with hyperkinetic action."
m/the-debut2000, A creakily familiar take on an age-old family dynamic.
m/the-desert-of-forbidden-art," An unusual and fascinating documentary about the survival of avant-garde art in the Soviet Union thanks to the courage, imagination, and zeal of one collector."
m/the-eagle-of-the-ninth," Evoking the forgotten meanings of action-adventure films (pre-Tarantino) is enough to make The Eagle a distinctive, if minor, film."
m/the-evil-dead, To say that the Evil Dead movies are not for everyone is an understatement. A strong stomach is required.
m/the-fall-2008," Tarsem and his screenwriting collaborators aren't able to come up with enough interesting justifications for their sudden shifts, and soon the shape-shifting yarn just feels like lazy storytelling."
m/the-family-that-preys," Overstuffed and self-indulgent...The Family That Preys is nothing more than a busy-minded, shifty soap opera propelled by its empty-minded sense of indignation."
m/the-fantasticks, The musical scenes in The Fantasticks crackle with intimacy.
m/the-food-of-the-gods," Back in her glory days at Warner Bros., Ida Lupino never could have imagined that a movie role would require her to wring her hands, bug her eyes and make this fervent prayer: 'I won't never sin again, never. Only don't let no rat eat us, please, God!'"
m/the-foot-fist-way," Trouble is, the gags just keep finding new ways to make McBride's strip-mall sensei seem pathetic, and the few scattered laughs never justify the cruelty."
m/the-gods-must-be-crazy," The film's initial sequences, in which the simple, no- nonsense manners and mores of the bushmen are shown on the screen accompanied by rather coy voice-over narration, are terribly patronizing."
m/the-great-mouse-detective," ...intended mainly for kids, most audiences, young and old, will get a kick out of it. ...the film is entertaining in its own low-key manner."
m/the-heart-is-deceitful-above-all-things," If, however, you are willing to take a dark ride you will be rewarded."
m/the-heart-of-the-game," Given so many narrative strands%u2014Resler's peculiar coaching philosophies, the drawn-out eligibility battle, Russell's problems coping with school and personal demons, and the team's annual push for the state championship%u2014director Ward Serrill cho"
m/the-hero-of-color-city," A weak Toy Story-esque animated film for preschool kids made with little imagination, little art, and even less soul."
m/the-killing-of-john-lennon," This tells us precisely nothing about John Lennon and a sight too much about his killer, Mark Chapman."
m/the-knack-and-how-to-get-it," Everything about the film feels genuine and uncalculated, and it finally comes across as one joyous celebration of life and of being alive."
m/the-last-run-1971," In any guise, George C. Scott is worth watching, though his performance here seems haunted by the same tedious resignation that atrophies the script."
m/the-left-handed-gun," A close, inspired study of Ford and Nicholas Ray, and a decisive source of inspiration to Peckinpah, Malick, and Penn himself, who looked at it again and saw Bonnie and Clyde."
m/the-man," ""The Man's"" nebulous title indicates the sloppy nature of an ""action comedy"" movie that emits painfully little of either genre enticement."
m/the-missing-gun, Offbeat film about a cop struggling for self-respect
m/the-navigator, One of the great slapstick comedies from silent comic Buster Keaton.
m/the-next-man, The Next Man emerges more a slick travesty with political overtones than the cynical suspense meller it was designed to be.
m/the-nutcracker1993," Kistler is cold and emotionless, but the dancing is euphoric"
m/the-passenger-professione-reporter," The Passenger is not only a great Hollywood movie, it's a great movie in world cinema."
m/the-perfect-host, So many engaging twists that any attempt at a detailed synopsis would ruin the movie.
m/the-pleasure-of-being-robbed, Affects an air of expressionistic realism but has no interest in actual believability.
m/the-resident," No matter how loud the tension chord, The Resident is funnier than it is frightening."
m/the-romantics," [It plays] as an elementary game of who-gets-who musical chairs, involving nasty behavior among pretty and thoroughly unconvincing aesthetes."
m/the-safety-of-objects, Deserving of notice if only for a few exceptional performances and some very fine editing work and cinematography.
m/the-scenesters, This jumbled satirical mystery is too pleased with itself for its own good.
m/the-scent-of-green-papaya, The romance does not develop until late in this deliberate but surprisingly beautiful film by Vietnam's Tran Anh Hung.
m/the-secret-of-kells," Majestic animation fails to conjure a sense of enchantment in The Secret of Kells, a beautiful two-dimensional work devoid of dramatic vigor."
m/the-secret-of-roan-inish," Not so much a children's film as an adult film in which the children and animals are graceful presences, this is a charming, genuinely moving gem."
m/the-sicilian-girl, A mediocre entry in the Cosa Nostra canon and a waste of an extraordinary true story.
m/the-singles-ward," A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward: Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs. And neither do cliches, no matter how 'inside' they are."
m/the-social-network, A sharply written tale expressing the irony that a man with five hundred million subscribers has nary a friend in the world.
m/the-tale-of-zatoichi," Falls somewhere between the stoic ultra-badness of Lone Wolf and Cub's Ogami Itto, and the sarcastic but good-hearted Yojimbo ... Samurai fans may rejoice"
m/the-taqwacores," Love or loathe the go-your-own-way message, you still end up with a simplistic religious reclamation folded into the celluloid equivalent of Xeroxed zine."
m/the-tigger-movie, The Tigger Movie has real substance in addition to the silliness.
m/the-trotsky," The Trotsky is an endearing comedy that at times flirts with greatness, and those times are courtesy of Jay Baruchel's performance."
m/the-vanishing-of-the-bees, Of course something has to change. But let's start with the eco-doc format.
m/the-war-on-the-war-on-drugs, Ineptitude is so thorough here that War on . . . could only make sense as a sinister governmental smear campaign to justify the war on drugs and total sobriety.
m/the-war1994, It's impossible to tell whom this movie was made for. Even William Bennett would have trouble staying awake.
m/the-warriors-way," There isn't a shred of subtlety in their clowning -- or in any part of the movie, which clumsily shoots for operatic highs and lows. But with so many borrowed bits and pieces, the only feeling it successfully evokes is déjà vu."
m/the-wide-blue-road," I like to make films in which the difficulty of the human condition comes out, because I have a great love for humans and their plight."
m/the-wild-and-wonderful-whites-of-west-virginia, ... a slow-motion human train wreck that ... the audience just can't turn away from.
m/the-yakuza1975, There are enough double-crosses to satisfy the most jaded fans of the genre.
m/the_1000000_duck," An amusing anecdote about a hardy duck who lays golden eggs, which is lifted clear out of the ordinary by a comedienne named Sandy Duncan."
m/the_100_year_old_man_who_climbed_out_the_window_and_disappeared," This picaresque European fantasy has an element of knockabout black comedy that can't conceal its Sweet'N Low taste of sentimentality and whimsy, and a certain condescension towards old people."
m/the_10th_victim," [T]he original Survivor set in a near future of unlikely fashions and pop-art stylings, where comic books are the literature of the day, murder games have become the dominant form of media entertainment, and war has been replaced by The Big Hunt."
m/the_12th_man," ""The 12th Man"" is a polished crowd-pleaser, with a timeless message: Nazis suck."
m/the_1517_to_paris, This isn't just a train wreck. It's the sound of Clint Eastwood's career death knell.
m/the_24_hour_war," Seriously Ford-centric remembrance of ""the greatest rivalry in (endurance) racing,"" Ford vs. Ferrari in the 1960s."
m/the_24th, Trai Byers leads a solid cast in this true story that ably illuminates a dark episode in American history.
m/the_33," As the film runs can be perceived the politically correct proposal, some surreal shots, but never gets the emotions collide. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/the_9th_life_of_louis_drax," The 9th Life Of Louis Drax is a tonal timebomb waiting to explode, but it bursts too early and bombards audiences with a clashing array of conflicting visions."
m/the_abandoned_2016," Two second-act revelations alter its tired dynamic for the better, but those changes are undone by cheap scares and a climactic revelation that's more ho-hum than horrifying."
m/the_abcs_of_death," I'm a big fan of giving artists certain ""obstructions"" (to borrow from Von Trier) and see what they can come up with, yet the results of this particular experiment are mixed at best."
m/the_absent_one," Although each of the first three films tells a full, discrete story, they work best cumulatively, as the ongoing adventures of one cranky, conscientious cop."
m/the_accompanist," Writer-director and star Frederick Keeve is introduced to us, weeping at the keyboard in the opening scene. It won't be long before he isn't crying alone."
m/the_accountant_2016," If nothing else, The Accountant will tide us over until Affleck's next stand-alone Caped Crusader adventure, The Batman."
m/the_act_of_killing," The importance of this doco cannot be overstated in exposing a corrupt regime, highlighting the dangers of propaganda and holding a warped mirror to the monsters that walk the Earth as free men"
m/the_addams_family_2019," It may not grab the old fans, but it does open it up to a new younger audience that holds allegiance to no camp."
m/the_adderall_diaries, It's too busy skipping through subplots to do much more than gloss over such heady issues as the fundamental subjectivity of truth and self-identity.
m/the_adventurer_the_curse_of_the_midas_box," ""This is horrible!"" Sacha the seamstress says. ""I have to get out of here!"" She stole the thoughts right out of my brain as I watched Jonathan Newman's dismally directed, inert action movie The Adventurer: Curse of the Midas Box."
m/the_adventurers_2017, Poor scripting and a serious lack of energy make this passable fun at best.
m/the_adventures_of_buckaroo_banzai," The best thing about a movie this wilfully silly is that it never patronizes its audience for loving it and in the end, that might be the best reason for giving it a chance."
m/the_adventures_of_bullwhip_griffin," It's not high art (and it's sure not close to ""classic"" status), but Bullwhip presents some old-fashioned family fun that won't have the grown-ups running for cover."
m/the_adventures_of_tintin," Think of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" as a song of innocence and experience, able to combine a sweet sense of childlike wonder and pureness of heart with the most worldly and sophisticated of modern technology."
m/the_african_queen_1951," And so Mr. Huston merits credit for putting this fantastic tale on a level of sly, polite kidding and generally keeping it there, while going about the happy business of engineering excitement and visual thrills."
m/the_afterlight," Tempering the film's oppressive emotions, the cinematographer Zo White's exquisite compositions charge leaden rain clouds and rustling branches with eerie life, and dusty indoor corners with shadowy secrets."
m/the_aftermath_2019," There's an interesting story to be found somewhere in the darker recesses of The Aftermath, but it tends to be more concerned with the lightweight dalliances of its rather dull central characters to leave any aftermath of its own with the audience."
m/the_age_of_adaline," Stay far away if romantic movies bother you. For everyone else, this very much delivers on its earnest intentions."
m/the_age_of_stupid, Postlethwaite's battered face is a good metaphor for Earth's ravagement. But the film is too overtly left-wing and anti-US to be of inclusive use.
m/the_aggression_scale," The Aggression Scale feels like a cult classic in the making and pretty much has ""midnight movie"" written all over it."
m/the_air_i_breahe, Ignore all of that foolishness and watch the collision of emotions The Air I Breathe provides -- it is enough all by itself to leave you breathless.
m/the_amazing_spider_man," A mostly slick, entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements."
m/the_amazing_spider_man_2," [It] doesn't just double down on what didn't work in the first film, it manages to undo some of the good qualities of the original as well. The result is a film that kicks off the summer blockbuster season with a resounding thud."
m/the_ambassador," a movie whose confusing narrative and at times intriguing parts are at war with each other, and never quite gel."
m/the_american, The flashy visuals tend to say a lot more than the story itself.
m/the_american_meme," But with a clear and mostly unfiltered focus on [its] subjects, The American Meme... shows just how high the pressure to keep up with everyone else truly is."
m/the_american_side," The American Side never quite adds up to a satisfying experience, but that's made up for by the cavalcade of familiar faces in small parts, including Matthew Broderick, Harris Yulin, Robert Forster -- and, most excitingly, Janeane Garofalo."
m/the_american_soldier, This film marks a decisive step towards 'real' Fassbinder: the absurdity of its world of second-hand experience invests every clich with a meaning it never had before.
m/the_amityville_horror," It once seemed creepy, but time has made it seem pretty contrived."
m/the_amityville_murders, Surely there are more interesting ways to scare the pants off people.
m/the_angel," A fascinating tale, delivered with just enough suspense to make it engrossing without feeling over the top."
m/the_angels_share, Loach and Laverty never fully resolve the yin and yang: the blood and the banter. But it's still rewarding to see these filmmakers exploring a different ton.
m/the_angriest_man_in_brooklyn, Watching The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is about as much fun as repeatedly punching yourself in the face.
m/the_angry_birds_movie," A fast, fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that, at its zenith, had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens."
m/the_angry_birds_movie_2," Adults and kids will both enjoy it immensely because that solid characterisation, humour and sense of fun consistently shine through."
m/the_anomaly, Once you've worked out that the plot is even more ridiculous than you feared there's not much to hold your interest.
m/the_anonymous_people," Heartfelt and provocative, but not thorough or well-rounded enough."
m/the_anthropologist, A highly human look at a single mother field scientist and her teenage daughter as they globetrot to study the effects of climate change.
m/the_apostate_2016, A very original and suggestive film. [Full review in Spanish]
m/the_apparition," The bare-bones framework of an utterly generic horror story, devoid of thrills, jolts or even an interesting hook."
m/the_apparition_2018," Come for Lindon, stay for young female newcomer, Galatéa Bellugi."
m/the_arbor_2010," It's a powerful story, but muddled by the nagging distraction of having these voices lip-synched by actors."
m/the_archer_2017," Succeeds as a gripping action flick with a bloody conclusion that will leave audiences quietly pumping their fists,"
m/the_ardor, Too bad that Ardor's arrhythmic editing and glacial pacing make it impossible to get lost in its jungles - or to invest in its pseudo-mystical ambiance.
m/the_argument, Viewers who get through a credulity-testing second act may laugh enough in the third to be glad they did.
m/the_armstrong_lie_2013, A quite absorbing but never riveting or revelatory overview of Armstrong's career and testy personality.
m/the_arrangement," The movie finally pounds at our moral sense so much that our moral sense wearies and becomes defensive, and we are finally just grateful for Faye Dunaway's beauty, and the way she doesn't raise her voice."
m/the_art_of_getting_by," Homework is an epitome of the quirky, coming of age trend at Sundance, a hollow but likable enough comedy headed for modest box office."
m/the_art_of_racing_in_the_rain, The film peddles in the simplistic anthropomorphization that's become a hackneyed trope in numerous Hollywood dog-centric movies.
m/the_art_of_self_defense_2019," ""The Art of Self-Defense"" may be presented as an absurdist satire, but like the best American comedies... it doubles as a keen critique of our national character."
m/the_art_of_the_steal," The Art of the Steal is never beautiful, but it's a pleasant enough diversion if you squint a bit or stand far enough back."
m/the_art_star_and_the_sudanese_twins_2008," By the time the circus ends, there is a kind of resolution, a sense of enlightenment after the madness -- and a message that throws the celebrity-adoption frenzy into a complicated new light."
m/the_artist, Casts a spell- right from the first frame. For anyone that truly loves film.
m/the_aspern_papers," ""The Aspern Papers,"" brief as it is, needed more of a lightness of touch; if you weigh down melodrama too much, it dies."
m/the_assassin_2015, It's an indisputable fact that Hou Hsiao-hsien's first wu xia movie The Assassin is an exquisitely beautiful film.
m/the_assignment_2017," Once the giddy critical pile-on and hate-watching settles down, the (justified) moral outrage that (re)Assignment tries to thwart will end up being the regrettable and forgettable film's only lasting legacy."
m/the_atoning_2017," A commendable try at portraying different simultaneous worlds in one film. But, in the end, too ambitious."
m/the_attack_2012, This is not a soft-hearted movie offering quiet hope.
m/the_audition, The Audition becomes a profound and intelligent incursion into the psychology of its characters. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/the_automatic_hate, What begins intriguingly rests increasingly on manufactured suspense.
m/the_autopsy_of_jane_doe," The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a creepy motion picture, festering with atmosphere and frequently very frightening."
m/the_awakening_2011," An enjoyably creepy ghost story heightened by a terrific central performance from Rebecca Hall, though it's slightly let down by an exposition-heavy script and a disappointing finale."
m/the_awakening_of_motti_wolkenbruch," The actors are appealing, but the movie is clichéd from start to finish."
m/the_babadook, The Babadook is the best genre creature creation since the big black wolf-dog aliens from Attack the Block.
m/the_babymakers_2012," Things you do to yourself with one hand: That's a running theme in this movie and, really, the perfect metaphor for the film itself."
m/the_babysitter_2017," For those who seek only the most basic diversion of blood and curvy stimulation, The Babysitter might fit the bill this Friday the 13th, but this intended trashy fun is really just trash."
m/the_bachelors_2017," The Bachelors is a scarcity of a film, one that transcends several genres to create an affecting orotundity through its singular voice."
m/the_backwoods," A decent cast and ok production values get completely lost in The Backwoods, an atmosphere-rich psychological thriller in which psychology and thrills are missing."
m/the_bad_batch," An ambitious, expansive dystopian sci-fi western which features partying, drugs, and cannibals."
m/the_bag_man, Like a bad Tarantino clone from the mid-nineties. Just awful.
m/the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs," Buster Scruggs is a singular illustration of what makes the Coen formula so appealing, and a reminder of so many better examples."
m/the_ballad_of_genesis_and_lady_jaye_2011," Few music documentaries bloom with such lovely, rambunctious energy and singular vision as this."
m/the_ballad_of_lefty_brown," Can be enjoyed as both a straight-shooting homage to crotchety sidekicks and shoot-'em-up conventions, and a well-crafted movie about loyalty, betrayal, and redemption that dutifully acknowledges, without slavishly mimicking ..."
m/the_banana_splits, The Banana Splits Movie is a peculiarly fresh nostalgia trip and has just the right amount of gore to make this otherwise by-the-numbers slasher a surprisingly amusing experience.
m/the_bands_visit, A warm and delightful take on cross-cultural relations that proves that sometimes a light touch is just what's needed to address serious topics.
m/the_banshee_chapter," The twist ending doesn't quite impact as it should, but that is mostly because Erickson's imagery and storytelling has scaled such convincingly offbeat heights up to that point. He is a filmmaker to watch."
m/the_basement_2018," No scary, just excruciating. Shades of ""Saw."" Every ""Saw"" movie. Ever."
m/the_bastards, As black and sticky and inescapable as a tar pit - a movie whose darkness swallows its characters and the audience whole.
m/the_battery, The characters in The Battery never manage to earn anyone's sympathy. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/the_battle_of_algiers," Vital and disquieting, this is a powerful depiction of the pity of war. As shocking today as it was on the day of its release."
m/the_battle_of_jangsari, Kwak is a talented veteran auteur. But he has a tendency to go one step too far in depicting the emotions and dramas of his films.
m/the_battle_of_pussy_willow_creek_2013, Unfunny mockumentary parodying Ken Burns' filmmaking.
m/the_bay_2012," The Bay is Barry Levinson's most engaged and entertaining movie since Wag the Dog, which isn't to say that he's given up his irksome predilection for a certain bullish type of liberalism."
m/the_bay_of_silence," The actors are a pleasure to watch and the European locations add atmosphere, making for solid enough adult entertainment that plays just fine on a home screen."
m/the_baytown_outlaws," It's a shame Battles loses his nerve in the final act, weirdly assuming viewers have developed an emotional attachment to material that works best as a cartoon."
m/the_beach_bum_2019," Like Moondog, Korine finds a vulgar poetry in his own self-indulgence."
m/the_bear_1989," This is not a cute fantasy in which bears ride tricycles and play house. It is about life in the wild, and it does an impressive job of seeming to show wild bears in their natural habitat."
m/the_beast_1975, It's ridiculous; it's tacky; it's pretentious - but it's touched with something comically sublime.
m/the_beast_in_the_cellar, Familiar stuff with the addition of a bit of nastiness and gore; very average.
m/the_beast_with_five_fingers," The animated hand, creepy piano music, and Lorre's eye-popping performance are all memorable."
m/the_beat_beneath_my_feet," The highlights of the entire movie are the imaginative pop-video-style sequences, which make clever use of stop-frame animation to bring the duo's songs to life. If only there was the same vim and vigour elsewhere in this otherwise plodding tale."
m/the_beat_hotel," The Beat Hotel was but one of many domiciles, too small to possess anything but their ephemeral bodies."
m/the_beatles_eight_days_a_week_the_touring_years," We don't learn anything new from The Beatles - Eight Days a Week (besides Whoopi Goldberg's feelings on the Fab Four), but its restored live footage might warrant a ticket to ride."
m/the_beaver_2010," [Mel Gibson] gives remarkable life to a man, and a film, in crisis."
m/the_beguiled, Sofia Coppola has made a modern feminist horror film about the dangers of not allowing your social conditioning to talk louder than your personal feelings.
m/the_believer," Such an incredibly ironic turn of events practically begs to be made into a film, and first-time director Henry Bean guides this one very well."
m/the_belko_experiment," ...a relatively fun effort that works best when viewed with a large, enthusiastic crowd."
m/the_bellmen," Early in the film, we are told that the life of a bellman is all about doing a great job to earn big tips. Well, here's one: next time you want to produce a comedy, make sure it's funny before you let anyone see it."
m/the_benefactor," A wonderful showcase for the actors and little else, Franny was entertaining if not frustrating."
m/the_berlin_file," Everything here, except the action scenes, [feels] sluggish and rote."
m/the_best_exotic_marigold_hotel_2012," Bolstered by the great and the good of homegrown acting royalty, it just about gets away with the fact that Ol Parker's screenplay... at times pushes the humour parlously close to Carry On Up The Elderly."
m/the_best_man_holiday_2013, The Best Man Holiday is an eggnog that's sticky-sweet and heavy at the same time.
m/the_best_of_enemies_2019," No doubt the world needs more paeans to tolerance, but movies as ineffectual as ""The Best of Enemies"" feel profoundly inadequate to the task."
m/the_best_of_me, An opposites-in-love-then-apart-then-back-and-maybe-but-no! weepie seesaw that could test even the most amenable to Sparks-ian heart-tugging.
m/the_best_offer, The film has several smart twists and surprises up its well-tailored sleeve.
m/the_better_angels," The overall effect is close to parody, tinged by a frustrating coyness that refuses to identify its protagonist (Braydon Denney) by name for the entire running time."
m/the_bfg_2016," Exceeds expectations in terms of Rylance's performance, and joyously expounds the essence of a cherished children's tale with imaginative glory and boundless love"
m/the_big_bang_2011, A big disappointment for fans of Antonio Banderas and film noir.
m/the_big_feast," Estranho e por vezes chocante, o filme  rico em simbolismos em sua anlise sobre as frustraes do homem moderno, retratando a degradao de seus personagens atravs da entrega total  realizao dos prazeres da carne (em sentidos literal e figurativo)."
m/the_big_fix, More a summarizing project than an act of investigative journalism or a revelatory indictment.
m/the_big_hangover," Elizabeth Taylor is warm and appealing as the amateur psychiatrist. Van Johnson, too, is rather subdued and serious here, to just as warming effect."
m/the_big_kahuna," The Big Kahuna is best taken as an acting showcase for DeVito (whose low-key, deeply affecting performance is unlike anything he's done before) and Spacey."
m/the_big_lebowski," Nearly everything in The Big Lebowski is a put-on, and all that leaves you with is the Coens' bizarrely over-deliberate, almost Teutonic form of rib nudging."
m/the_big_parade, King Vidor's popular moving antiwar WWI drama set the tone for how to shoot a war film.
m/the_big_picture_2012, A character-driven drama with the soul of an existential thriller that asks more questions than it answers about the nature of identity and the possibility of second chances.
m/the_big_short," McKay approaches this adaptation of Michael Lewis' book with wit, energy and a surprising degree of clarity. But if the movie is a crackerjack entertainment, it's one with a conscience."
m/the_big_sick," 'The Big Sick' is hilarious, surprisingly emotional, and it has a big heart. I can't wait to see it again."
m/the_big_ugly," The preponderance of middle-aged men doesn't help: world-weary, seasoned villains they may be, but you wouldn't bank on any of them breaking into a sprint without pulling something."
m/the_big_wedding_2013," Lines such as, ""Who do you have to lynch for a Cosmo around here?"" pass for a version of humor that only a Mississippi slave owner in 1858 would likely find funny."
m/the_big_year," The movie feels rushed ... and in the process, it solves its minimal conflicts too easily."
m/the_bill_murray_stories_life_lessons_learned_from_a_mythical_man," While the structure of the film grows slightly tedious-the doc provides a fascinating look at celebrity, spontaneity and how technology often prevents us from being present."
m/the_bingo_long_traveling_all_stars_and_motor_kings," Genial, slapdash, high-spirited and occasionally moving."
m/the_birth_of_a_nation_2016," Essential as history and good, not great, as filmmaking."
m/the_bishops_wife, A typically sanctimonious Hollywood Christmas fantasy that works mainly because of the charm of the performers.
m/the_bitter_buddha, An enjoyable lighthearted watch about someone you want to root for to succeed.
m/the_black_cat_1981," This is a decent Fulci film, delivering all the sleaze and some of the splatter you can expect from the Italian goremeister."
m/the_black_godfather_2019," Does yeoman's work introducing a figure that few outsiders have likely heard of, but who needs no introduction in the power corridors of the entertainment industry."
m/the_black_panthers_vanguard_of_the_revolution_2015," Alas, its ultra-conventional, this-then-that approach, peppered with the reminiscences of long-since mellowed talking heads, rarely feels suited to the messy politics and personal lives of Black Panther Party firebrands ..."
m/the_black_power_mix_tape_1967_1975," Like any mixtape, it offers some truly transcendent moments alongside a smattering of filler, and never quite assembles its pieces into a cohesive whole."
m/the_black_string," Its premise isn't the strongest or most original, but [Frankie] Muniz's vanity-free performance in the lead role effortlessly carries this mostly entertaining film from beginning to end."
m/the_blackcoats_daughter," Evoking some unholy cross between the satanic classic Rosemary's Baby and Lucile Hadzihalilovic's uncannily eerie Innocence, with an inky dash of Lost Highway, [Osgood Perkins' film] represents a remarkable debut."
m/the_blackout_experiments," Like Blackout itself, ""The Blackout Experiments"" is often chilling and hard to shake."
m/the_bleeding_edge," Chronicling the unnecessary pain and suffering of patients caused by complications of devices and procedures that received little or no testing, The Bleeding Edge is a terrifying eye-opener."
m/the_bleeding_house, A good-hearted try at a bloody slasher flick falls short of a full pint.
m/the_bling_ring_2013," There is something in Coppola's weightless, affectless portrayal of their crime spree that is very effective, and this is a film whose interest definitely grows on a second viewing."
m/the_blob, Semi-classic 50s sci-fi thanks to McQueen and above par script.
m/the_blob_1988," Great special effects, iconic hairdos, and a lame script, make The Blob a forgettable remake of the classic alien feature. [Full review in Spanish]."
m/the_boat_2018," The film is solid, but it feels resigned to the limitations of its premise rather than actively pushing against its boundaries. Is there anything inherently wrong with that? Not really. Does it make for a safer, more boring film as a result? Undoubtedly."
m/the_body_remembers_when_the_world_broke_open," Tailfeathers and Hepburn give us a grounded interrogation of these topics. Their script, along with Norm Li's cinematography, focuses on the presence of violence as a pervasive aspect of female experience."
m/the_bodyguard_1992, I was completely unprepared for just how bad The Bodyguard is.
m/the_bodyguard_2011," Bodyguard sparks only when Salman [Khan] is slamming 'em off the walls, with his trademark smile and snarl."
m/the_book_of_eli," Iconically effective as a single-minded messenger with a mission, Washington's Eli is ultimately too confined by the man-of-few-words movie norms he's saddled with."
m/the_book_of_henry, Hollywood needs more films like this one. Films that aren't afraid to take chances and challenge genre as well as audiences.
m/the_book_of_life_2014," A bursting-at-the-seams piata of an animated movie, stuffed with so many glorious visuals, delightful gags and candy-wrapped life and death lessons that it implodes before anyone can savor how sweet a treat it is."
m/the_book_of_love," Fo a film thats trying very hard to make you feel, it sure leaves you cold."
m/the_book_thief," ... The Book Thief doesn't strive to be a necessarily authentic reflection of conditions of the era, and leans on feeling rather the verisimilitude..."
m/the_bookshop, The intimacy is contagious. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/the_borderlands," Much of this may sound familiar, but The Borderlands' crafty virtue is that it understands that hand-held camerawork and boo scares aren't an excuse to neglect plot, dialogue or characters."
m/the_boss_2016," The Boss is a strange tonal mess that's not exactly Tammy bad. But even with McCarthy swinging for the fences, it still can't close the deal."
m/the_boss_baby," ""The Boss Baby"" still feels standard issue and a wee bit tiresome."
m/the_bourne_legacy," Gilroy is an intelligent writer but he is not a technically skillful action director, and so he tries to compensate with a detailed but not very involving tale and characters that like to talk in one too many indoor scenes."
m/the_boxer," Thanks largely to the richly insinuative acting of Day-Lewis and Watson, we're profoundly moved by the power of Maggie and Danny's intentions and desires, if not their actions."
m/the_boxtrolls," It's unlikely to become a cultural juggernaut on the level of something like Frozen, but I think it is as enjoyable."
m/the_boy," Despite game efforts by the cast, this tepid horror opus is never scary enough to overcome its silly premise."
m/the_boy_2015, The director tries to generate a pace that his dramatic efforts fail to match.
m/the_boy_and_the_beast," Rousing, exciting, and incredibly touching: Family-friendly anime really doesn't get much better than this."
m/the_boy_next_door_2015, Yet another January flop that isn't so much released as written-off by Universal.
m/the_boy_who_harnessed_the_wind, The film rarely offers any surprise in the way such extraordinary events are being explained.
m/the_boy_with_the_cuckoo_clock_heart," Eccentric with some striking design touches, but humorless and heartless"
m/the_boys_and_girl_from_county_clare_2004," Agreeably soapy, but if you're not a Ceili fan, you're likely to doze off by the end of the first reel."
m/the_brady_bunch_movie," The film establishes a bland, reassuring, comforting Brady reality - a certain muted tone that works just fine but needs, I think, a bleaker contrast from outside to fully exploit the humor."
m/the_brainwashing_of_my_dad, [VIDEO ESSAY] Jen Senko's workmanlike (Kickstarter-funded) documentary examines American media's propaganda-led phenomenon of extreme rightwing bigotry with a fine-tooth comb.
m/the_brand_new_testament," Van Dormael's film is touching, wise, very funny at times, and winningly surreal."
m/the_brass_teapot," There's not much depth to Mosley's debut, which is based on a short story by Tim Macy. But Michael Angarano and Juno Temple are an appealing pair as John and Alice, struggling suburbanites."
m/the_breadwinner," In its power and its beauty, ""The Breadwinner' reminds us that animation can be every bit as much of a medium for adults as it is for children."
m/the_breaker_upperers, A hilarious and heartfelt ode to female friendship.
m/the_bridge_1959," Wicki brings a tremendous sense of confidence to the project, letting the details of life on the home front heighten the tragedy to come."
m/the_brink_2019," Though it would surely be unwise for journalists to stop paying attention to his comings and goings, it's hard to see what ordinary viewers at any point on the political spectrum will gain from this particular status report."
m/the_broken_circle_breakdown," There's no escaping that the film will jerk tears, but it doesn't deserve the pejorative label that might suggest...Van Groeningen seems to innately understand that sorrow truthfully communicated and shared can be cathartic, rather than depressing."
m/the_bronze," Though no one would accuse ""The Bronze"" of not being funny, it somehow manages not to be funny often enough."
m/the_brooklyn_banker," An overly familiar mob drama, though the authentic Brooklyn settings add color."
m/the_brooklyn_brothers_beat_the_best_2011," It's sweet in places, but too similar to every other eccentric film about a going-nowhere artist hiding his inner brilliance under passive-aggressive annoyingness."
m/the_brother_from_another_planet, An excellent example of what can be achieved with a very small budget and a good screenplay.
m/the_brothers_grimsby, Sacha Baron Cohen brings his B-game - or maybe even his C-game - to this moderate new comedy that basically defeated my attempts to like it.
m/the_bubble_2007," By exploring both sides of the Semitic playing field, Bubble is the antidote to unrewarding diatribes like Paradise Now -- although its final verdict is equally pessimistic."
m/the_burbs," The 'Burbs doesnit quite go the distance, but for most of its length it is a superbly inventive, insightful and funny black comedy."
m/the_butcher_the_chef_and_the_swordsman_2010," Wuershan's heavy hand, never letting up for a moment to allow any air or life to enter the film, cuts off the film's energy even as it rattles relentlessly on."
m/the_bye_bye_man," The derivative work doesn't deliver scares so much as a few starts, all while ripping off such genre classics as ""Candyman"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."""
m/the_cabin_in_the_woods," Detention, which will come out this year.. goes to the next level on meta movies. But Cabin isn't trying to be meta; it's focused on genre. Those are different types of satire so I can appreciate Cabin taking genre further than ever."
m/the_cabinet_of_dr_caligari," A simple, subversive film made all the more interesting because of its style."
m/the_cage_fighter," The Cage Fighter isn't sentimental about the notion of an aging sports hero who needs one more day in the proverbial sun, recognizing that desire as macho folly."
m/the_call_2013," For the most part ... a tense, extreme-jeopardy thriller that delivers the intended goods."
m/the_calling_2014," It's remarkable what a little care and attention can do for a familiar genre, and Jason Stone's The Calling has been made with more than a little of both."
m/the_camden_28_2007," In revisiting the oppressive measures employed by the FBI during that era, the viewer is treated to a welcome message about the right, if not the duty, to challenge authority, especially in the face of corruption, intransigence and utter arrogance."
m/the_campaign, [VIDEO ESSAY] Here's a new twist. Picture a Republican politician with humanitarian ethics.
m/the_canal, What makes The Canal so captivating is less the familiar story than David's intensifying nightmarish mindscape ...
m/the_candy_witch," The Candy Witch tries to tell an interesting story, but ultimately can't overcome the holes in the plot."
m/the_cannibal_club," A diverting, stylish, but ultimately rather trite satire whose social critique and grand guignol aspects never quite come to a full boil."
m/the_canyons_2013," While not about pornography, The Canyons can't help but possess that same lurid whiff of XXX material, from the crotchy, skeevy sweatiness, right down to its poor acting, tossed-off dialogue and visibly low production values..."
m/the_captain_2017, A stunning look at how the right overcoat can turn a schlemiel into a respected leader.
m/the_captain_2019, Passengers on a flight to Tibet survive accidents and weather in a disaster pic that's become a blockbuster hit in China.
m/the_captive_2014, The director renders an already bogus story more preposterous by lathering it in portentous solemnity ...
m/the_car," The action centres on a remote Midwestern town where a demonic driverless car terrorizes motorists, pedestrians and, in one of the film's genuinely scary moments, cyclists."
m/the_cartel," Veteran TV anchor Bob Bowdon's feature debut has all the intricate nuance of an evening newscast; its analysis is heavy on diagnosis but simplistic when it comes to the cure, as well as woefully ignorant of racial and fiscal complications."
m/the_case_for_christ_2017," There are no out-and-out villains in this film; just plenty of people with flaws. And it's with sympathy for all of them, perhaps, that Jon Gunn makes his best case for Christianity"
m/the_castle," An efficient, crowd pleasing, and heartwarming entertainment."
m/the_cat_from_outer_space," The Cat From Outer Space is likely to keep the under-14's amused, at least if supplemented by plenty of popcorn."
m/the_cat_o_nine_tails," Moderately effective, stylish early giallo from Argento"
m/the_cat_returns," With the frantic, infernal energy (and cats) and even a little of the barbed social satire of Mikhail Bulgakov's Master and Margarita."
m/the_catcher_was_a_spy," The biggest adrenaline pump comes when Berg, stir-crazy after working at a desk during World War II, runs at full speed down a hallway. There's a shootout later on that gets less attention than that one short sprint."
m/the_catechism_cataclysm," Watching the lazy surreal odyssey unfold, you might be tempted to see The Catechism Cataclysm as a metaphor about telling a story, or about the futility of telling a story."
m/the_catered_affair_1956, Plays like Marty but without the same winsome appeal.
m/the_celestine_prophecy," The movie is self-conscious and lacks dramatic tension, and the dialogue sounds like people reading passages from James Redfield's novel ..."
m/the_cell_2000," The major problem is that The Cell continuously echoes The Silence of the Lambs, only - the intricate character interplay, Jonathan Demme's direction and the taut storyline."
m/the_challenge_1982, Nifty little culture-clash action flick from John Frankenheimer
m/the_challenge_2017, ... provides an immersive and fascinating look at a subculture of modern excesses clashing with cultural and spiritual traditions.
m/the_chamber_2018," Standard issue trapped-undersea thriller, more melodramatic than most."
m/the_change_up, The Change-Up bravely attempts to revive the dormant subgenre but it's a lame effort that grows increasingly frantic and foul-mouthed as the realization sets in that the gimmick isn't working.
m/the_changeover, ... The Changeover offers the rare sight of a fantasy that feels both distinctly Kiwi and contemporary and that's something to be celebrated and cherished.
m/the_chaperone," It's a blatant exploitation film (what Variety calls ""an actioner""), yet its obviousness, keyed to Levesque's squared-circle appeal, is humorous."
m/the_chaser_2008, Watching the Korean film The Chaser is like chewing diamonds - you know there's something of value in there but mostly it's just a mess of pain and blood.
m/the_chateau, At its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers.
m/the_cherry_orchard_2000, This story tutors us in the practices of kindness and compassion for those caught up in the trauma of change and loss.
m/the_chess_players, Its mannered goofiness echoes the pastoral comedy of Days and Nights In the Forest while the Raj-era dancing-girl trappings recall the decidedly grim The Music Room.
m/the_child_remains, Creepy setting... promising premise... slow-and-obvious horror mystery.
m/the_childhood_of_a_leader," With his unusually accomplished directorial debut, Corbet delivers a strange and startling film that reflects the unique trajectory of his career, as well as the influence of the iconoclastic directors with whom he's already worked."
m/the_children_act," This very faithful adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel - he wrote the screenplay - isn't a barnburner but, anchored by Emma Thompson's excellent performance, definitely keeps your interest."
m/the_china_hustle," Rothstein's irreverent, can-you-believe-this sense of humor makes the anti-capitalist message go down even easier."
m/the_choice," Some will eagerly dig in, while others are likely to find it too sticky and overly rich."
m/the_christmas_candle_2013, The Christmas Candle is both a nice holiday tale and a touching mediation on the value of using one's faith to create everyday miracles.
m/the_christmas_chronicles, Snake Plissken as ol' St. Nick? It works far better than you imagine.
m/the_chronicle_of_anna_magdalena_bach," The Chronicle Of Anna Magdalena Bach disregards most conventions of costume drama to ask some very human questions about history, what it takes to be an artist, and what movies can tell us about ourselves."
m/the_church," Sovai doesn't settle for the easy, opting instead for a more oblique and suggestive, rather than graphic, approach to the material"
m/the_circle_2017, A superficial smartness to the early scenes soon gives way to very obvious plot manipulations.
m/the_clapper," The Clapper hints at the psychological roots of Eddie's peculiar personality, but in the end it isn't at all interested in understanding the man. And that's because it's too busy making fun of him."
m/the_class, Cantet's film makes you squirm with indignation and disbelief. But it also captures one or two of those rare moments of breakthrough that make all the difference to a teacher's will to live.
m/the_cleanse," The film could have easily fallen flat, straying into B movie or comedy territory, but it's a masterful blend of horror, drama and comedy."
m/the_climbers_2019," Impressive sound design, which makes every carabiner clink and boulder impact seem monumental, and Lee's skilled use of close-up photography (combined with fast-cut montage editing) make The Climbers worth seeing on a big screen."
m/the_closer_you_get, A harmlessly amusing comedy about the pursuit of love in a tiny Irish community.
m/the_clovehitch_killer, An excellent McDermott embodies Don with just enough strangeness to keep audiences from knowing precisely where The Clovehitch Killer is heading.
m/the_cobbler_2015, Audiences tickled and delighted by the initial premise are only likely to feel disappointed by the way it pans out.
m/the_cold_lands_2013, This sensitive drama about outsiders never gets too deep inside its characters.
m/the_cold_light_of_day," The one thing that's consistently fun to watch here is Weaver, whose prominent if surely rent-inspired role as a ruthless Terminator in pantsuits generates plenty of accidentally funny stuff."
m/the_coldest_game," Pullman's characterization of a hopeless boozer is so far over the top, it makes Charles Bukowski look like Ned Flanders."
m/the_collection_2012," The rare horror sequel that doesn't demand loyalty to its predecessor, The Collection actively avoids genre clichés for an effectively creepy post-torture thriller."
m/the_collector_1965, Wyler's skill with performances makes the film constantly riveting.
m/the_collini_case, A taut and engrossing legal procedural that has more on its mind than simply reaching a verdict on one man's guilt or innocence.
m/the_colony_2013," On the whole, The Colony might have fared better if it had hunkered down and tried to wait out the global winter."
m/the_color_of_pomegranates, It's best appreciated as an arcane work about a great tortured artist by a great tortured artist.
m/the_color_of_time," ""The Color of Time"" is an odd bird in that its 12 cooks don't necessarily spoil the broth. The problem is that they leave it as broth."
m/the_color_wheel, Some will call The Color Wheel daring. Others will remember that it takes more than desperate shocks to add substance to the sloppy diddlings of a dilettante.
m/the_comedian_2017," It is totally worth it to see De Niro do standup comedy. The plot providing the vehicle for the stand-up comedy is thin, but there's enough stand-up comedy that I'm glad The Comedian exists."
m/the_comedy, Tim Heidecker's Swanson does not amuse us in spite of the pity he inspires but because of it.
m/the_command, The right of Vinterberg to relate this story is debatable but the narrative seems so specifically critical of Russia that one wonders if it could even be made there in the age of Putin.
m/the_commune_2017," Togetherness doesn't work so simply: touching, as well as funny, to be shown how clever people once hoped otherwise."
m/the_commuter, Liam Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra again team up for another stylish and pulpy Hitchcock homage.
m/the_company_you_keep, Robert Redford makes a welcome return to double-duty as director and lead actor in this clear-eyed drama about a former Weather Underground radical forced to reconcile with the past.
m/the_concert_2010," An over-the-top screwball comedy with a thunderous, sentimental conclusion."
m/the_condemned_2013, You may hopefully think you're watching an art-film pastiche along the witty avant-garde lines of something by the Chilean director Ral Ruiz.
m/the_confirmation_2016," In the best moments, Nelson juxtaposes ... ephemeral, eternal doubt against the concrete realities of small-town American poverty and marginality."
m/the_conformist, This film nevertheless touches some issues that seem universal even today.
m/the_congress," There's something exhilarating -- mesmerizing, even -- about The Congress's most ludicrous flourishes."
m/the_conjuring," The Conjuring doesn't try to reinvent the tropes of horror movies, whether it's ghosts or demons or exorcisms, but Fred Astaire didn't invent tap-dancing, either."
m/the_conjuring_2," Lacking some of the simplicity and elegance of the first installment, ""The Conjuring 2"" is nonetheless a smoothly efficient horror movie, building to a powerhouse finale rooted in our emotional connection to the film's well-drawn main characters."
m/the_connection," ""The Connection"" feels at best like a cover version of the classic American crime films of the 1970s, and at worst like so much glossily mounted karaoke."
m/the_conquest_2011," Pic takes genre helmer Xavier Durringer back to his theater roots, with most of the narrative mayhem and laughs coming from pic's sharp dialogue and strong work by seasoned thesps, who just manage to avoid caricature."
m/the_conspiracy_2013, Why do so many contemporary filmmakers use the well-worn device of found footage and documentary shooting style to make thrillers? Does The Blair Witch Project have a mysterious power over all of them?
m/the_conspirator," This is by no means a great movie, but in telling a gripping and little-known true story with many contemporary resonances it has time(liness) on its side."
m/the_corrupted_2020," Scalpello and screenwriter Nick Moorcroft take the lowest common denominator route, falling back on tired mob-movie clichés, stock characters and leaden dialogue so generic it could have been written by an algorithm."
m/the_cotton_club_encore," All right, it's what the world should have seen. Does that make it, 35 years later, worth seeing? No and yes."
m/the_counselor_2013," It's all style, no substance, and a prime example of how a bad script can shackle a first-rate cast."
m/the_counterfeiters_2007," [Director] Ruzowitzky's straightforward approach to this unusual story and cinematographer Benedict Neunfels's documentary-style immediacy transcend the now well-worn Holocaust genre, bringing another side of the tragedy into unflinching focus."
m/the_courier_2019, [The Courier is] a leaden action film that lacks both imagination and logic.
m/the_courtship_of_eddies_father," One of Minnellli's weakest (or is it modest?) serio comedies, dealing with the adjustment problems of a recent widower (Glenn Ford) and his young son (played by child actor-future director Ron Howard)."
m/the_crash_2017," The film may be too preposterous to take seriously, but at least writer-director Aram Rappaport trains his sights on the right enemies."
m/the_crash_reel_2013," Assembled from a plethora of visual sources, including the title footage, this impressively edited and dynamically scored film successfully combines visceral bursts of action with intimately observed sequences ..."
m/the_creeping_garden," All in all, ""The Creeping Garden"" cultivates more style than substance."
m/the_crocodile_hunter_collision_course_2002, One of the most unbearable movies in recent history.
m/the_crow_wicked_prayer, The Crow: Wicked Prayer is just like the first one -- if the first one had been made by a room full of mean-spirited six-year-olds with a finger-paint budget of $12.00.
m/the_crowd_roars_1932, Crosses the finish line as nothing more than routine.
m/the_crucifixion_2017, The Crucifixion is an original film that constructs suspense bit by bit without exaggerating for the sake of jump scares. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/the_cup, Talk about product placement: there are times when The Cup resembles a feature-length advertisement for the race itself.
m/the_cup_1999, La pelcula vuela entre las reflexiones espirituales y las divertidas situaciones de un monje para ver los partidos de soccer en la Copa del Mundo.
m/the_cured, There's a drab air to this low-budget film ... which even Sam Keeley's presence and Tom Vaughan-Lawlor's menace can't totally re-animate.
m/the_current_war_directors_cut," Gorgeous, witty, well-acted and old-fashioned period piece given its sparkling due in a new re-edit."
m/the_curse_of_buckout_road, Just another kids-in-peril horror flick that has flashes of inspiration but isn't distinctive enough to stand out from the pack.
m/the_curse_of_la_llorona_2019, The predatory bogeywoman of Mexican legend haunts 1970s Los Angeles in Michael Chaves' efficiently formulaic shocker.
m/the_curse_of_sleeping_beauty," For viewers who are not into genre trappings, The Curse of Sleeping Beauty [...] is dull and silly beyond belief."
m/the_curse_of_the_gothic_symphony," This gripping film takes us inside the belly of the creative beast - several bellies in fact, from that of the now dead composer, eccentric Englishman with the back to front name, Havergal Brian, through the entire cast of musicians and filmmakers"
m/the_dalai_lama_scientist, The archival footage is fascinating enough to forgive the film's muddled narrative and subpar production values.
m/the_damned_2014," It's all well acted and expertly crafted - quick edits that play mind and visual games with the viewer, music that heightens tension, some cool special effects - but most of the victims are people you want to slap even before their secrets are spilled."
m/the_damned_dont_you_wish_that_we_were_dead," The U.K.'s oldest extant punk band gets a suitably entertaining, fractious documentary tribute."
m/the_danish_girl_2015," ""The Danish Girl"" is so primly told, it treads so delicately around even the most conservative sensibilities that it might just work to change some minds, which makes it valuable in a way an edgier, swifter, more urgent, or exciting film might not be."
m/the_dare," The practical effects are amazing and cringeworthy and if torture porn is your bag, you can fill it up with The Dare."
m/the_dark_2018," Faults aside, The Dark is still effective and emotionally charged. With enough kills to satisfy the bloodthirsty, it will certainly have an audience who love films about the undead but are craving something with a different taste."
m/the_dark_horse_2016, The scale and significance of Potini's efforts become all the more remarkable when viewed through the filter of Curtis' committed performance.
m/the_dark_knight," The film is quite special but where some films can weather extraneous or padded scenes, The Dark Knight has some distracting bloat to it which keeps it out of masterpiece territory."
m/the_dark_knight_rises," Smartly-written, riveting and profoundly human with Oscar-caliber performances. It's the most emotionally and intellectually rewarding blockbuster in years, and thus far the best American film of 2012."
m/the_dark_red," The Dark Red is an interesting way of exploring the hysterical mother trope. Helped massively by a great lead performance, The Dark Red may just have birthed the next screen Sarah Connor."
m/the_dark_tapes, The Dark Tapes ends up doing more right than it does wrong ... you'll find some really cool creatures and a few truly frightening and original moments that will send more than just a chill down the old spine.
m/the_dark_tower_2017," Fans have been clamoring for one since the 1990s, and versions of it have been in and out of development for a decade. Pity them, for the final product is cheap, shoddy, and bland to a confounding degree."
m/the_darkest_hour," Not a good alien invasion movie, but an alien invasion movie; regardless of subpar filmmaking, there's something inherent that leaves you with the need to at least see the story through."
m/the_darkest_minds," Nothing really changes by the end, because after all there are five more of these waiting to be made if this one somehow manages to strike box office gold. I wouldn't hold my breath."
m/the_darkness," It is entirely about being vaguely creepy and so busy pushing its ""evil forces at work"" plot that it can't get bogged down in specifics or worry about pesky things like logic."
m/the_day_he_arrives_2011, Modern Korean drama recalls heady games of Godard and Resnais
m/the_day_shall_come, 'The Day Shall Come' is a farce to be reckoned with
m/the_dead," The Dead celebrates the beauty of the English language, the challenges of marital love and the intimations of mortality which can bring us back to an exaltation of life."
m/the_dead_2011, The Ford brothers' zombie apocalypse is the better for being told so straight - although its adherence to Romero's shuffling conventions does not extend to the film offering any coherent contemporary social commentary.
m/the_dead_center, The film is in tune with the need to remain lucid and empathetic while in the maw of human extremity.
m/the_dead_dont_die_2019," Caleb Landry Jones, as the resident awkward-nerd fanboy, also gets some stuff to play-but otherwise, this richly assembled cast goes to waste."
m/the_dead_lands," Lovely to look at but it feels long at just under 2 hours, and ends with a gory whimper rather than the anticipated spectacularly bloody bang."
m/the_deal_2005, The Deal clearly aims at being a roman-a-clef. Instead it's more of a roman-a-clumsy.
m/the_death_and_life_of_john_f_donovan, [Dolan's] film falls victim to his worst tendencies.
m/the_death_and_life_of_marsha_p_johnson, The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson  is a devastating but stellar documentary that explores the life of the vibrant and vivacious LGBTQ rights icon.
m/the_death_of_dick_long, The Death of Dick Long goes too far by taking the dramatic route instead of playing the revolting cause of Dick's death totally for laughs.
m/the_death_of_mr_lazarescu," The Death of Mr. Lazarescu comes on like a force of nature; radiating a startling intensity, it demands to be reckoned with."
m/the_death_of_stalin," The Death Of Stalin is superbly cast, and acted with icy and ruthless force by an A-list lineup. There are no weak links. Each has a plum role; each squeezes every gorgeous horrible drop."
m/the_death_of_superman," Intense animated adventure filled with brutality, deaths."
m/the_death_of_superman_reign_of_the_supermen_double_feature," Reign of the Supermen is an improvement over its predecessor, but it still lacks emotional punch."
m/the_decent_one, It operates under a discursive premise so presumptuous and flimsy that its attempted function as an experiential documentary proffers little more than a book-on-tape-on-film.
m/the_decline," Of course, an unexpected, unfortunate event occurs. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/the_decline_of_western_civilization_1988," The interviews are mostly very funny, probably not always intentionally so. It's far from unmissable, but it's valuable rock history with some great noise."
m/the_decoy_bride," Cupid works in strange and sometimes very funny ways, as this charming, nontaxing comedy directed by Sheree Folkson makes clear."
m/the_deep_2013," Back on home turf, Contraband director Kormkur has made a suitably dramatic recreation of a remarkable episode."
m/the_deep_blue_sea," The movie is occasionally moving and very well-acted, but despite all the crying manages to feel slight."
m/the_deer_hunter," The actors in the principal roles are so convincing and the movement of this story, told on such a grand scale, is so compelling that its greatness is undeniable."
m/the_delinquent_season," If this film reminds us of anything, it's not to let go lightly."
m/the_demolisher," One doesn't normally think of Toronto as having particularly mean streets, but they certainly look menacing in Gabriel Carrer's hyper-stylized take on the vigilante thriller."
m/the_den, Zach Donohue's debut feature ingeniously uses only computer images to tell its tale.
m/the_departure_2020," Despite some style, too much torrid steam is off-screen and too little rancor coalesces and festers to truly shock."
m/the_descendants_2011, Clooney and the elder daughter (Shailene Woodley) give Oscar-worthy performances in this hard-knocks film that will have you laughing one moment and sobbing the next.
m/the_descent_2, It's hard to argue that this is anything but a scary yet slightly superfluous sequel.
m/the_details_2010," A solid black comedy, with scene stealing performances from Laura Linney, and Ray Liotta."
m/the_devil_and_daniel_webster, Huston and Arnold are superb in this stirring blend of American and Faust.
m/the_devil_bat, With the assistance of his trusty bats Beyyyla sets out to take revenge on his megalomaniac corporate employer. Need I say more?
m/the_devil_inside, The ending for The Devil Inside was so bad and people were jeering so loudly you would have thought Mel Gibson just walked into the synagogue on Saturday.
m/the_devil_wears_prada," Soggy without a story. A job with a world-famous, powerful monster comes with enviable perks. See it only for sexy Simon Baker."
m/the_devils_candy," Kiara Glasco gives one of the best 'scream queen' performances of all-time...A muscular, punchy genre exercise that feels like a new classic simply because the filmmakers noticeably gave a damn."
m/the_devils_doorway," [S]pooky as hell, with some biting commentary on the history of the Catholic Church and a setting that grows increasingly claustrophobic and menacing as the narrative deepens."
m/the_devils_double," This is a movie too enamored of its own tawdriness, turning every violent act and violation into gratuitously salacious grindhouse set pieces."
m/the_devils_miner," A study in courage and harrowing portrait of a 14-year-old boy who works in a Bolivian silver mine, The Devil's Miner is an unforgettable journey through hell under the earth, where Satan is worshipped as king."
m/the_devils_playground, Everyone makes a terrific contribution as Schepisi peels away the surface to reveal a morass of personal demons
m/the_devils_rock," This is far from original, but the claustrophobic setting and bloody prosthetic carnage should entertain undemanding horror fans."
m/the_diabolical_2015," a rich and intriguing variation on a timeworn theme, as the tropes of the haunted house flick are ingeniously reverse-engineered and rebuilt into something else."
m/the_diary_of_a_teenage_girl, A fine adaptation of Phoebe Gloeckner's autobiographical novel about a sexually precocious 1970s adolescence.
m/the_dictator_2012," Not as offbeat and edgy as Borat and not as vulgar as Bruno, this is Baron Cohen's most mainstream film, containing political barbs, visual gags, and bathroom jokes that are often extremely funny."
m/the_dilemma," Director Ron Howard and the gifted actors are defeated by a misguided film, which suffers from identity crisis, disappointing as a male buddy comedy and/or more serious account of the nature and limitations of friendhsip."
m/the_dinner_2017," A shouty, hammy, tedious, damp-squib firework display of dullness."
m/the_dinner_party_2020," Both unpalatable and indigestible...[a] dreary hodgepodge of horror-movie clichés, played at a ponderous pace that accentuates the overripe dialogue and ludicrously theatrical performances."
m/the_dinosaur_project, The found-footage horror genre branches out into family-friendly territory with this modestly budgeted action-adventure thriller [in which the victims] are so sketchily characterised that you barely register their presence before they meet their demise.
m/the_dirt_2019," The danger of a document like The Dirt is in showing pigheadedness as not only fun and cool, but also elemental, inexplicable, and unstoppable. Boys will be boys, boys, boys."
m/the_disappearance_of_eleanor_rigby_them," As one movie, it may not be a groundbreaking look at relationships, but what remains is an unusually delicate American drama."
m/the_disappointments_room, There simply aren't enough scares to build tension throughout. Most of the film is just Beckinsale walking around looking worried.
m/the_disaster_artist," It's a hilarious master class in self-referentiality, as well as an affectionate and reverential tribute to Tommy Wiseau and his mad creation."
m/the_discovery_2017, Jason Segel and Rooney Mara are an unlikely central pairing in this low-key sci-fi about the discovery of an afterlife.
m/the_dish_and_the_spoon_2011," With its deliberately quirky characters and meandering series of events, this mumblecore movie is enjoyably ramshackle, constantly catching us off guard with spiky humour or warm emotion."
m/the_divergent_series_allegiant," Woodley ... struggles with a character that, unlike Jennifer Lawrence in the Hunger Games films, is getting less interesting with each passing movie."
m/the_divide_2012, Gens' disaster pic has visual flair aplenty and an explosive third reel which mostly forgives the inoffensively routine first two.
m/the_divine_fury," While it has some good elements and can be fun from time to time, the unoriginal plot and concept, flat storyline and uninteresting characters do not really heighten expectations for the upcoming films."
m/the_divine_order, Feminism triumphs as Swiss women push for the right to vote.
m/the_diving_bell_and_the_butterfly_2007," An arresting true story and a ravishing visual creation, but the two remain separate entities that do not support one another but get in each other's way instead."
m/the_do_deca_pentathlon, The film overall feels like a series of cheesy home-video outtakes.
m/the_dog_2014, What makes The Dog so compelling isn't Wojtowicz's cinematic imprint but the place in history that was very likely denied him by chance and his own irascibility.
m/the_dog_lover," At best, The Dog Lover is like a bad Hallmark Channel or Lifetime movie, so bland and vanilla it would be inhumane to canines to call it a ""dog"" of a movie."
m/the_dogs_of_war," Cry Havoc . . . and wake me up for the last 15 minutes. Not a bad film, but it is a bit of a mixed bag. I just wish that bag had held a higher body count."
m/the_doorman_2008," Not until the goofy closing credits does the film hit its tonal stride and nail what could have been its saving, salient theme: the absurd lines that fancy people draw (and obey) to make themselves feel special on a Saturday night."
m/the_double_2011," Too silly to be confusing and too flaccid to reach potboiler status, the convoluted spy-thriller The Double is a tossed-off theatrical release that lands with a resounding thud."
m/the_double_2013," Arch, weird and very, very funny, it's like watching an entire Bulgarian film festival in a single sitting."
m/the_dresser," It is, it really is, just as magnificent, powerful and enthralling as you would imagine. Yet to assume the greatness of The Dresser based on the simply sum of its parts is to miss the whole point of the story."
m/the_dressmaker," Moorhouse's adaptation of Rosalie Ham's 2000 novel may lead audiences to expect a primmer, more well-behaved movie based on its title alone, but that doesn't mean it won't have them in stitches."
m/the_driller_killer, I suspect that a viewer might also begin wielding a power drill if he or she had to sit through it too many times.
m/the_drop," With its optimistic ending, the film muddies its previous statements regarding the danger of unthinkingly hanging on to totems of the past."
m/the_drowning, Distinguishes itself by applying a depth of psychological observation that yields a genuinely unsettling vision.
m/the_duel_2016, Hemsworth's emotionless performance (and a murky subplot about his wife's inexplicable descent into madness) mean that this scattershot Western misses its mark.
m/the_duelist_2016, Eye for detail makes The Duelist's protagonists just as compelling as their setting.
m/the_duff," This winsome comedy is a little low in the stakes department, not to mention predictable, but it gets an ""A"" for charm."
m/the_duke_is_tops, Mildly entertaining all-black musical that introduced a 21-year-old Lena Horne.
m/the_duke_of_burgundy," A midnight movie for the smart set, the latest from up-and-coming filmmaker Peter Strickland is a beautiful puzzle."
m/the_dyatlov_pass_incident," As a solution to a genuine Soviet-era mystery, it leaves Occam's razor out in the cold - but as a clever, confounding trip through some of the more unusual events of the last hundred years, it gets more than just a pass"
m/the_eagle_huntress, Aisholpan's sincerity and joy shines through [any] concerns. She's a genuine hero for the 21s century and her story is not to be missed.
m/the_earrings_of_madame_de," Ophuls's camera style is famous for its physicalization of time, in which every fleeting moment is recorded and made palpable by the ceaseless tracking shots, yet his delineation of space is also sublime and highly charged."
m/the_east_2013, There's no doubt that talented filmmakers like Batmanglij and Marling have a bright future in Hollywood.
m/the_edge_of_democracy, A deeply felt rumination on a troubled political scene.
m/the_edge_of_seventeen," Fast, full-hearted and graced with a beautifully modulated lead turn by Hailee Steinfeld, the movie takes the risk of playing it straight and sincere - and the risk pays off."
m/the_editor, A well worked and occasionally well-sustained satire of the wonderfully sleazy Italian murder-mystery melodramas from the 1960s to the '80s ...
m/the_edukators, The dramatic edge this film develops comes from the rather wonderfully conveyed discovery of mutual attraction.
m/the_efficiency_expert," It's interesting, the way Hopkins' face relaxes as the movie continues and his character learns, perhaps for the first time, that time and motion studies are about people, not facts."
m/the_eiger_sanction," One of Clint's lesser-known adventures, and one that's certainly worth of a revisit."
m/the_elephant_in_the_living_room_2010," The Elephant in the Living Room is structurally scattershot but its evidence is sound and fair, its characters sympathetic and its message, if muddled, is still important and effectively delivered."
m/the_elephant_queen," The Elephant Queen is messy, but it's still a worthwhile nature watch that educates viewers on how important elephants are to the biomes across which they traverse and why."
m/the_emoji_movie, Excuse me while I scan my phone for the vomit emoji.
m/the_emperor_and_the_assassin, Chen mixes in rich details and politics to make it all come alive and seem relevant.
m/the_empty_hours, Aarón Fernández captures one of the most heartening elements of sex: that it doesn't always oblige our rules or expectations.
m/the_end, Not nearly as bad as its reputation. It's even pretty interesting.
m/the_end_of_love, Too often toddles over the fine line between cute and cloying before finding its footing in the final reel.
m/the_end_of_the_tour_2015," Intimate, soul-baring, and winning, ""The End Of The Tour"" is a special, lovely little gem worth cherishing."
m/the_end_of_time, Funny how a film that explodes our conventional notions about time should be so up-to-date with the news.
m/the_endless," Hiccups aside, though, The Endless rapidly develops from a mysterious, elliptical story about cult survivors and strained relationships into a much larger and stranger movie, essentially the Aliens to Resolution's original Alien."
m/the_english_surgeon," Exceptionally well-crafted, this doc may appeal most to those who have a doctor in the family. But I can't imagine anyone seeing it dispassionately."
m/the_english_teacher," Notwithstanding some very bizarre stylistic choices and sometimes erratic character transformations, The English Teacher is a frothy indie dramedy with dedicated performances and plenty of pep."
m/the_equalizer_2013," The Equalizer's blue collar melodrama is rich with potential, but squandered on self-seriousness and slow-motion action techniques past their prime."
m/the_escape_2018, Gemma Arterton's strong but shattered performance as a disconnected housewife bolsters Dominic Savage's thoughtful marital drama.
m/the_escape_artist, The Escape Artist is a riveting film about a son trying to prove himself to his father.
m/the_escape_of_prisoner_614," Like ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil,"" without the evil, without charismatic stars, without a laugh in it."
m/the_europeans, The Europeans is an engaging study of manners and morals.
m/the_evil_dead_2013," With simpler aims and oodles of blood, the new movie is a watered down scare-fest that works in spite of its formula by constantly frightening audiences into submission."
m/the_evil_within_2017, One of most singularly strange films to come along in a good while.
m/the_exception, Intrigue swirls around the exiled Kaiser Wilhelm before a meeting with Nazi leaders in a capable World War II romance with memorable acting.
m/the_expedition_to_the_end_of_the_world_2014," If marveling at the world - and its collapse - sounds appealing to you, hustle up a ticket."
m/the_expendables," A bunch of guys past their prime punching and kicking each other and pretending its for our benefit, when its really just one last self-congratulatory hurrah."
m/the_expendables_2," The Expendables 2 is causing me to rethink all I know, or think I know. Because on so many levels, it is inexcusably bad, and yet... I liked it."
m/the_expendables_3," They are enjoyable moments in a film that entertains for much of its run-time, and it's still a blast watching these '80s icons get together to blow stuff up onscreen."
m/the_exterminating_angel," I watched it and I don't know what it means either, but it's a hell of a movie."
m/the_eye_of_the_storm, I'm not sure that the depths of the novel have been plumbed in the film... But it is time that an attempt was made on Patrick White and the array of talent in and around this film makes this a grand effort
m/the_eyes_of_my_mother_2016," ""The Eyes of My Mother"" is a must-see. It's intense as hell, and a supreme example of how the morally repugnant can be made to look weirdly beautiful."
m/the_face_of_an_angel," The central performances are impressive, with Kate Beckinsale especially good ..."
m/the_face_of_love, Annette Bening and Ed Harris bring potent conviction to this maudlin but strangely compelling psychological love story.
m/the_fall_of_the_house_of_usher_1960," Quite possibly the finest combination of Corman, Price and Poe."
m/the_falling_2014, Female anxieties and emotions spill over in a potent brew which effectively explores both sexual awakening and fear of the opposite sex.
m/the_family_2013," De Niro is a hoot to watch, and the action scenes are a ton of fun. Unfortunately, the movie just couldn't find the right tone to be wholly successful."
m/the_family_fang, The Family Fang manages to mine well-earned laughs and genuine feeling from a unique and absurd family portrait.
m/the_family_tree, It has a terrific cast of actors doing committed work; it also has a screenplay that tries so hard to be quirky that it tires itself out.
m/the_fanatic_2019," A brainless, exploitative folly which gives John Travolta free rein to mine the history of cringe-worthy autism portrayals for an offensively garish Frankenstein pantomime of unhinged obsession."
m/the_fare, THE FARE is a beautifully crafted mystery that explores the desire for connection and intimacy within the confines of a moving taxing cab.
m/the_farewell_2019," In Lulu Wang's lovely, melancholy The Farewell, Awkwafina breaks out in a much bigger way with her first major role, creating a wholly realistic character, and revealing a talent for dramatic acting that you may not have realized she possessed."
m/the_farewell_party, The Farewell Party makes drama out of right-to-die politics and asserts that just about everyone who makes it past a certain age will have to contend with the issue in one way or another.
m/the_farm_life_inside_angola_prison_1998, This riveting documentary will fuel your moral rage against institutionalized injustice.
m/the_fate_of_the_furious, The Fate of the Furious provides plenty of the high-octane escapism and ridiculously elaborate vehicular mayhem fans of the series expect.
m/the_fault_in_our_stars," While The Fault in Our Stars can be overbearingly schlocky at times, it is also an emotionally heartfelt film, especially in regards to the central romance that is sure to make the target audience swoon."
m/the_favourite_2018," All three members of the main trio are at their best, but it's Colman who most deserves a coronation."
m/the_fearless_vampire_killers," Macabre, jet-black comedy with Polanski's unique sensibility in evidence in abundance."
m/the_female_brain," Though the laughs are hit-and-miss, the synapses are always firing."
m/the_field_guide_to_evil," This is 'folk horror' par excellence, hopping the globe in search of the collective origins of our errant unconscious."
m/the_fields," This low-budget thriller looks more expensive than it is with its imaginative use of set, like the spooky amusement park and, outstandingly, the titular cornfields."
m/the_fifth_estate," ...The Fifth Estate focuses on what is ultimately a petty personal feud, while mostly missing the revolution that's still happening keystroke by keystroke on computer screens around the world."
m/the_fifth_wave," The whole thing becomes so ludicrous that it's unintentionally funny as it reaches its lackluster climax, which is carefully designed to lead into the next film, assuming there is one."
m/the_fight_2020, The Fight does the work of uncovering the human faces and the immense emotional and intellectual labor that make up the organization.
m/the_fighter_2011," Russell choreographs and shoots scenes of interpersonal squabbling and in-ring fisticuffs with competent but unremarkable efficiency, leaving the proceedings devoid of distinctive authorial personality."
m/the_final_girls, The Final Girls is the kind of film that could only be made by a true scholar of the form. It's just as funny as it is thoughtful.
m/the_final_master," The real selling point is the fighting, and if you're a fan of fighting with knives, The Final Master has got you covered."
m/the_final_member," This project isn't intended to mock or titillate anybody, but to depict with sincerity and good humor the story of one man's quest."
m/the_final_wish," It's nothing fancy, but it does the premise far better than most of its predecessors."
m/the_final_year," Under the current circumstances, Barker has given us a film with much broader appeal, one that's not only absorbing but also essential in its depiction of humane, responsible leadership."
m/the_finest_hours," Gillespie isn't able to conjure a stirring cinematic experience. The pieces don't fuse so much as fit together, and much of the action feels instructive rather than immersive."
m/the_first_beautiful_thing," Italians need not worry - when it comes to issues with their parents, the Greeks still hold the title for being the most messed up. I mean, did you hear about what happened to that Oedipus kid?"
m/the_first_grader," A lot of history gets horned into this undeniably inspirational parable, though slick execution and simplistic storytelling make it a lesson suitable only for easily impressed elementary-school students."
m/the_first_monday_in_may, Andrew Rossi pays sporadic lip service to recognizing cultural specificity before returning to his star-gazing ways.
m/the_first_purge," The pilot for an upcoming 10-part television series, ""The First Purge"" is a violent, often incoherent, action/thriller that lacks the clever elements that made its predecessors work."
m/the_first_time_2012, This comedy about two teens losing their virginity aims for hilarity but instead achieves ho-hum status.
m/the_fits_2016, This singular mix of character study and mysterious mood piece might not have come off quite so successfully if not for Royalty Hightower's internal performance.
m/the_fitzgerald_family_christmas," A terrific holiday movie. Edward Burns' most invigorating, heartfelt picture in years."
m/the_five_year_engagement," Although the movie follows a predictable pattern right through to its happy ending, it's helped by two main characters who feel like real people in love, with real problems."
m/the_flat_2012," In families, this fascinating film suggests, acknowledging or denying the darker truths of one's legacy is a choice that must be made again and again, each and every day."
m/the_flaw_2011, An entertaining and accessible overview of the 2008 meltdown.
m/the_flight_of_the_intruder," It's a strangely disconnected movie that leads up to a point, makes it, and then drones on for another 45 minutes in increasingly witless cliches."
m/the_flintstones," The first time around, The Flintstones' visuals are a light-hearted kick, but there's nothing more to do."
m/the_flood_2019," It's hard not to feel sympathy for those fleeing from war or fears for their lives who seek out a safer life, and The Flood is profoundly moving."
m/the_florida_project," The deceptive intelligence of The Florida Project is how immersive this bouncy-castle reality is while sitting exactly on top of the drawn-out, unremarked tragedy that is life on the margins of respectable, solvent society."
m/the_flower_of_my_secret, It slowly unfolds from a narrow satire into a romance that's rich with real-life bitterness.
m/the_flowers_of_war," An exploration of the nature of heroism and sacrificial love during the Japanese occupation of Nanking in 1937, from acclaimed Chinese director Zhang Yimou."
m/the_fluffer, The third act strives for a debased melancholy and topsy-turvy wisdom only Almodvar could pull off.
m/the_fluffy_movie," At one point, the comic says that fans have asked him what he'll have to talk about if he keeps losing weight, to which Iglesias answers that he will always have stories to tell. To its credit, ""The Fluffy Movie"" leaves you wanting to hear more of them."
m/the_flying_deuces," It's not bad, but it ought to be better with those stars and that director."
m/the_flying_swords_of_dragon_gate," The 3D is terrific in Flying Swords of Dragon Gate, but helmer Tsui Hark's costume actioner -- the first Chinese-lingo movie shown in the stereoscopic Imax format -- is let down by two-dimensional characters."
m/the_fog_1980," The dead men spend a good deal of the movie persecuting a newcomer in town, which raises serious questions about their revenge competence."
m/the_fog_of_war_eleven_lessons_from_the_life_of_robert_s_mcnamara," There aren't any easy answers, and devotees of Errol Morris should know that going in."
m/the_forbidden_dance," A deadly combination of inept political cartooning and fatigued, dirt-poor filmmaking anti-skills."
m/the_forbidden_room_2015," Coherent? Almost. Demented? Pretty much. But once the undead banana monsters show up, resistance is futile."
m/the_foreigner_2017," It is always nice to see [Jackie] Chan doing a serious action film, and this is definitely one of his better ones of late."
m/the_forest_2016," The real Aokigahara Forest might be a spooky and unsettling place, but the fictitious film that takes place inside it is anything but that. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Violence, Scares, etc. - Also Available)"
m/the_forest_for_the_trees_2005, It's impossible not to emphasize with [the main character]...
m/the_forest_of_love, Hinges around an extremely ripe performance by Kippei Shiina as Joe Murata.
m/the_forest_of_the_lost_souls," Clocking in at just 70 minutes, when The Forest of Lost Souls gets it right, it excels..."
m/the_forger_2014, An unpersuasive mixture of clunky family tearjerker and lazy crime caper.
m/the_forgiven_2018," The Forgiven tackles its important political and social issues in an overly talky fashion. The film has its merits, but it represents a significant comedown for the director of such classics as The Mission and The Killing Fields."
m/the_forgiveness_of_blood," [A] compelling film touching on the perils of being young-that's it, merely young-in a culture without justice."
m/the_forgotten_kingdom," Adults might find this overly sentimental... though it's ideal viewing for kids -- informative, visually impressive, and generous in its worldview."
m/the_forgotten_space_2011," At times as much a travelogue as it is an investigative portrait, [it] finds unexpected tributaries where mass transit has altered the life of the common worker, usually with negative results."
m/the_founder," [Hancock has] cast the film with splendid actors who can handle that kind of breezy energy. It's never laugh out loud funny, but we're invited to enjoy Kroc as a rascal, not a villain... almost til the end."
m/the_fountain, Had this been the 'Sixties hippies would have watched it stoned . . .
m/the_four_times, The complexities of ordinary life don't fit into Frammartino's picture-postcard pieties; his sincere but diffuse spirituality is the cinematic equivalent of New Age music.
m/the_fox_and_the_child_2007," This isn't Fantastic Mr Fox, it's just an ordinary vixen who I wished would stay well away from this tiresome child, and let her make some friends with someone of her own age and species."
m/the_fp," Neither obliviously dreadful enough to be ""so bad it's good,'' nor intentionally tongue-in-cheek enough to be funny."
m/the_free_world," Dog metaphors prove to be only one of Jason Lew's problems, as his debut The Free World is riddled with more than a few unfortunate directorial choices."
m/the_freebie," Though its premise seems ripe for a high-concept studio yukfest, The Freebie is all the better for its low-budget, human-scale approach."
m/the_french_minister," Much of ""The French Minister"" is enjoyably brisk, Tavernier moving his camera and actors around the ministry's cramped offices and corridors with speed and grace."
m/the_freshman," Lloyd has never been a very good actor; he has been a dummy for comic devices. And we are not much moved by the scene in The Freshman in which he learns at last that he has been the butt of his fellow students, instead of, as he has believed, their hero."
m/the_frighteners, Every frame drips with Jackson's moviemaking fever.
m/the_frisco_kid," All in all, a surprisingly competent entertainment."
m/the_front_line_2012," If you like war movies, this one is a dandy. Sure, you'll recognize some of the genre's shopworn conventions, but there are enough unique twists and details to make ""The Front Line"" memorable."
m/the_front_runner_2018," Reitman aspires to something of an Altmanesque sweep, putting Hart and his wife, Lee (Vera Farmiga, tremendously good), at the center of a circus."
m/the_frontier, An appreciably moody but dramatically stilted crime drama that exudes a certain retro appeal before collapsing into a series of empty neo-noir poses.
m/the_frontier_2014," There's clearly a troubled history here, but co-writer/director Matt Rabinowitz doesn't artfully withhold information so much as lay it all on the table a bit earlier than he might have."
m/the_frozen_ground," After a dispiriting run of dumbly routine thrillers - Stolen, Trespass, Justice - Nicolas Cage raises his game with this workmanlike police procedural."
m/the_fruit_hunters_2012, The Fruit Hunters engages and educates in a way that is almost as rich as the miraculous bounty which forms its subject.
m/the_fundamentals_of_caring," With material this familiar, casting is crucial. And Burnett has a pair of aces up his sleeve in Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts ..."
m/the_funhouse_1981, It's creepy and effective and a kind of fun horror picture we don't see anymore.
m/the_funhouse_massacre, The minimal story quickly devolves into one methodical murder after another - their effect blunted by the jokey tone.
m/the_furies_2019," The Furies squanders its potential on an overly familiar progression of events, resulting in a half-baked film that could have been so much more, yet is content to retread the same paths as countless films before it."
m/the_future," July breaks narrative structure like an experimental film, but never violates the narrative like a French New Wave film might."
m/the_future_of_food," If audiences allow director Deborah Koons Garcia to have her way, her film will do to agricultural giant Monsanto what Bowling to Columbine did to Lockheed Martin."
m/the_galapagos_affair_satan_came_to_eden," The material and resources are certainly substantial, but the filmmakers clumsily weave separate stories together without detailing anything beyond a tangential relation."
m/the_gallows," A chilling setup gives way to insufferable characters, false scares and a bevy of ear-piercing jolts that shouldn't be confused with terror."
m/the_gallows_act_ii," This is an unappetizing hash of ""It Follows"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" as well as countless post-""Candyman"" fright flicks about curious kids conjuring bad mojo."
m/the_gambler_2015, Our anti-hero has a gambling addiction. He is depressed. He is trapped. And the arc of the movie is about him trying to ditch his unhappy life and pull it out. Snore.
m/the_gameplan, Pure Disney formula stuff (think 'The Pacifier' and 'Three Men And A Baby'). But despite its predictability the movie turns out to be a comic touchdown for The Rock who scores lots of laughs in this winning family entertainment.
m/the_gangs_all_here_1943," ...we're all part of the show when it comes to this 1943 musical comedy, accepting and delighting in its escapist frivolity."
m/the_gangster_the_cop_the_devil," As much fun as it is to watch Lee beat people up and strut around in shiny pinstripe suits, it's just as much of a pleasure to watch him think it all through."
m/the_garden_1990," ""The Garden"" is spellbinding throughout. Shot on Super-8, 16mm, and video, the film is both raw and sensual. Pleasure comes as vivid images wash across the screen and the audience... [A] heady mix of sadness and fury."
m/the_garden_left_behind, 'The Garden Left Behind' is a beautiful and devastating portrait of a trans woman of color.
m/the_garden_of_eden_2008," The resulting sangria cocktail is mild, unchallenging, and kinda dull."
m/the_garden_of_the_finzi_continis," Splendidly recreated, Vittorio De Sica's elegantly painful and eloquently tragic tribute to the demise of the Jewish aristocracy in Italy in WWII deservedly won the best foreign-language Oscar in 1971."
m/the_gardener_2018," Even those with no horticultural ability whatsoever -- okay, I'm talking about myself -- can enjoy The Gardener."
m/the_gatekeeper_2001," While his instincts as a director could use some sharpening, Frey's performance and script, brought to life by a solid supporting cast, are both uncommonly smart."
m/the_gatekeepers_2012, A refreshingly candid and controversial documentary where former heads of Israel's security agency explain their take on the war against terrorism and express their criticism of the nation as a police state.
m/the_gentlemen," ""If you can excuse Ritchie's macho-centric world, with its constant c-word curses and racist slurs, then there is plenty to relish."""
m/the_german_doctor, A credible imagining of a brief period in Mengele's South American exile. The what-if conceit is intriguing enough not to be undone by increasingly heavy-handed symbolism.
m/the_ghost_and_mr_chicken," For youngsters who hadn't experienced anything stronger than the attack of the ping-pong balls on 'Captain Kangaroo,' 'Mr. Chicken' -- with its spooky organ music, blood-dripping portrait and haunted 'murder house' -- was deliciously traumatic..."
m/the_ghost_of_peter_sellers," [I]t's ultimately an emotionally cathartic and absorbing movie about a man who can't let go, yet wants to be free."
m/the_giant_behemoth," Behemoth is, if not a great film, then a solid one, clever and smart in the right places."
m/the_giant_mechanical_man," Kirk's wispy screenplay is light on conflict and memorable moments, but the cast elevates the film to a pleasurable diversion."
m/the_gift_2015," Gender stereotyping aside, The Gift is an otherwise accomplished debut feature with far more ambition than standard genre fare."
m/the_girl_2013, A patient chamber piece about the emotional bruises left by poverty and neglect.
m/the_girl_from_the_naked_eye," At times off-putting, at other times outright campy, ""The Girl From the Naked Eye"" does offer a measured amount of queasy fun."
m/the_girl_in_the_book," ""The Girl in the Book"" proves to be anything but a page-turner."
m/the_girl_in_the_photographs, The Girl in the Photographs marks an amusingly gory sophomore effort from writer-director Nick Simon.
m/the_girl_in_the_spiders_web, There's a slick competency on show. It's watchable enough but let down by a strange lack of interest in presenting Salander as anything but an engine to propel a plot.
m/the_girl_is_in_trouble_2012," Wilmer Valderrama -- yes, HIM -- reinvents himself as a truly scary heavy in this brisk and biting thriller."
m/the_girl_king," Sometimes a big ole mess, sometimes enlightening and rewarding, this quite feminist biopic has a lot wrong with it but is not devoid of real substance."
m/the_girl_on_the_train_2016," When you've been spoiled by the dark, meticulous David Fincher lending his artistry to paperback potboilers with ""Girl"" in the title -- even when they're not his best work -- Taylor's flat commercial instincts make for diminishing returns."
m/the_girl_tv_2012," The Girl, written by Gwyneth Hughes and directed by Julian Jarrold, is remarkable, disturbing and something Hitch would have understood. In addition, it insists quietly on a nagging question: why do we like Vertigo so much?"
m/the_girl_who_kicked_the_hornets_nest," Larsson is renowned for his attention to marginal details, which gives his prose a rambling, one-thing-after-another pace that many readers find soothing. Onscreen, the lack of acceleration makes for one of those long Scandinavian winter nights."
m/the_girl_who_leapt_through_time," It's basically the equivalent of a sensitively wrought read from the Young Adult shelf, and there's naught wrong with that."
m/the_girl_with_all_the_gifts," A smartly compelling, emotionally engaging and stylishly executed film ..."
m/the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo," [VIDEO] David Fincher can do a great re-make. Now, let's hope he never does one again."
m/the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo_2009," It unfolds not with the breakneck velocity of a typical movie of this sort, but with the gradual, unforced, character-based focus of a novel."
m/the_girls_in_the_band," A euphoric, triumphant documentary, in which these unsung female jazz musicians get the last word too. As when one recalls when asked by a reporter, 'what's it like to be a female composer' she replies, 'what's it like to be a male journalist.'"
m/the_giver," ""The Giver"" reaches the screen in a version that captures the essence of Lowry's affecting allegory but little of its mythic pull - a recipe likely to disappoint fans while leaving others to wonder what all the fuss was about."
m/the_glass_bottom_boat_1966," The film flails airlessly, not unlike Day herself when she's mistakenly locked inside Taylor's anti-gravity prototype."
m/the_glass_castle_2017," ""The Glass Castle"" is a family portrait that at its heart is a father-daughter movie, anchored by two outstanding actors."
m/the_glass_shield," Though no masterpiece, the film is an interesting sidebar for moviegoers who try to keep up; it's like a '50s film noir oddity you catch on 3 a.m. TV, only to find that it's become a more scintillating view than Ben-Hur."
m/the_go_getter_2008, The Go-Getter is a nearly perfect demonstration of what happens when what was once a frontier for exploration becomes a factory floor for repetition.
m/the_go_getters," A hilarious dark comedy full of energy and crude humor, The Go-Getters is a delight from beginning to end."
m/the_goebbels_experiment, The assemblage of archival footage reveals itself as a rivetingly experimental evocation of the Nazi rise to power.
m/the_gold_rush," A delight from beginning to end, boasting several of its maker's most memorable gags and Chaplinesque interludes."
m/the_golden_dream, A lukewarm examination of a hot-potato political issue.
m/the_golem_2019," It looks like a particularly handsome illustrated volume of fairy tales--and acts like one, too."
m/the_good_catholic, ... deliberately paced drama that likely won't generate much interest beyond the faithful.
m/the_good_dinosaur," It is weighed down by a flawed concept, unappealing characters and a soundtrack that lacks anything close to a memorable tune."
m/the_good_doctor_2011," The film is anchored and greatly bolstered by Bloom, who delivers a performance of quietly escalating madness."
m/the_good_lie_2013," A heartwarming, culturally significant, though possibly ill-timed drama about survival, community and the strong bonds of family."
m/the_good_neighbor_2016," There's not much real suspense stirred here by a premise that straddles recent found-footage thrillers and ""Rear Window."""
m/the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly," Sergio Leone sure is a great director. He has a unique visual style, combining gorgeous establishing shots of Western landscape and tense close-ups."
m/the_good_the_bad_the_weird," The movie raises the bar yet again for South Korean tech expertise and ambition, as well as launching the K-oater subgenre."
m/the_gospel_of_john," A surprisingly professional, smoothly realized adaptation...faithful to its source and sensitively translated into cinematic terms."
m/the_grace_card, Such over-the-top emotional extravagance that even Cecil B. DeMille in his silent period might not have been able to get away with it.
m/the_grace_of_jake," Still waters run not that deep in this passably pleasant, gospel-driven heartland drama."
m/the_gracefield_incident_2017," We're left with a film that, besides the hook, lacks a lot of originality. It all adds up to an experience that's not liable to leave a huge impression after it's over."
m/the_grand_budapest_hotel," Over the years, Wes Anderson's movies have steadily developed a lush, eccentric world that operates on its own terms, and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" excels at exploring it."
m/the_grand_seduction," The Grand Seduction feels made for Netflix's Watch Instantly feature - pleasant enough, but mostly forgotten with your next selection."
m/the_grandmaster, ...our high hopes can't obscure the fact that this is muddled storytelling that skitters over the surface of mysteries and psychologies that we want to plunge into and explore.
m/the_great_alaskan_race," It is certainly not a bad movie, but it is not particularly memorable either."
m/the_great_beauty," Rome in all its splendor and superficiality, artifice and significance, becomes an enormous banquet too rich to digest in one sitting in Paolo Sorrentino's densely packed, often astonishing The Great Beauty."
m/the_great_buddha," Marvelous Taiwanese study of down-and-outers' survival strategies defines ""bittersweet,"" while managing to be effin' hilarious along the way."
m/the_great_buster_a_celebration, Provides more than a CliffsNotes version on its subject.
m/the_great_escape, How can you hear that theme song and not want to watch it all over again?
m/the_great_gatsby_2013," The Great Gatsby is ultimately an epic tragedy, a parable about America, the American dream ethos and its consequences, but the movie's overblown style chokes the life out of any substance the story may have."
m/the_great_gilly_hopkins_2016, The Great Gilly Hopkins may serve as an early lesson for young readers and movie-watchers on the way that a film can be utterly faithful to its source and still not feel quite right.
m/the_great_hack, Directors Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer have assembled an engaging overview.
m/the_great_hip_hop_hoax_2013," Killer footage never emerges, just guys goofing off ..."
m/the_great_museum_2015," A pleasing, high-minded film; also something of a palate-cleanser."
m/the_great_silence_1968," Corbucci constantly subverts the generic tropes that he dabbled with two years earlier in Django, that blood-soaked and oft-imitated riff on A Fistful of Dollars."
m/the_great_train_robbery_1979," Amiable enough, but as heist films go this is well below average."
m/the_great_wall_2017," Zhang Yimou capably gives ... ""The Great Wall"" the look and feel of a Hollywood blockbuster, but his signature visual dazzle, his gift for depicting delicate relationships and throbbing passions are trampled by dead-serious epic aspirations."
m/the_great_war_2019," Mostly recycled war movie cliches, with the props - guns, explosions, etc. - occasionally giving away the paltry budget."
m/the_greatest_showman_2017," The Greatest Showman is absolutely full of it, but it will allow your head to cool off for an hour and forty-five minutes, which, this Christmas perhaps more than any other, might be exactly what you and your family need."
m/the_green_inferno," if you want an absolutely brutal experience that's tough to endure, just like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, this is probably the movie for you."
m/the_green_prince, The human journey behind a most unusual collaboration in the Middle East slowly comes into focus in this documentary.
m/the_greening_of_whitney_brown_2011, This well-intentioned family film unfortunately comes off as shallow as a prom committee meeting.
m/the_grey_2012," Joe Carnahan's film largely works, building toward a great ending, which functions as one of the best, truest action climaxes in recent memory."
m/the_grey_zone," One of the finest, most humane and important Holocaust movies ever made."
m/the_grief_of_others," This a much leaner film in terms of narrative incident than In the Family, though it paves the way for Patrick Wang to step into new artistic terrain."
m/the_grinch," Bright, both in its color palette and in the wit and liveliness of the storytelling."
m/the_ground_truth, What sets The Ground Truth apart from standard network news coverage and even previous documentary efforts is the scope of footage Foulkrod has access to.
m/the_grudge," A minimal, stylish look and sinister atmosphere support a ho-hum storyline and pedestrian script."
m/the_grudge_2020," Individual sequences of The Grudge are occasionally decent, but the film lacks forward momentum. It never stops oscillating between mildly interesting and flat-out boring"
m/the_guard_2011," A side-splitting tour de force for Brendan Gleeson, who's award worthy. If you enjoyed IN BRUGES, THE GUARD is the film for you!"
m/the_guardian_2006, Fans of Costner and Kutcher have probably forgiven them for much worse.
m/the_guardians_2018," ... perceptive and quietly absorbing, bolstered by strong performances."
m/the_guernsey_literary_and_potato_peel_pie_society," A wonderfully old-fashioned tearjerker, with a thoroughly delightful cast, where cosy quaint Englishness is leavened by a harsh reality of World War II that pop culture has ignored."
m/the_guest_2014, A hilariously badass '80s throwback that continually shifts gears and keeps you guessing to the very end
m/the_guillotines," Clearly a commentary on the shifting status of rule in modern day China, the prolific Lau's latest is nevertheless an obtuse work that buries much of its subtext and historical relevance beneath overstated dramatics and cacophonous staging."
m/the_guilt_trip," Streisand is her own once-in-a-lifetime trip, looking gawjuss with that divine voice and those killer fingernails."
m/the_guilty_2018," It's an ask, commercially: wider audiences usually express a desire to leave their office, not enter a new, smaller one, in their leisure time. But this is almost perfect for prestige cable, where connoisseurs will rightly view Möller as a name to watch."
m/the_gunman_2015," Ultimately this feels like a vanity project designed to do for Penn's bankability, Africa, Spain and mercenaries what the Taken franchise did for Liam Neeson, Paris and Albanian gangsters."
m/the_half_of_it," It's an engaging take on a tale we've seen a thousand times, as our heroine figures herself out and begins her messy quest for the one."
m/the_hallow," A creature feature, a siege movie, possession and body horror."
m/the_hand_that_rocks_the_cradle," Peyton plays upon Claire's deepest anxieties -- her sexual insecurity, her fear of child molesters -- to vicious effect. Hanson and Silver manipulate our anxieties no less adeptly, but a good deal more playfully."
m/the_handmaiden," The film is not all bad -and ensures another surprise at the end-, but by that time you'll be already tired of a story that might well have been resolved in 100 minutes without exaggerating the visual stylization. [Full review in spanish]"
m/the_hanging_garden, The director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker.
m/the_hangover_2, A soulless and badly unfunny retread of everything that worked the first time.
m/the_hangover_part_iii," Part Three is far from the glory of the first, but a reprieve from the second."
m/the_happy_house," ""The Happy House"" is nothing if not a fresh mixture of colorful characters, questionable manners, and rusty, suddenly-new-again horror conventions."
m/the_happy_prince_2018," As a final, permanent showcase for a role Everett was born to play, then, ""The Happy Prince"" does the job."
m/the_happy_sad_2013, Reducing complex relationship issues to a typical indie-flick blatherathon-complete with performances of varying quality and stilted dialogue-isn't helping anyone.
m/the_happytime_murders_2017," Some mildly amusing ideas shouldn't be full-length feature films, and The Happytime Murders falls victim to that."
m/the_harmonists," The Harmonists has a finale that will be appreciated by anyone who loved The Sound of Music. As they say, there won't be a dry eye in the house."
m/the_harvest_2015," The Harvest is a thriller that's plagued by tonal miscues, weak leading performances, and a complete lack of tension despite the film's dark, seedy nature."
m/the_hate_u_give," It's a film that contains multitudes, and only asks for a world willing to do the same."
m/the_hateful_eight," As ever with Tarantino films, however, some of the performances are lip-smackingly delicious."
m/the_hatton_garden_job," All the time there's no sense of jeopardy or drama, so you don't really care what happens either way. Stir in the polystyrene characters, as hollow as they are disposable, and it only serves to exacerbate the feeling that you're watching a bad film."
m/the_haunting_in_connecticut_2_ghosts_of_georgia," Besides having one of the worst titles in recent memory, this formulaic horror flick doesn't have much originality to boot."
m/the_haunting_of_briar_house, It's a horror film for the casual horror viewer and will most likely not scare the more dedicated genre fans.
m/the_haunting_of_sharon_tate," An oddity with an invented twist, playing out with a delirium that sometimes works. Duff is dreamy and ethereal, until the horror unfolds."
m/the_hawks_and_the_sparrows_1965," An intriguing tragicomic fable that shows two delightful innocents caught, like many Italians at the time, between the Church and communism."
m/the_head_hunter_2019," With its grubby, lived-in production design, its astonishing, desaturated locations and its perfectly sustained intensity of mood, Jordan Downey's film is like Trollhunter (2010) mixed with Valhalla Rising (2009)."
m/the_healer_2018," A film stumbling again and again while marking the notes of comedy, fantasy and drama with sound clichs. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/the_heart_machine," It showcases a genuine fascination with the mind/body split engendered by Skyping, online dating, and constant app usage through a plot that doesn't fuel itself on received wisdom."
m/the_heartbreak_kid," The Farrelly brothers seem to have run out of ideas for their big gags; in the third act, you can sense them straining to bring out the big guns while only packing a pellet gun."
m/the_heat," You know what would have been funny? If Bullock and McCarthy had switched roles... Instead, we got Miss Congeniality 3: Boston Boogaloo."
m/the_hedgehog," As oddball as the creature that inspired it, The Hedgehog warms the heart with its prickly tale."
m/the_heir_apparent_largo_winch," An exhilarating, thrilling and thoroughly suspenseful action thriller."
m/the_help," Stone, Davis and Spencer forge something quite beautiful, a sense of sisterhood and equality that unfolds with ease and grace, never feeling forced or untrue to their era and circumstances."
m/the_hero_2017," Instead of the usual page-per-minute of screen time, this film feels like a 30-page script stretched to 90-odd minutes."
m/the_high_cost_of_living_2010," Although there are moments when lead thesps Zach Braff and Isabelle Blais just about pull off the implausible conceit, the pic still suffers from major problems of tone as well as stilted camerawork and editing."
m/the_high_note," A trio of strong performances, along with some very catchy music, make all the difference here."
m/the_highwaymen," Though The Highwaymen makes sure it tells the right story about Bonnie and Clyde, it doesn't win the argument that it tells the better one."
m/the_hippopotamus," Brought to the silver screen by director John Jencks, the flavour and indelible, idiosyncratic tone of the author is imbued in this faithful adaptation."
m/the_hitmans_bodyguard," Remember 'In The Line of Fire?' CIA assassin vs. Secret Service agent? This is the haha version of that. Meh on plot and shenanigans, many belly laughs courtesy of Jackson and Reynolds."
m/the_hobbit_an_unexpected_journey," A fresh, free-spirited form of fantasy, Jackson's latest provides a younger generation with a stepping stone to his later films while serving the adult's who want more."
m/the_hobbit_the_battle_of_the_five_armies," These films, and Tolkien's entire oeuvre, are most affecting in their depictions of friendship, and the performances here represent platonic male intimacy in convincing, often moving ways."
m/the_hobbit_the_desolation_of_smaug," Middle-earth's got its mojo back. A huge improvement on the previous instalment, this takes our adventurers into uncharted territory and delivers spectacle by the ton."
m/the_hole_1964, This was Jacques Becker's last film; he died shortly after the film was released.
m/the_hole_in_the_ground," Rewrites no genre rules, but abounds in bristly calling-card atmospherics."
m/the_holiday, There is bound to be a large appreciative audience for this chick flick. But it might not be you.
m/the_hollars," This one is straight out of the old-school Sundance manual. Still, there's enough warmth, humor and heart in the very slick package, not to mention a gaggle of accomplished and well-cast actors ..."
m/the_hollow, The Hollow is a good whodunit-style suspense thriller with enough characters to make one's head spin. These are kept in order with good writing and directing as well as talented performances.
m/the_hollow_point_2016," The tragedy is that the film ... is so utterly incompetent, so inexcusably bewildering, and so bafflingly hollow."
m/the_homesman," If this is a revision to the revisionist westerns ushered in by ""Unforgiven,"" I'll stay back East(wood.)"
m/the_honeymoon_phase," The focus may be on Eve's confused experience, but every participant, by implication, is equally a rat caught in a lab maze, merely playing at being husband or wife without being sure where the happy simulacrum ends and more bitter truths settle in."
m/the_horde, The good guys and the bad guys must cooperate if they are to escape. Scenes of extreme carnage ensue.
m/the_hornets_nest_2014, The filmmakers behind The Hornet's Nest have achieved a nearly impossible task: They've made war boring.
m/the_horror_of_frankenstein_1971, A feeble attempt by Hammer to bring some freshness to its series of Frankenstein films by introducing black humor.
m/the_horror_show_1989, I'm sorry if this reads more like a financial analysis than a movie review. You have to think of something during these movies.
m/the_horseman_2008," Its take on the workings of vengeance is remarkably responsible, rooting our discomfort in its ethical challenges as much as its visceral thrills."
m/the_host_2007, Some of the film is a lot of fun. The rest is way too long.
m/the_host_2013," Like everything else brand Stephenie Meyer, The Host is a mostly empty, dull and underwhelming genre re-hash. Here's praying that poor box office makes it the last of its kind."
m/the_host_2020," Goes almost wholly wrong from that magic moment AFTER we wonder, ""Just what the Hell is going on here?"""
m/the_hot_flashes," Susan Seidelman's attempts to provide positive, alternative representations of marginalized people and problems is overly ambitious."
m/the_hours_and_times," All these years later, this landmark of Queer Cinema still has power, even if it seems downright quaint."
m/the_house_2017, Nonsensical characterizations abound throughout The House without ever dipping into unbridled absurdity.
m/the_house_i_live_in," A powerful indictment of a program that has decimated communities, cost taxpayers roughly a trillion dollars, and hasn't reduced the amount of drugs being consumed one iota."
m/the_house_of_the_devil_2009," Yet another of this year's homage-facsimiles, The House of the Devil forgoes campy self-awareness in favor of reverential faithfulness--and in doing so, implicitly critiques contemporary horror cinema."
m/the_house_of_the_spirits, The film does inherit the sweep of the novel and that helps it overcome some of its problems.
m/the_house_that_jack_built_2018," As a longtime admirer of the director's work, I can't quite believe I'm saying this, but the most shocking thing I found about The House That Jack Built is how tedious it is."
m/the_house_with_a_clock_in_its_walls," The running gags are less successful (including one about a topiary griffin with bowel issues), but the script's sharper jokes more than make up for those."
m/the_housemaid, The film creates an effective atmosphere of brooding erotic menace without over-stepping the mark by becoming clumsy or ham-fisted.
m/the_housemaid_2018," Although not particularly original in its recycling of familiar genre tropes, the stylish film should well satisfy horror aficionados while engaging more general audiences as well."
m/the_houses_october_built," The Houses October Built"" proves one of the more successful attempts at the found-footage horror flick since Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones."
m/the_houses_october_built_2, Content to send the same characters down the same path with what appears on the surface to be the same results.
m/the_human_centipede_ii," Like the original, the most shocking aspect comes from the revelation that Six can actually tell a story."
m/the_human_centipede_iii," No one should be forced to endure such garbage-not Six's actors or his crew and certainly not moviegoers (or even critics, for that matter)."
m/the_human_comedy_1943," Since Mickey Rooney was then at the height of his popularity, many viewers saw it as just another episode of the Andy Hardy series, but it was actually a bittersweet small-town saga, in the vein of Capra, dealing with the inevitable loss of innocence"
m/the_human_experiment, A cautionary expose' making a convincing argument that consumers would be very wise to learn all they can about the ingredients in the products they buy.
m/the_human_race_2012, a bleak and often bloody portrait of humanity as a plaything for drives and forces beyond its comprehension or control.
m/the_human_resources_manager," A title infused with an irony encapsulating this bittersweet and darkly laced satire. And a murky odyssey into euphemisms that tend to define the universal workplace, where humane gestures more often than not protect the bosses, rather than the workers."
m/the_human_scale_2013," Like many movies looking at the effects of globalization on the human condition, Dalsgaard looks at the ways today's cities are destroying our quality of life."
m/the_humbling," Such inept, shuffling nonsense that an apter title might have been The Bumbling."
m/the_hummingbird_project," The Hummingbird Project manages to grab the audience by examining a pair of determined workers while giving them questions to ask about technology, money and family."
m/the_hunchback_of_notre_dame_ii, Devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special.
m/the_hundred_foot_journey," The Hundred-Foot Journey feels like a 500 mile walk, traveling down the same ""uplifting"" road so many heartwarming tales have previously explored."
m/the_hunger, Tepid vampire fare is really notable only for being Tony Scott's first major movie and for its steamy love scene between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon.
m/the_hunger_games," Ross and crew succeed in converting Collins' best-selling text to the screen, and fans should reward their efforts. When it comes to The Hunger Games, the odds are ever in this film's favor."
m/the_hunger_games_catching_fire," Those who understand the outrage that powers the books should ... appreciate the blunt way it embraces Collins' cautionary vision of how a ruthless, privileged few can keep the masses down by dividing them and entertaining them ..."
m/the_hunger_games_mockingjay_part_1," I wait with almost-bated breath for part two, a year from now. But I wish I didn't have to."
m/the_hunger_games_mockingjay_part_2, An emotional gut-punch of a film that's a fitting send-off for one of modern-day cinema's great heroines.
m/the_hungry_ghosts_2009," Thirty-six hours. Multiple characters. Interlocking narratives. Michael Imperioli's Manhattan-set film-directing debut hits plenty of familiar notes, almost all of them off-key."
m/the_hunt_2012," The Hunt may have been too see-through for me to truly enjoy it, but Vinterberg has crafted a very good movie here."
m/the_hunt_2013," The Hunt is a ""problem picture"" in which the problem feels neither urgent nor especially new."
m/the_hunt_2020," Mostly dreadful, offering an underwhelming sense of humor and horror, perhaps revealing that any release delay wasn't ordered due to fear, but out of growing shame."
m/the_hunter_2012, There is an elegiac quality to The Hunter that makes it intoxicating in spite of its faults.
m/the_hunters_prayer," The Hunter's Prayer is too familiar and formulaic to work in any significant or even trivial way, but it's so inconsequential that it's impossible to fault the movie too much."
m/the_hunting_ground_2015," ... the emotional weight is again there for an effective issue film, but it's difficult to recommend on that alone when the style and structure of the doc is so standard and sometimes just plain sloppy."
m/the_hunting_of_the_president, a passionate and worthy assault on an ugly period in our history
m/the_hunting_party," Miss Bergen, mostly without tricks and without reservations, plainly succeeds with a part that is not so much a character as a test of character."
m/the_huntsman_winters_war," Visual inventiveness and spectacular casting can't quite salvage a muddled fantasy epic that, if it were a magic mirror, would be held together with gaffer tape."
m/the_hurricane_heist," If the words ""hurricane"" and ""heist"" translate into the words ""must"" and ""see"", this is the movie for you."
m/the_hurt_locker," Tensely action-packed and muscularly directed by Kathryn Bigelow, this tale of an elite U.S. army bomb disposal unit in Baghdad is a familiar story in new clothes, targeted at the young male demographic."
m/the_hustle_2019, Could swindle a few dollars out of its unsuspecting viewers but its attempt to win big comes up a bust as we've ultimately seen all these tricks before.
m/the_ice_cream_truck, A middle-aged woman who had married young and yearns to re-live her high-school days gets more than she bargained for at the hands of a horny 18-year-old and an old-fashioned ice cream man.
m/the_iceman_2013," Michael Shannon embodies Kuklinski down to the bone: there are shades of Paul Muni's Scarface in his lighter moments, although for most of the film he looks as if his face might have been hewn from granite."
m/the_identical," The Identical gets the job done adequately enough. This passably palatable film never hits any real high notes, however."
m/the_ides_of_march," Classy and professional throughout, the technical work gracefully holds all the threads together."
m/the_illusionist-2009," The lovely Edinburgh backdrops, shot with marvellous attention to light and weather conditions, only partially compensate for a story that's sluggish and uninvolving."
m/the_imaginarium_of_doctor_parnassus," The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a film with a huge heart and a dazzling eye, but it does little for the very thing it is trying to celebrate: the imagination."
m/the_imitation_game," The movie is undeniably strong in its sense of a bright light burned out too soon, and the often undignified fate of those who dare to chafe at society's established norms."
m/the_immigrant_2014, It's just a shame that Cotillard's impressive performance isn't hung on a more vibrant story.
m/the_immortalists," Even if it doesn't convince us they're likely to conquer death before it comes for them, the film does prompt interesting debates about just how desirable an unlimited stay on Planet Earth would be."
m/the_impossible_2012," With a decidedly Spielbergian flair, the theme of altruism takes on great meaning through the other side of this tragedy and the characters bring emotional closure to more than just their own triumphs."
m/the_imposter_2012," Impressively directed and skilfully edited, this is an utterly riveting true crime documentary that exerts a powerful grip and is by turns chilling, shocking and disturbing. It's also one of the best films of the year."
m/the_in_laws_1979, The teaming of Alan Arkin with Peter Falk was inspired casting.
m/the_inbetweeners," Updates the teen summer holiday formula surprisingly entertainingly, considering it doesn't subvert it one iota."
m/the_incomparable_rose_hartman," Pushy, judgmental, tart-tongued and self-obsessed, the photographer at the heart of Otis Mass's penetrating documentary, ""The Incomparable Rose Hartman,"" is, like her snapshots, a piece of work."
m/the_incredible_burt_wonderstone," The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is by no means an awful film, and it does have some genuinely funny moments, it just offers nothing new and comes off as stale and recycled for the most part."
m/the_incredible_hulk, Should please the targeted audience in their teens and twenties who escape into the air-conditioned multiplex from a June heat wave.
m/the_incredible_jessica_james," A comedy centered around a multi-dimensional African-American woman who is smart, funny, vulnerable, sensual, charming, flawed, resilient, well-educated, an inspiring teacher and a loving friend feels almost like the cinematic equivalent of a unicorn."
m/the_indian_runner," Penn's generosity to his actors is welcome, and Mortensen and Morse make the most of it with substantial performances, but a tighter reign might have livened up a film that at times becomes a little ponderous."
m/the_inevitable_defeat_of_mister_and_pete," Tillman seems to know that we need to go home feeling hope for Mister and Pete, who, it turns out, aren't so easily defeated."
m/the_infidel," Thankfully, the sometimes muddled message on religion is propped up by good gags, such as a running joke about hating people who do quotation marks with their fingers."
m/the_infiltrator, It's a no-nonsense crime procedural that suits its hero.
m/the_infiltrators," Despite all its importance this is, at its core, almost a popcorn movie."
m/the_innkeepers, A decidedly old-fashioned haunted-house movie that sidesteps boredom with banter.
m/the_innocent_1979, The Innocent is fulsomely stamped with Visconti's style -- seldom has such lumbering been made to look so lovely. But the movie's blood runs cold: it's wordy and ponderous.
m/the_institute_2017, The tedious film traverses familiar lurid territory involving resourceful heroines and corrupt doctors.
m/the_insult," It's a bold and timely play with fire, but also a sensitive, good-humoured probe into human weakness - especially of the male kind."
m/the_intended," It's a moderately creepy, man-beyond- civilization exercise that can't decide whether it's arty or scary, and thus ends up being neither."
m/the_intern, The Intern capitalises on the believable chemistry between Hathaway and De Niro to produce a rom com that is genuinely satisfying.
m/the_internets_own_boy_the_story_of_aaron_swartz," A really wonky documentary and it's full of smart, socially awkward people trying to make it easy to process the case's key jargon."
m/the_internship_2013, The film meanders agreeably enough through its predictable plot but takes a bit too much time out for facile life lessons and admiring depictions of Google's corporate culture.
m/the_interrupters_2011, certainly the best documentary I've seen thus far this year
m/the_intervention," While The Intervention tastes vanilla, there's enough flavor here to keep wanting more from DuVall. Despite its flaws, the film still manages to win you over, even if it never actually surprises you, making it quite an assured debut."
m/the_interview_2014," The Interview fails to live up to the hype, floundering as a rowdy comedy as it grows duller by the minute."
m/the_intouchables," Though never known for their subtlety, French co-helmers/scripters Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache have never delivered a film as offensive as Untouchable."
m/the_intruder_2019," Overall,The Intruderis a solid home invasion, no more and no less. If you're looking for one of those, head to the theater this weekend for creepy Dennis Quaid."
m/the_intruders_2015," The Intruders stacks the deck with all the familiar horror signposts, as if straying from clichés were the most frightening thing of all."
m/the_inventor_out_for_blood_in_silicon_valley, It's more entertaining than reading a Wikipedia entry but nevertheless stays pretty bland throughout.
m/the_invisible_man_2020, This Invisible Man is not entertainment; it's merely a domestic-violence showcase for masochists.
m/the_invisible_war, An aptly infuriating expose of sexual abuse within the U.S. military.
m/the_invisible_woman_2013," Ralph Fiennes has rarely been better than he is as the 19th century's most celebrated novelist, with his chops on screen just about matched by what he's done behind."
m/the_invitation, A dinner-party mystery so sweat-inducingly tense that I could only watch it through laced fingers.
m/the_iran_job," This is a complicated, accessible and heartfelt human drama, one that Obama, Romney and Americans of all political stripes should see ..."
m/the_irishman, I heard all sorts of huzzahs about Pacino - and he is wonderful - but it's Pesci who thrilled me to the core.
m/the_iron_ladies_2001, Pick any underdog sports film and re-imagine its cast of cliched archetypes as nelly drag queens and you have the offensive Ladies in a pink nutshell.
m/the_iron_lady," A breezy, whistle-stop tour through the unstable nitroglycerin of Thatcher's life and times."
m/the_iron_ministry," The parallel tracks of railways and cinema profitably converge yet again in J.P.Sniadecki's outstanding, semi-experimental documentary The Iron Ministry, a pungently immersive evocation of traveling on Chinese trains."
m/the_island_2007, Stunning to look at and ambitious in its symbolic rendering of the subject.
m/the_island_at_the_top_of_the_world, So-so Disney spectacle with not so special effects.
m/the_island_president," Nasheed may be a small fish in a big geopolitical pond, but his enterprise and optimism are a welcome complement to eco doc doom and gloom."
m/the_ivory_game," There are moments when the movie tugs at your heart, but the subject matter, because it's so epic, deserves an even more probing and definitive treatment."
m/the_jaundiced_eye_2000, An uninventive but harrowing report from the front lines of a society whose attitudes toward homosexuality are changing faster than some might like -- but not quite fast enough to really make it count for others.
m/the_jeffrey_dahmer_files," I'm not sure that director and co-writer Chris James Thompson's film sheds any new light on why Dahmer committed his crimes, but I'm also not sure that anything is gained by trying to look too deeply into such a disordered personality."
m/the_jetsons, Jetsons: The Movie is nothing less than a master plan for Utopia. Your children may never be the same.
m/the_jewish_cardinal," Informative, absorbing, but as obvious as its title and a bit too glib for its own good, this French import will appeal mainly to religious addicts fascinated by the feverishly agenda-ridden internal workings of the Catholic Church."
m/the_jimmy_show," There's an admirable rigor to Jimmy's relentless anger, and to the script's refusal of a happy ending, but as those monologues stretch on and on, you realize there's no place for this story to go but down."
m/the_journey_2017," The Journey is an apocryphal drama about the Northern Irish peace process, and makes its subject look like a methodical tootle around the block by comparison."
m/the_judge_2014," Even when the circumstances seem contrived, the actors mine moments of truth that resonate with raw emotion."
m/the_jungle_book_2016," Disney's live-action reimagining of The Jungle Book might not be quite as small-child-friendly as the 1967 animated version, but it is still a solid family movie."
m/the_karate_kid_part_iii," Morita, who was Oscar-nominated for the original, remains a likable stick figure, but Macchio has gone from cute to typecast here, his waifish charm turned to gawky adulthood."
m/the_keeper_of_lost_causes," The Keeper of Lost Causes had the format, the aesthetic, the supporting characters and the grizzly torture; unfortunately all orbiting a Thunderbird marionette."
m/the_keeping_hours," The film is a moving and emotional journey, and even manages a jump scare or two for healthy measure."
m/the_kid, Anyone who still doubts that Bruce Willis is one of the best actors working in films today should check out how he punches up this fluffy fantasy about a midlife crisis.
m/the_kid_2019," The first major Billy the Kid movie since Young Guns II, this rough, sturdy Western is unflinchingly brutal. But it also offers thoughtful ruminations on the nature of violence and its repercussions."
m/the_kid_brother," The first silent film I ever saw that made me actually stand up and cheer As a first introduction to silent film, I would pick The Kid Brother over the best of Chaplin or Keaton every time."
m/the_kid_who_would_be_king," A likable enough, Amblin-esque update to the classic Arthurian legend..."
m/the_kid_with_a_bike," There are flaws, and yet the Dardennes' tough, spare, almost haunted storytelling style was much in evidence."
m/the_kidnapping_of_michel_houellebecq_2015," A divertingly eccentric, often comically absurd movie about a novelist ... who finds something like happiness after being abducted."
m/the_kids_grow_up," Stands out as one of the best documentaries ever made about the important transition of leaving home, a tricky and complicated stretch of time for parents and their offspring."
m/the_kill_hole, Boseman and Kittles somehow push past the blather to reveal the inconsolable grief and fury that so often haunts our vets.
m/the_kill_team," ""The Kill Team"" is emotionally heavy; as you watch, you feel conflicted about Winfield's role and about your own perception of right and wrong."
m/the_kill_team_2019," Edited down to 87 minutes, the footage is never attractive, the performances are only decent and the emotion never runs deep. Still, this film tells a powerful story."
m/the_killer_inside_me," A bit too silly for its own good ... Yet even if this is my least favorite Winterbottom since 9 Songs, I'd be lying if I said I don't appreciate the effort."
m/the_killing_of_a_sacred_deer," You'll feel deeply uncomfortable while watching, but in a twistedly enjoyable way."
m/the_kindergarten_teacher, The film's denouement is at once shocking and organic because it echoes a well-paced but nasty children's fable.
m/the_kindergarten_teacher_2018, Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a superbly enigmatic performance.
m/the_kindness_of_strangers_2019," The capable actors do what they can, but audiences are more likely to glaze over than share the qualities of mercy and compassion so dutifully stitched into this diagrammatic patchwork."
m/the_king_2006," The story of a veritable devil who comes to test and destroy a family of faith, The King is a noxious film morally and an aggravating one dramatically."
m/the_king_2019," Chalamet scowlingly hints at a slow-burning inner violence, but he doesn't have enough variety to his facial and vocal repertoire to make his character really breathe, either as Henry or Hal."
m/the_king_is_alive," A bit grim, but the experience, story, and performances are of a high-enough caliber to warrant a recommendation."
m/the_king_of_masks_1999," A new Chinese film of simplicity, beauty and surprising emotional power."
m/the_king_of_staten_island, Judd Apatow scores another home run with the dramady that features Pete Davidson showing more range as the MVP. A great supporting cast and the right blend of laughs and sentiment.
m/the_kingdom," A generic war movie with the usual rapid editing, jerky camera movements, and confusion exacerbated by the film's cut from 150 minutes to its present 110."
m/the_kingdom_of_dreams_and_madness, Future generations may be as grateful for its footage of Hayao Miyazaki sketching as we now are of early Beatles Super 8 films.
m/the_kings_choice," Erik Poppe's beautifully calibrated historical drama is immersive and impressive, both for its authenticity and its story telling power."
m/the_kings_of_summer, Toy's House is what Moonrise Kingdom might have been like if the director's played-out style and monotone quirkiness had not interfered with its similar tale.
m/the_kings_speech, The King's Speech is one of the most pleasurable movies to come along in years.
m/the_kissing_booth," In another film, the sentiment would be a romantic one. In The Kissing Booth, it feels like a cage."
m/the_kitchen," Despite the trio of women kicking ass, The Kitchen simply never becomes the feminist thriller that we need it to be."
m/the_knight_before_christmas," The Knight Before Christmas doesn't reinvent the Christmas rom-com genre, but there's a surprising amount to love about the film. You can't help but admire the film's sense of earnestness and its message about love and empathy."
m/the_knot_2012, Relies too heavily on gross-out gags and laddish humour and fails to provide either likeable characters or believeable relationships.
m/the_la_riot_spectacular," [T]he most riotous, raucous, rowdy, ribald and uproariously funniest satire to hit theaters in years. And I admit right now, I had to see it four times to hear all the jokes because I was laughing so hard."
m/the_ladies_man," Nicely mounted, interestingly done, but typically unfunny Lewis."
m/the_lady_2011," ""Democracy takes time,"" a character observes in ""The Lady,"" though viewers of all political stripes will be checking their watches during Luc Besson's dully conventional tribute to heroic Burmese activist Aung San Suu Kyi."
m/the_lady_from_shanghai," An uneven film, perhaps, but one which only seems to improve with age."
m/the_lady_in_the_van," Smith brilliantly re-creates her stage role in Alan Bennett's autobiographical play about Miss Shepherd, a dotty and stubborn former nun who says the Virgin Mary advised her to park her overstuffed van in the playwright's unused driveway in 1974."
m/the_land_2016, An at-risk youth movie we've seen many times before in more authentic versions.
m/the_land_of_steady_habits," Really bad decisions are made, people lie, no one convincingly grows. Lest this be taken as biting commentary, the music, stilted dialogue and epilogue assure us it's in earnest."
m/the_last_5_years," The Last 5 Years has some catchy tunes, a clever structure, and Anna Kendrick. When it comes to breezy romantic musicals, it's hard to ask for much more."
m/the_last_black_man_in_san_francisco, As much as the filmmakers hate what's happened to their hometown the love is still there in abundance.
m/the_last_days," A high-profile Spanish project that's uneven on every level except technique, the watchable but forgettable ""The Last Days"" finds helmers Alex and David Pastor failing to deliver on the promise of their 2009 English-language debut, ""Carriers."""
m/the_last_days_on_mars, A study of just how to screw up what ought to be an awesome movie.
m/the_last_dragon, Howlingly goofy artifact from the silliest part of the 1980s.
m/the_last_exorcism_part_ii_2013, The avian-suicide thing wasn't that scary when we saw it last week in Dark Skies.
m/the_last_face_2017," Not only does it have good intentions, this is a terrifying film. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/the_last_full_measure, It's an emotional tale about sacrificing yourself to do something better.
m/the_last_gladiators_2011," Makes room for tender moments of reflection from a guy who, against impossible odds, still managed some victories, the biggest of which may be that he's still standing."
m/the_last_heist," You've seen this heist movie a thousand times before, and not even an eye-snatching serial killer can liven up such archaic plotting."
m/the_last_impresario," For all the film's shortcomings, White's story does ultimately shine through."
m/the_last_king_2016," The cinematic essentials are represented, delivering big action in a rarely explored setting, successfully transforming this slice of warfare into a compelling, wonderfully snowbound adventure."
m/the_last_laugh, The Last Laugh can really best be understood as a horror story.
m/the_last_laugh_2019," Despite the film's flaws, you can't help rooting for Dreyfuss and Chase."
m/the_last_lions," Doubling as cinematographer, Dereck Joubert skillfully integrates slow-motion and creates a rich sense of space with godlike long shots."
m/the_last_man_on_the_moon," Spellbinding! A vital, wondrous piece of history is beautifully preserved."
m/the_last_metro," As a portrait of a time, Last Metro is a warmly performed and deftly shot trifle."
m/the_last_mountain, Director and co-writer Bill Haney lacks a sense of poetry about the documentary form and opts for something closer to a sledgehammer approach.
m/the_last_movie_star_2018, Whatever pathos is generated comes from Reynolds's commitment to all the self-exploitation. His inimitable charm is still there beneath all the corporeal decrepitude on which Rifkin and company shamelessly linger.
m/the_last_of_robin_hood," Holding the enterprise back, however, is a terribly restrained directorial approach and academic visual style that prevent the lubricious story from truly coming to life."
m/the_last_of_the_unjust," With each new look come new questions, and harder answers."
m/the_last_photograph_2017," A thriller, character study, and, to a lesser extent, coming of age romance. Yet it seamlessly balances all these elements to craft a story that grips as powerfully with its visuals as it does emotionally."
m/the_last_race_2018, Photographer Michael Dweck captures a vanishing piece of Americana.
m/the_last_ride_2011," At least Thomas gives a suitably burned-out performance as Williams. He's almost enough to melt your cold, cold heart."
m/the_last_rites_of_joe_may," Dennis Farina's washed-up hustler in The Last Rites of Joe May is designed in the in the mold of a classic movie star tough guy, but the veteran character actor's performance also serves to disassemble it."
m/the_last_seduction," A movie that is not only ingenious and entertaining, but liberating, because we can sense the story isn't going to be twisted into conformity with some stupid formula."
m/the_last_sentence," [The film] offers a potentially intriguing study in high-minded political/moral obstinacy, but feels too claustrophobic -- and, finally, tediously like a one-man window on great events -- to fully come to dramatic life."
m/the_last_sharknado_its_about_time, A film in which all the wit and ingenuity on hand appears to have been squandered on coming up with the title.
m/the_last_shot," instead of a sharp satiric edge, there is the dull thud of overripe tomatoes hitting the pavement"
m/the_last_starfighter," It's not an award-winner or cult classic, but The Last Starfighter is certainly one of the coolest ""cable flicks"" you're likely to come across."
m/the_last_suit," [Pablo] Solarz may be able to claim that it is based on a true story, but drama requires more than that."
m/the_last_summer_2019," A pretty but lifeless and witless confection, out of character for Netflix -- which has a decent track record in the genre."
m/the_last_survivors, The kind of serviceable yet lovingly crafted indie genre picture you wish was made more often.
m/the_last_thing_he_wanted, The film turns out to be an incoherent mess of the highest order.
m/the_last_waltz_1978, A mesmerizing time capsule that captures the voice of the '60s counterculture at the very moment it was about to pass from the center stage of American life.
m/the_last_witch_hunter," stumbles out of the gate, falls, and never rights itself. For the Halloween offering that its studio hoped it would be, it's all trick and no treat."
m/the_last_word_2017," MacLaine has something that shines through and elevates a film like this one. The movie is prefab indie whimsy, but she gives it an afterglow."
m/the_late_bloomer_2016," Though Pollak's direction in his first narrative feature is solid, The Late Bloomer is mostly an excuse for predictable sex jokes and ample toplessness."
m/the_laundromat, Flails about with an excess of bad ideas that undercut the justifiable outrage over the events depicted.
m/the_law_in_these_parts_2012, The Law in These Parts applies a cold anger to one of the geopolitical world's most passionate discords.
m/the_laws_of_thermodynamics," It's formula is so repetitive, it's exhausting. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/the_layover," The film was clearly conceived and written by men who have no interest in approaching female friendships with any degree of complexity, curiosity, or respect."
m/the_lazarus_effect," There is a crafty, creepy, provocative film lurking inside of ""The Lazarus Effect,"" but, alas, it never comes out to play."
m/the_league_of_gentlemen, The League of Gentlemen is a fine example of old-fashioned English humor: droll and civil.
m/the_ledge, Chapman's sincerity is undercut by the crudely melodramatic explanations of why his principals believe as they do.
m/the_legacy_of_a_whitetail_deer_hunter," To be frank, The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter is definitely the worst film Hill and McBride have made together, but if you're a longtime fan, there's still plenty to giggle at here."
m/the_legend_of_420," A decent, highly informational doc that takes a lighter look at a subject some might take far more seriously than others."
m/the_legend_of_ben_hall," Often the word ""legend"" in a film title can be a fairly good indicator that you're not in for a breezy frolic, but that still doesn't prepare you for the ponderously protracted slog that is ""The Legend of Ben Hall."""
m/the_legend_of_cocaine_island," If White Tide feels finessed, in other words, well, that's because it is to an extent. But it's also real, as told from the mouths of the people whose experiences provide its bedrock."
m/the_legend_of_hercules," There's just so little to be enthusiastic about a film so laughingly bad and perfectly underwhelming. On the bright side, we've already got a strong contender for worst film of the year."
m/the_legend_of_tarzan," Tarzan is too dull to offer consistent pulp excitement, too self-serious to let itself have fun, and too reliant on same-y CG spectacle to truly thrill."
m/the_lego_batman_movie," There are around four (great) films' worth of action and jokes here, crammed into a story so streamlined it might have been assembled in the Lockheed wind tunnel."
m/the_lego_movie," From its opening frame to its surprisingly heartfelt conclusion, 'The LEGO Movie' has a bright and brash, candy-colored go go go dynamism that crackles with a glorious alacrity set to the tempo of the classroom's biggest and most disruptive spaz."
m/the_lego_movie_2_the_second_part," If not quite unforgettable, The Lego Movie 2 leaves the memory of a good time."
m/the_lego_ninjago_movie," An alternately high-octane, hilarious and heartwarming cinematic treat that's hard to beat!"
m/the_leisure_seeker," Cluttered with clichés and stalled in softness, pot-holed by its self-serving use of Alzheimer's as a narrative convenience."
m/the_leopard_1963," The Leopard was written by the only man who could have written it, directed by the only man who could have directed it, and stars the only man who could have played its title character."
m/the_lesser_blessed, A decently acted coming-of-age drama that scores points for its setting -- a Canadian Indian reservation high school.
m/the_letters_2015," A fatuous argument for Mother Teresa's sainthood; credulous and willfully ignorant, and disregards everything about her beliefs that was nasty or skeptical."
m/the_levelling," The Levelling hits peaks and troughs which make this plucky British indie an arresting, affecting watch."
m/the_liability_2013," A flawed but interesting downbeat Brit thriller with some creepy, leftfield jolts, calling to mind Mike Hodges with a twist of Tarantino."
m/the_liberator_2014," Well mounted and cast, The Liberator has all the right surface attributes yet never quite transcends its solid, slightly impersonal professionalism."
m/the_lie_2011, A film about accountability that repeatedly absolves its lead character of the need to have any.
m/the_life_and_times_of_hank_greenberg, The film opens and closes with the Marx Brothers singing 'Take Me Out to the Ballgame' in Yiddish. And how could you resist something like that?
m/the_lifeguard," Even if it had the courage of its convictions, The Lifeguard would still be hampered by its commitment to cliché."
m/the_light_between_oceans," Derek Cianfrance can't quite thread the needle between John Cassavetes and David Lean, but it's fun to watch him try."
m/the_lighthouse_2019," Eggers leans hard into the Kubrick vibe, but unlike his many peers attempting the same, he has the narrative originality and technical expertise to see it through."
m/the_limehouse_golem," As busy and artificial as Victorian interior decor at its most excessive, ""The Limehouse Golem"" is similarly rather too much of a posh good thing."
m/the_lion_king," The entire film is loaded with eye-popping visuals, which, even on a second viewing, never fail to mesmerize."
m/the_lion_king_2019," Every story comes down to the quality of its interpretation, and the stunning visual splendor of this rendition tells this story beautifully and dynamically."
m/the_lion_king_ii_simbas_pride," It's a fun story that actually gives something more to the characters than most sequels do, from the animated Disney line or not."
m/the_lion_of_judah, The Lion of Judah turns out to be a lamb and this Bible story with animals turns out to be exceedingly lame.
m/the_little_death_2014," Australian actor Josh Lawson writes, directs and appears in this middling ensemble comedy about the wacky sex lives of four suburban couples."
m/the_little_hours," It's funny and inventive. At 80 minutes long, it knows its limitations."
m/the_little_mermaid_1989," If you don't leave the theater humming, then you'd better check the adjustment on your hearing aid."
m/the_little_stranger_2018," There are certainly a few instances of genuine terror throughout, but its horrors are every bit as allegorical as literal."
m/the_little_vampire_3d, It's perfectly passable half-term entertainment but has no bite or distinctiveness whatsoever.
m/the_lives_of_others," A stunning, even electrifying view of communism in EastGermany as a soulless regime."
m/the_living_2014," The Living could be something kind of interesting, if only it weren't trying so hard to emotionally goad its audience."
m/the_living_end, Probably more valuable as a cultural artifact than a movie.
m/the_lobster," The Lobster is as weird and wonderful as it sounds and will make you think twice before asking the dreaded question, 'Are you still single?'"
m/the_lodgers," As a ripe chunk of pure baroque atmosphere, this lushly staged costume chiller is a fragrant beauty indeed."
m/the_loft," Dissipating with every turn of the screw and ending in an undeservedly too-nice, too-neat denouement, ""The Loft"" is akin to a hollow shellattractive on the outside, and empty where it counts."
m/the_lone_ranger," The Lone Ranger is a tonally imbalanced Western adventure, but random comedic gems mixed with the perfect dose of Depp make this franchise reawakening a serviceable cinematic escape."
m/the_loneliest_planet," The title is a play on those Lonely Planet travel guides, but it's also a fair description of the desolate space in which each of the movie's three characters resides."
m/the_lonely_island_presents_the_unauthorized_bash_brothers_experience," If anything, TUBBE exists as a wildcard example of funny dudes making something for shits and guaranteed giggles."
m/the_long_dumb_road," When a movie is forcing you to question what you liked its stars in before, you know it's gone way off the beaten path."
m/the_long_good_friday," The Long Good Friday boasts a smart, streetwise script by Barrie Keefe to go along with a handful of incendiary performances."
m/the_longest_ride," Brazenly vanilla for a Sparks adaptation, The Longest Ride modestly captures the dull comfort of old-fashioned romance."
m/the_longest_week, Good performances can't save a very derivative film.
m/the_look_of_love_2013, It's an enjoyable way to spend a couple hours. But don't expect to learn anything deeper of Raymond's life than what can be gleaned from his Wikipedia page.
m/the_look_of_silence, What we hear is shocking enough; thankfully Oppenheimer leaves most of these savage horrors to our imagination.
m/the_lorax_2012," With a small handful of musical numbers and a likable hero in the form of Ted, you can do much worse than this when it comes to a family friendly feature."
m/the_lord_of_the_rings_the_fellowship_of_the_ring, So well-made and well-cast that one can have no reservations about the rest of Jackson's monumental creation.
m/the_lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king," You could open an entire can of hyperbole over this film, and still run short of adjectives to praise its majesty."
m/the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers," A visual pageant of sorcery and action, all but surpasses The Fellowship of the Ring."
m/the_lords_of_salem," One alluring thing about Zombie is that it's hard to know how much of all this is a put-on. I spent a lot of time squinting at it, which is more fun than being bored."
m/the_lost_bladesman," An epic historical martial arts film with thin characters, a tepid love story and some excellent fight sequences with the long-handled crescent-moon blade."
m/the_lost_city_of_z," Despite gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast, The Lost City of Z is a shallow and overly romantic film that falls into the trap of hero worship."
m/the_lost_husband," Just an easy to watch, easy to enjoy kind of movie. In this day and age something simple and nice is just what the doctor ordered."
m/the_love_letter, The film's construction is clumsy and the sentiments a little corny.
m/the_love_punch_2013," Brosnan and Thompson seem hell-bent on a good time, but Joel Hopkins' broad, lazy script is no sparkler."
m/the_love_we_make," Terrific star-packed documentary takes viewers onstage, backstage, into car-service back seats and onto New York streets with Paul McCartney just after 9/11 as he muses warmly and wisely..."
m/the_love_witch," all this [visual attractiveness] is part of the film's seductive artifice, fashioned to mesmerise the viewer in much the way that witch protagonist Elaine uses makeup, dress and wig to lure male lovers by reflecting their fantasies."
m/the_loved_ones_2012," A squeamishly self-aware bloodbath in which Lola, superbly portrayed by Robin McLeavy with hellish zeal, reveals her ambition to be the next Hannibal Lecter."
m/the_lovers_2015," Instead of evolving into intriguing lunacy, ""The Lovers"" loses a critical battle with coherency."
m/the_lovers_and_the_despot," It's one hell of a yarn, which makes The Lovers and the Despot's strangely soporific style something of a disappointment."
m/the_loving_story," The verite footage from the time is a real blessing and the documentary's primary cinematic attraction. The rest, though, is occasionally its technical distraction."
m/the_lucky_one_2012," The setting may be tranquil, but the underlying emotions expressed in Nicholas Sparks' novel are anything but, with complex themes involving relationships, passions and unresolved issues"
m/the_lunchbox," We're barely into the new year and one of the top ten films of 2014 has already arrived . . . .Experiencing Lunchbox is like being exposed to your first Truffaut. You know here's an artist you're going to have a long, prosperous relationship with."
m/the_machine_2013," Former dancer Caity Lotz is good at lethal kicks and twitchy cyborg movements, but her ingenue manner and baby-doll voice don't make her any more convincing as a cybernetics genius than as a robo-femme super-soldier."
m/the_machine_which_makes_everything_disappear," Director Tinatin Gurchiani offers a snapshot of her Georgian homeland, but she also taps into universal concerns about family, separation and identity."
m/the_mackintosh_man," The movie is irritating in its refusal to make things clear; if spy movies are going to work like clockwork, they have to be put together with some care."
m/the_maestro," The earnest but very modest pic will play best with film-score buffs, though most in that community will wish for a bigger focus (or any, really) on their heroes."
m/the_magic_christian," It's too long and too silly (""Very silly indeed!"") to work in the long run, so feel free to start and stop it at will -- you won't miss a thing."
m/the_magic_of_belle_isle," Too schmaltzy, but so what? See it for Morgan Freeman's performance."
m/the_magician_1958," The movie has elements of Gothic horror and philosophy, along with lusty, low comedy rolls."
m/the_magnificent_seven_2016, A fun reboot of the classic ensemble western. Denzel Washington is at his best as the gun-slinging leader.
m/the_main_event_2020," Through clever subversions of tired kid-movie tropes and a whole lot of heart, The Main Event stands out as one of the most genuinely endearing titles on the platform."
m/the_man_from_earth_holocene," The Man From Earth: Holocene is a sequel that is quite enjoyable, but admittedly not as strong as the first classic film."
m/the_man_from_london," Feels like no other film that you've seen before. It's cerebral and lugubrious, yet simple as a fairy tale."
m/the_man_from_uncle, Leaves you in a place where you'll be dying to see more of these characters.
m/the_man_nobody_knew_in_search_of_my_father_cia_spymaster_william_colby," Carl Colby's smart, fact-packed film ""The Man Nobody Knew"" operates on many levels, all riveting."
m/the_man_on_the_train, It's a slight premise given substance by the thoughtful dialogue and performances.
m/the_man_standing_next, Woo's screenplay is clever in the way it uses ... [a] straightforward premise ... as a hook for the deeper and more troubling elements of this story.
m/the_man_who_invented_christmas," As lightweight as this movie is, at least ""The Man Who Invented Christmas"" builds on the traditional tale in a new way."
m/the_man_who_killed_don_quixote," Neither as bad as you fear nor as good as it deserves to be given the sheer effort of will that went into getting it made, it is enough that The Man Who Killed Don Quixote lives."
m/the_man_who_killed_hitler_and_then_the_bigfoot, Mythic and meaningful. A special work that hits you in unexpected ways. Sam Elliott gives yet another stellar performance.
m/the_man_who_knew_infinity, The film is unashamedly middle-brow and sentimental but it tells such a good story that it is hard to resist.
m/the_man_who_knew_too_much," The earlier version scores two great points over its remake. One, of course, is Peter Lorre's brilliant, wheedling turn as the oleaginous Mr Abbott. The other is its climax."
m/the_man_who_knew_too_much_1956, It's hugely entertaining and exceptionally involving.
m/the_man_who_shook_the_hand_of_vicente_fernandez," It gives film fans the chance to see the late Ernest Borgnine in his last acting gig and to see that he clearly relished every opportunity to perform. Unfortunately, the film surrounding him is a pulseless homage to spaghetti westerns."
m/the_man_with_the_golden_arm," Proves that drug stories aren't exclusively the territory of hip, nihilistic '90s film-school wunderkinder."
m/the_man_with_the_iron_fists," The chop-socky wire-fu scenes are beautifully choreographed, but pretty crudely edited; despite its gourmet neo-grindhouse trappings, the film won't bring the heat like you've never seen before."
m/the_mandela_effect," A fascinating, if heartless, failure, skimming the surface of the conspiracy, not doing justice to the tragedy."
m/the_marriage_of_maria_braun," Though Fassbinder takes a more open attitude toward his characters, letting them exist as fully developed psychological specimens, his deadly irony continues to operate on the level of mise-en-scene."
m/the_martian, Probably the most fun you will ever have watching a bunch of nerds solve math problems.
m/the_mask_you_live_in_2015, Moving documentary examines what it means to be a man.
m/the_masked_saint," You'll be ready to leave long before ""The Masked Saint"" finally goes down for the count."
m/the_master_2011, This is probably PTA's least accessible movie for general audiences. But it is also his most mature work as a filmmaker.
m/the_maze_runner," The dark, concrete corridors of the maze provide the venue for one exciting action sequence, but beyond these superficial thrills, there's little emotional weight to the film."
m/the_meddler_2016," Not enough can be said about the terrific Sarandon, whose Marnie is reportedly based on Scafaria's own widowed mother."
m/the_meg, There's very little to care about between appearances of the title creature.
m/the_memory_thief," Director Gil Kofman's attempt is noble in trying to show this descent into madness, but something rings false."
m/the_mercy, The Mercy is a powerful and compelling story told with care and compassion by a brilliant cast.
m/the_messenger_2015," Over all, the arguments are persuasive, the message from the birds powerful, and the film a rich and satisfying call to action that is presented with some novel ideas for how to restore the ecological balance."
m/the_messengers, May be worth watching simply for the sight of Dylan McDermott playing a downtrodden sunflower farmer who at one point -- so help me -- attempts to punch a crow in the face.
m/the_meyerowitz_stories, It feels lived-in despite its glaringly mannered dialogue and charmingly eccentric characterizations.
m/the_midnight_man_2018," Veterans Englund and Shaye admirably give it their all, but their best efforts are not enough to elevate the subpar material directed in mechanical fashion by Zariwny."
m/the_midwife_2017, A bittersweet delight written to order for two consummate performers who inhabit their diametrically opposed characters with satisfying élan.
m/the_mighty_macs_2011, ...all a bit too nice...but the competition on the court is genuinely fierce and the all around sense of sisterhood is solid.
m/the_mill_and_the_cross, This attempt to explore and dramatize a masterpiece of 16th-century art falls flat.
m/the_minds_eye_2016, Begos' latest feature is an ambitious throwback telekinetic tale that's explosively fun and a solid step forward for him as a visual storyteller.
m/the_miners_hymns," An elegant, elegiac found-footage work from Bill Morrison, best known for his silent-film reverie ""Decasia."""
m/the_miracle_season," Sadly, The Miracle Season lacks the depth of Cohen's 2004 offering. That's almost entirely the result of the film's saccharine first act."
m/the_miseducation_of_cameron_post_2018," The wheels are always turning, but the performance is subtle. It is far and away the best thing [Chloe Grace Moretz has] done."
m/the_missing_picture, It digs into the very soil of the killing fields to give hand-sculpted form to its vanished past.
m/the_mole_agent," Alberdi's film is truly playful, occasionally riffing on James Bond-like subterfuge, but in the end the schtick doesn't get in the way of the impact of the emotions at play."
m/the_moment_2013, Viewers must work as hard as Lee to determine past from present; you may feel amnesiac yourself by film's end.
m/the_monitor," This effective chiller bears more than a passing resemblance to The Baby's Room, Alex de la Iglesia's contribution to the 2006 Spanish TV series Films to Keep You Awake."
m/the_monster_2016," The upcoming ""A Monster Calls"" may have a higher pedigree, but the rougher and rawer ""The Monster"" mines similar emotional ground."
m/the_monuments_men, Clooney has transformed a fascinating true-life tale into an exceedingly dull and dreary caper pic cum art-appreciation seminar - a museum-piece movie about museum people.
m/the_mortal_instruments_city_of_bones, The film version isn't likely to win over many who haven't read the novels.
m/the_most_assassinated_woman_in_the_world," much as the film is more concerned with backstage drama than with the gory scenarios that it so lovingly reconstructs and restages, its own narrative too is best viewed as a convenient platform for capturing all manner of rich background detail"
m/the_most_dangerous_year," It is primarily an informational documentary, not a film with artistic pretensions. But it makes its case effectively."
m/the_most_hated_woman_in_america," Seems to fall right where you'd expect: slightly better than your average TV movie, while not as good as your typical theatrical release."
m/the_motel_life_2013," Recalling characters from a Bukowski novel or Tom Waits song but with less complexity, the brothers are endowed by their creators with little agency, not doing much except lamenting the sorry state of their lives."
m/the_moth_diaries, Disastrously mishandled adaptation of a neo-Gothic novel set in a posh girls' college.
m/the_motive," A good story, but it's resolved in a hurry. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/the_motorcycle_diaries, Should be made mandatory viewing in places low and high.
m/the_mountain_between_us," This is an easy picture to watch... and to root for, in a way, because it's so rarely overbearing. But it's only ever mildly engaging."
m/the_mule_2018," This ripped-from-the-headlines story is practically retrofitted to Clint Eastwood's cinematic sensibilities, yet the delivery feels nothing short of muted and manufactured."
m/the_mummy_2017," ...there are quite a few laughs to be had, some of which are definitely intentional."
m/the_muppets," Mostly, The Muppets is a cry for decency from a couple of guys who have done their part to coarsen the culture - which may be the greatest irony of all."
m/the_murder_of_nicole_brown_simpson, A mendacious and tawdry piece of cut-price tripe that indulges in sub-slasher nastiness while flashing a false badge of progressiveness.
m/the_music_never_stopped," The Music Never Stopped isn't exactly good, but it's definitely better than you fear it is when you reach the halfway mark."
m/the_music_of_silence, A range-constricted slog through the dreariest of showbiz-ascension clichs.
m/the_music_of_strangers_yo_yo_ma_and_the_silk_road_ensemble," Neville is keenly aware of how to show the musicians' kinetic energy onscreen, and he relies on this talent to keep the film consistently alive and moving."
m/the_mustang, Matthias Schoenaerts and a wild stallion try to tame each other in this stirring and poetic prison drama about a man and his horse.
m/the_naked_gun_33_13_the_final_insult_1994, A riotous comedy that -- even with a different director -- manages to remember why the original was so funny.
m/the_naked_gun_from_the_files_of_police_squad," Despite all the outrageous comedy and raunchy bathroom jokes, [the Zuckers] create endearing characters that are likable."
m/the_naked_island, 'The Island/Hadaka no shima' could be depressing were it not for stark poetry of conception and realization by cinematographer Kiyomi Kuroda.
m/the_naked_kiss_1964, Fuller's The Naked Kiss is one of his oddest and most brutal works.
m/the_name_of_the_rose_1986," There are so many good things in The Name of the Rose -- the performances, the reconstruction of the period, the over-all feeling of medieval times -- that if the story had been able to really involve us, there would have been quite a movie here."
m/the_neighbor_2016," The Neighbour is a serviceable B-movie thriller that's in the bizarre position of having nothing whatsoever to offer in terms of originality, performance, visual pleasure or storytelling verve."
m/the_neon_demon," A stultifyingly vapid, ponderously paced allegorical critique of the modeling world whose seethingly jealous inhabitants can't wait to literally chew each other up and spit each other out."
m/the_neverending_story_1984, A shining moment in Science-Fiction Fantasy. Does it get any better?
m/the_new_girlfriend," Sexuality, Francois Ozon's latest film declares, can be as complex as desiring another person can be simple."
m/the_new_radical_2017," Locating the common ground between pro-gun activism and anti-big-bank subversion, The New Radical is as complex as it is discomforting."
m/the_new_romantic," This may be a quick and dirty debut, but there's something ineffably pure about how it portrays someone learning the give-and-take of getting what she wants... a comforting reminder that we're ultimately all just dealing with ourselves."
m/the_newspaperman_the_life_and_times_of_ben_bradlee," A bit overly flattering, but a terrific portrait of a journalistic icon and great homework for this year's Oscar contending drama, ""The Post."""
m/the_nice_guys, Shane Black's 'The Nice Guys' is exactly the movie you wanted it to be.
m/the_night_before_2015," Every once in a while, a studio comedy comes along that makes studio comedy feel easy - the jokes broad and the sentiments sweet without feeling screen tested to death."
m/the_night_clerk_2020," If this thriller lacks much in the way of tension and suspense, if it loses track of the ""crime"" while it tries to flesh out the title character, a fine cast lifts the material and makes it worth your trouble."
m/the_night_comes_for_us," A two-hour parade of button-mashing fight-game mayhem. To the masters of excess before him, Timo Tjahjanto pretty much says ""hold my beer."""
m/the_night_eats_the_world," Even as the story drifts off, Night Eats the World derives its power from a beguiling, provocative implication: It's hard to confront a hostile world, but gathering the courage to do so doesn't make the job any easier."
m/the_night_listener," Running just 81 minutes, it delivers its fascinating little tale with the succinctness and emotional power of a great short story."
m/the_night_sitter," reinvests Yuletide imagery with something more Satanically paranormal, inviting The Evil Dead in for a Christmas snack... like any festive bonbon, might make you feel a little sick, but only because it has such an addictively sweet centre."
m/the_night_watchmen," You've seen blood-sucking vampires, rampaging zombies, and sinister clowns. But have you ever seen these horror archetypes mashed up into one ludicrous yet menacing monster?"
m/the_night_we_never_met," Even if the movie frequently approximates a television sitcom, it never ceases to charm."
m/the_nightingale_2015, There is plenty of heart in this affecting film whose song sings sweetly as it finds its notes on the forest stave
m/the_nightmare, Rodney Ascher's follow-up to 'Room 237' is a unique hybrid of documentary and horror-thriller.
m/the_nine_muses," Engaging and pregnant with ideas, although some of the juxtapositions work better than others."
m/the_nines," Ryan Reynolds may not be a demigod (much less a full-fledged deity), but he plays one to sterling effect in The Nines."
m/the_normal_heart," The Normal Heart manages to work both sides of the issue - the anger at inaction and those complicit in turning a blind eye, and the personal toll the disease took."
m/the_november_man, Brosnan classes up what is basically a watered-down Bond-put-to-pasture thriller.
m/the_number_23," Drained in style, Schumacher's film is a sensless, incoherent psychological thriller burdened with a neat ending that must have been imposed for commercial considerations; this is yet another effort by Jim Carrey to stretch beyond his comedic persona."
m/the_numbers_station," There are some decent shootouts, but the movie's strongest assets are the soulful performances ..."
m/the_nun_2018, There isn't a genuinely frightening or interesting moment here.
m/the_nuns_story," Zinneman, an intelligent if dullish director, has avoided such obvious pitfalls in this adaptation of a factually based best-seller."
m/the_nut_job," With few laughs, barely tolerable characters and over-the-top action, THE NUT JOB clumsily makes the transition from short to feature film."
m/the_nut_job_2_nutty_by_nature," It certainly doesn't compete in Pixar's league, as animation goes -- but it doesn't drop to the depths of those creepy little emoji, either."
m/the_nutcracker_and_the_four_realms," This awkward movie is rarely exciting or funny, and uses a visual assault as compensation for a disjointed, uninteresting plot."
m/the_oath_2018," The film is often hard to take, offering laughs that are rarely cathartic enough to compensate."
m/the_occupant_2020, Writing from the confinement of a global pandemic gives The Occupant a strange atmosphere of unease. [Full Review in Spanish]
m/the_odd_life_of_timothy_green, A fairy tale about parenting that stays kid-friendly without completely glossing over the darker themes of its premise.
m/the_odyssey_2016," Cousteau lived an exciting, if sometimes tortuous life. But, while it's engagingly played by a solid cast, this respectful but hardly revelatory account lacks the narrative potency to recreate it."
m/the_old_man_and_the_gun," ""The Old Man & the Gun"" generally feels like the best kind of tribute, one that understands the material so well that it inhabits its very essence."
m/the_one," The action is fun and ultraviolent, the story is satisfactorily ridiculous and the acting is nonexistent."
m/the_one_i_love," On a moment-to-moment basis, this smoothly made film can be incredibly trying, even annoying, to watch, due to the grueling repetitiveness of the scenes and dialogue and the claustrophobia of the paradoxically beautiful setting."
m/the_ones_below," An exceedingly relatable, primal fears in his debut feature film The Ones Below - playing on the notion of our offspring being in danger, while using a new born's immense fragility as a means of extracting a distinct anxiety out of us."
m/the_only_real_game," As well-intentioned, feel-good humanitarian acts go, ""The Only Real Game"" hits one out of the park for fanatics of America's favorite pastime or good-hearted folk with a little extra scratch in search of a new pet project."
m/the_oogieloves_in_the_big_balloon_adventure, There are no villains in this movie but there's lots of suspense and problem solving involved in retrieving the balloons.
m/the_open_house_2018," Netflix's The Open House is an unimaginative, if inoffensive, horror movie with an astonishingly bad ending."
m/the_oranges_2011," It's the Sundance version of Blame It on Rio, which is to say direly lacking in scenery and nudity."
m/the_order_2003, ... a supernatural thriller that calls into question the very nature of man's relationship with God.
m/the_order_of_myths," Smartly edited, utterly engrossing, and as intelligent an examination of American race relations as I've seen."
m/the_orphanage," There will be moments so tense, you'll need to calm yourself by saying, 'It's only a movie!'"
m/the_osiris_child_science_fiction_volume_one," With all its faults, The Osiris Child is still a solid movie that shows the potential for what can be possible in Australian cinema, just as long as you have the passion, ambition and creativity driving it."
m/the_other_dream_team_2012, I fully expect The Other Dream Team to join Do You Believe in Miracles? and Undefeated in your inspirational-sports-doc rotation.
m/the_other_f_word_2011, It's hard to take this film too seriously when it never seeks corroboration from a couple of other obvious interview sources: their wives and kids.
m/the_other_lamb, The Other Lamb is ... a study in male entitlement and the growing female agency that will break it down.
m/the_other_side_of_heaven, Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis's wall of kitsch hard going.
m/the_other_side_of_the_door, Whilst you're in the midst of its dark embrace it's reliably creepy.
m/the_other_side_of_the_wind," What can be said with certainty is that this version of Wind is perplexing, sometimes exhausting but never less than fascinating."
m/the_other_son, Moving French drama tackles the Israeli-Palestinian conflict via a pair of prodigal sons accidentally switched at birth.
m/the_other_woman_2011, ...a shamelessly manipulative and melodramatic drama that's nevertheless often quite moving...
m/the_other_woman_2014, The director's lack of subtlety extends to the selection of music used on the soundtrack; [like] the theme from Mission: Impossible and that's only one of the blindingly obvious uses of music cues.
m/the_ottoman_lieutenant, More conspicuous than The Ottoman Lieutenant's rote melodrama is the way the film elides the concurrent genocide of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman forces.
m/the_out_of_towners," The Out-of-Towners jogs doggedly on the treadmill of comedy, working up a sweat but not getting much of anywhere."
m/the_outlaw_1943, There are only two reasons why anyone was intrigued with this film...can you guess?
m/the_outpost_2020," A reasonably strong war film, probably the best feature film made to date about the war in Afghanistan (Living Life Fearless)"
m/the_outrageous_sophie_tucker," This gossipy, affectionate movie about the daughter of Jewish Ukranian immigrants' rags-to-riches story and her survival as a star into the mid-1960s is a lot of fun. But it doesn't get under her skin."
m/the_outsider_2014," Given a lot of style, this could have been another ""The Limey""; given even a bit more humor and flashier action sequences, it might have passed for another Statham picture."
m/the_outsider_2018," Dull, flavorless, and fundamentally incurious, ""The Outsider"" is a clueless misfire, the cinematic equivalent of a study-abroad student showing off the kanji forearm tattoo whose meaning he never bothered to learn."
m/the_outsider_2019," 'The Outsider,' at a short 86 minutes, moves at a leisurely pace. It builds suspense and lets us get to know the main protagonists enough to get emotionally involved in their fates."
m/the_overnight_2015," There's a breezy spirit and an agreeable touch of tenderness to the movie that makes it hard not to like, even if it never accumulates much substance."
m/the_overnighters," Less a simplistic indictment of a small-town small-mindedness...than an investigation of the double-edged sword that is unexpected prosperity, The Overnighters raises questions that need to be asked without pretending it knows all the answers."
m/the_overture, the music strikes to the very core just what it means to be human
m/the_owl_and_the_pussycat_1970, Sharp dialogue + Streisand & Siegel make this stage-based comedy worthwhile.
m/the_owners_2020, A clever movie that takes a light grip then holds until you gasp for air.
m/the_pack_2016," ""The Pack"" won't make anyone forget ""Jaws"" - or even ""Cujo."""
m/the_package_2018, THE PACKAGE provides a good dose of hilarity and entertainment.
m/the_pact_2012," The Pact is a good one for a late night, home alone."
m/the_pact_ii," The Pact II plays like a more convoluted version of The Pact - and since I don't care for Nicholas McCarthy's original, I think you can guess how I feel about Hallam and Horvath's sequel."
m/the_painted_bird, A film that is disturbing for all the wrong reasons.
m/the_painter_and_the_thief, A documentary that looks at everyday humanity as a work of art.
m/the_pale_door," THE PALE DOOR is a decent addition to the difficult-to-tackle Horror Western subgenre, but gets weighed down by narrative and pacing issues."
m/the_paperboy_2012," Lee Daniels does not so much direct as distract, grabbing hold of Pete Dexter's splendidly lean and lethal source novel and gorging it on so much junk-food that the plot plays out as a series of cardiac arrests"
m/the_parting_glass, The Parting Glass is an intimate and affecting drama fueled by great acting and sharply-drawn observations of human behavior and familial dynamics.
m/the_parts_you_lose," It's like an abbreviated season of ""Fargo"". Strong performances from Paul McNairey and Winstead; and an amazing performance from Danny Murphy"
m/the_party_2018," A wickedly fast-paced, endearingly transient comedy that, while unashamedly overstated, is grounded by its connections to modern British politics - making it all rather apt for this picture to thrive in its farcicality."
m/the_partys_over_2001," Hoffman's presence as a familiar face gives us a personality to latch onto, that of the man whose support in countless fictional films we relied upon."
m/the_passion_of_anna," The Passion of Anna employs some interesting techniques, such as interviews with each of the four main actors and also sheds some light on many of the baroque mannerisms and symbols that have come to be associated with Bergman."
m/the_patience_stone, The only ferociousness comes from Farahani... She gives The Patience Stone its gravitas.
m/the_patrol," A well executed minor drama that casts a careful life on the inner lives of military personnel, and promises good things to come in terms of the young cast, and Tom Petch's future career."
m/the_patsy_1964," Jerry follows along the comedy lines of Chaplin, but with far less good results."
m/the_pawnbroker, It is our statement that Nazerman is as much Lumet's creation as Steigers: mood and visuals combine with the performance to present a screen creation wholly worthy of Emil Janning's work with Von Sternberg in Blue Angel.
m/the_peanut_butter_falcon," LaBeouf holds the screen with natural allure, making every twinge of his character's self-reproach, and every instant of his dawning joy, achingly felt. His nuanced performance propels this journey."
m/the_peanuts_movie," This adaptation re-creates the TV specials' touching, wistful, gently funny tone. But in the process, ""The Peanuts Movie"" practically cuts-and-pastes much of their signature catch phrases, character quirks and indelible scenes for this new tale."
m/the_people_ive_slept_with," A raunchy romantic comedy that, like its heroine, rarely has both feet on the ground."
m/the_people_vs_george_lucas, Even those who aren't as fanatical should be able to appreciate the enthusiasm and energy people are willing to put into something they love and hate as much as they do George Lucas' 'Star Wars' movies.
m/the_perfect_age_of_rock_n_roll_2011," belongs in the VH1 vault, never to be heard of again."
m/the_perfect_date, I liked The Perfect Date better when it was called Loverboy.
m/the_perfect_family, It's hard not to wish that it had taken a few more chances and explored its certainly relevant themes a little more deeply.
m/the_perfect_guy, David M. Rosenthal's Internet-age thriller falls head over heels for cheesy cliches.
m/the_perfect_match_2016," ""The Perfect Match"" is a romantic comedy by default, and mostly everyone involved is asleep at the wheel."
m/the_perfect_weapon, Better than expected actioner that was supposed to launch Speakman into a big-time movie career; then Street Knight shot that notion down.
m/the_perfection, The Perfection is a genre-subverting erotic thriller that keeps you guessing. It'll have you reducing your fingernails to chewed-up nubs from its gut-wrenching suspense and shocking imagery.
m/the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower," The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" captures the phenomenon of high school with all the tenderness and horror it deserves."
m/the_perverts_guide_to_ideology," Occasionally bonkers but kinda brilliant with it, there's plenty here to thrill cineastes and fanboys alike."
m/the_petrified_forest, Huch of what's on display here evokes a society on the decline.
m/the_phantom_carriage," The double-exposure photography used throughout is a stupefying achievement of its own, an incantation of overlapping worlds and a visualization of the characters' growing awareness of the connection between body and soul."
m/the_phenom_2016," The Phenom, like its protagonist, is hard to pin down, making for a film that's transfixing and opaque in equal measure."
m/the_photograph_2020, Ever met someone who feels more like a soul mate than one who leaves you soulless making your heart sing? Lakeith Stanfield and Issa Rae are THAT couple in The Photograph with well crafted directing and storytelling by Stella Meghie. Black Love Baby!!!
m/the_piano_tuner_of_earthquakes," Stephen and Timothy Quay merge live-action and animation to create a tragic fantasy about a beautiful opera singer, a lovesick piano tuner and the mad scientist with plans for both of them."
m/the_pill_2011," Writer/director J. C. Khoury's debut feature, ""The Pill,"" is the model of independent efficiency. It's a dose worth taking."
m/the_pillow_book," Greenaway's films are rich with style, but style without a good plot can be as bad as plot without style."
m/the_pinochet_case," While Guzmn frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet's crimes a political context, his distance from the material is mostly admirable."
m/the_pirate_fairy_2014," Tom Hiddleston has silver-tongued fun as a young Captain Hook, but the results are as unmemorable as they are innocuous."
m/the_pirates_2014," It's a derivative trove of swashbuckling action, romance, comedy, special effects and revisionist history - the kind of film that would be pitched to studio execs as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" meets ""Free Willy."""
m/the_pirates_band_of_misfits," Congenial and unpretentious, the storytelling could be tangier, but it isn't a bad bet for kids."
m/the_place_beyond_the_pines_2012," The Place Beyond the Pines is ambitious and epic, perhaps to a fault."
m/the_plague_dogs," The animation is better than average but not outstanding, and the script is simplistic."
m/the_plagues_of_breslau," Plagues is a thriller that reveals too much too early and is all the better for it, because it shows a willingness to push the story into relatively uncharted territory in the third act."
m/the_platform," The film is an attractive combination of thriller, science fiction and Gore violence. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/the_playroom," Covers its own ground with tender, sympathetic honesty that is refreshing and invigorating to watch."
m/the_pleasures_of_being_out_of_step," The film moves fluidly between Hentoff's career focus on the Constitution and jazz, his ""two main reasons for being,"" seeing freedom as the key to the beauty of both."
m/the_polka_king," Black does his best to make Jan a vulnerable and sympathetic character, but neither the script nor the direction allows him to become fully dimensional."
m/the_pollinators, Here is a movie that presents an intelligent vision of nature. What's pleasing to the eye is pleasing to the earth - a sentiment the film rigorously supports with science.
m/the_pool," One of the weirdest, most original entries in this year's dramatic competition--American indie set in Goe with Hindu actors--The Pool should divide film critics, but a closer look beneath the surface reveals consistent themes in Smith's growing oeuvre"
m/the_possession," Even if you resist the film's claims of being based on one family's actual experiences, ""The Possession"" is eerily enjoyable pulp."
m/the_possession_experiment," A sum of atrocities, at times a mess, but with good visual effects. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/the_possession_of_hannah_grace," Doesn't do anything with it that you haven't seen before ... or that you won't see again in a few weeks, when the next movie exactly like this one comes out."
m/the_possession_of_michael_king," The Possession of Michael King is nothing new, but it gets the job done."
m/the_post," Steven Spielberg's ""The Post"" is strained and unimpressive Oscar-bait"
m/the_postcard_killings," Morgan brings a determined melancholic intensity to his performance, and his character deserves a better movie."
m/the_power_of_few, The film's tightly scripted hours in New Orleans wield their way to a destination that's worth the time spent getting there.
m/the_predator," While you're watching the movie, it's hard not to get caught up in all the fun. Black and company are having a blast here, and it's infectious."
m/the_president_2016, The President is a striking movie - and a bold and challenging change of directorial pace from Mohsen Makhmalbaf.
m/the_pretty_one_2013," The good twin/bad twin conceit in 2014 doesn't have a shred of the original surprise, and Zoe Kazan doesn't have the chops to carry it off anyway."
m/the_prey_2020," It's not a film that cares too much about making sense of its plot...since the gist of it all is the action, which involves fist fights, spearing, knifing and machine gunning."
m/the_price_2017," Despite all of Seyi's shortcomings, Dara Ju kept me riveted because I recognized myself in him."
m/the_price_of_desire," I came to McGuckian's film knowing nothing about Gray and left feeling frustrated that I hadn't learned more about her, apart from the boorish chauvinists in her life."
m/the_prince_2015, The greatest effort seems to have gone into getting the look of the fight scenes correctly in an otherwise bland film.
m/the_prince_2020," If you would like a movie with really beautifully lit nudity, then this is definitely the movie for you this week."
m/the_prince_and_me, churns suds like an industrial washing machine spiffing up 100 pounds of bland
m/the_princess_and_the_cobbler, An Aladdin rip-off burdened by songs so dreadful that even Academy voters will refuse to nominate them.
m/the_princess_switch, The Princess Switch is sure to check all the boxes for anyone looking for a simple and sweet Christmas romance flick.
m/the_principal," Violent, but still darkly humorous, Christopher Cain's ""The Principal"" takes the old 'new teacher comes to rough high school and takes out the garbage' theme and adds Belushi's renowned sense of wit and likeability."
m/the_prodigy_2019," [McCarthy] a filmmaker who recognizes that the buildup is more fun than the payoff, and he manages to generate suspense with seemingly little happening on the screen."
m/the_professor_2019," This may be the most well-suited role yet for the Depp of today: Perma-sloshed, on a tear to insult everyone around him and particularly enraged by anything he suspects of having a whiff of emasculation."
m/the_professor_and_the_madman, Gibson is fine; it's everything else that doesn't work.
m/the_program, Frears' film doesn't attempt to dig up anything new or profound so much as zip entertainingly round the twists and turns of an episode of recent sporting villainy whose fascination happily survives the retelling.
m/the_promise_2017," Stagnant, contrived, and oh so boring, The Promise is nothing but a perfectly good waste of Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac's towering abilities."
m/the_prophecy_ii, Worth it only for the Walken moments...A comedown from the original
m/the_prophet_2014," A work of essential spiritual enlightenment, elegantly interpreted by nine of the world's leading independent animators, all tied up and wrapped in a family-friendly bow by ""The Lion King"" director Roger Allers."
m/the_pruitt_igoe_myth_an_urban_history, It's a heartbreaking alarm call for a society that desperately needs to learn from its worst mistakes.
m/the_public," The Public is rife with heavy-handed, subtle-as-a-heart-attack type elements designed to perpetuate his agenda..."
m/the_puffy_chair, [A] smart and painfully funny debut feature by filmmaker brothers Jay and Mark Duplass.
m/the_punk_singer_2013," [VIDEO COLUMN] As moving a documentary as you are likely to see in your lifetime Sini Anderson's filmic telling of Kathleen Hanna's story as the voice of Olympia, Washington's groundbreaking punk band Bikini Kill, really packs a punch."
m/the_purge," In the end, 'The Purge' has a plethora of brilliant ideas that are all underdeveloped. And with that comes an insanely unfocused, diluted and generic thriller that carries zero impact."
m/the_purge_anarchy_2014," it finishes strongly, with the best character beats and far-out weird moments, mirroring, perhaps, the way some of us feel in the final moments of pulling an allnighter."
m/the_purge_election_year, Writer-director James DeMonaco's third chapter in the thrill-kill vigilante franchise is the best and pulpiest Purge yet.
m/the_pyramid_2014," If you're looking for cheap scares and have 90 minutes to kill, you could do worse than The Pyramid. But not a lot worse."
m/the_quake," The Quake doesn't break the mold for natural disaster thrillers but, like The Wave, its humanist approach to the genre is refreshing and engaging."
m/the_quarry_2020," Sensitive performances only go so far toward generating sparks in the slow-moving film, which never becomes the crime-and-punishment nailbiter it might've been."
m/the_queen_1968," ""[A] fantastic time capsule from 1968...This documentary is a fascinating piece of history, captured in a style that is very much of-and ahead of-its time."""
m/the_queen_of_spain," Trueba is having so much fun revisiting characters from 1998's ""The Girl of Your Dreams"" that he's forgotten how to build a story out of multiple strands and make it all work."
m/the_queen_of_versailles," Like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our time, infused with the vivid, vulgar spirit of reality TV. It often had the sold-out Eccles Center howling, but also has elements of profound tragedy and allegory."
m/the_quest_of_alain_ducasse," Absorbing and cinematic, ""The Quest of Alain Ducasse"" offers the documentary equivalent of a memorable meal at one of the eponymous chef's three Michelin-starred restaurants."
m/the_quiet," As the incestuous abusive father, Martin Donovan is as creepy and scary as a Monogram-era Bela Lugosi."
m/the_quiet_family," Α film almost nonsensical as it unfolds like a collage of episodes rather than a solid story. However, these episodes are quite entertaining as they combine minor violence with black humor, based on the family's mischievous but naive characters"
m/the_quiet_one_2019," Wyman's not someone we usually hear from [in The Rolling Stones], so his take on the whole 'rock n roll circus' that began in the swinging sixties feels fresh."
m/the_quiet_ones_2013, Jump-heavy scares numb the nerves long before the finale.
m/the_quiet_room, A profound film about the emotional intelligence of little children and the holy calling of parenthood.
m/the_rabbis_cat, The film presents an often sharp commentary on dueling beliefs and idiocies that unfolds in lush pastel hues and distinctively retro drawings.
m/the_rachel_divide, Dolezal is nicely integrated into a larger discussion of modern America's grappling with identity fluidity.
m/the_raid_2," There are tradeoffs with the switch to a more epic, ambitious canvas, but Gareth Evans' action sequel in most ways that count is an even more masterful jolt of high-energy genre filmmaking."
m/the_raid_redemption," It's easy to forget the story altogether in the sheer rush of Rama's fight to the top floor; instead, viewers will wonder how the amazing battle that just ended could possibly be topped. But it is, again and again."
m/the_railway_man," The Railway Man will leave a mark on your soul, not only for the brutal barbarity of war but for the sheer power of screen stories."
m/the_rainbow_experiment," By recounting these stories of the private and public politics, the emotional and the professional, Kallas asks her audience to understand and question how easily we think we can know what happened in any terrible accident."
m/the_rambler_2013, More proof that horror as a genre has been hedged out of midnight movie programming in favor of meandering strangeness.
m/the_rape_of_recy_taylor," An intelligent, incisive documentary that illustrates how events in that small town in 1944 still matter today, The Rape Of Recy Taylor deserves a wide audience."
m/the_raven_2012," [A] flashy hodge-podge of biopic, mystery and gorno."
m/the_real_blonde," A frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface, but there's nothing going on inside."
m/the_real_dirt_on_farmer_john_2007," Ultimately, it is hopeful in its depiction of the creativity that helped Peterson -- who also wrote and speaks the film's somewhat flowery narration -- rebound from the farm crisis that had him over a barrel."
m/the_red_pill_2016," Combines a personal journey narrative with a thorough exploration of the contentious Men's Rights movement, to make for an insightful and at times frustrating viewing experience."
m/the_red_sea_diving_resort," It's like watching a cruise-ship entertainment director make do on a marine humanitarian vessel. Chris Evans will be fine, but he'll certainly have to do better than this Munich-ish cosplay that can't even reckon with the quandaries it poses."
m/the_red_turtle," This is a quiet little masterpiece of images, each one rich with meaning, that collectively speak to a universal process."
m/the_red_violin, A spiritually rich and musically sublime drama about the soulful dimensions of beauty.
m/the_reef_2009," As for suspense, there isn't much. When the only thing at stake is the size of the body count, suspense becomes the first casualty."
m/the_reflecting_skin, Too odd for its own good; too disturbing to dismiss.
m/the_reluctant_fundamentalist_2012," Director Mira Nair chooses to go flabbily macro with the story's riches-to-radicals themes, as opposed to pointedly micro."
m/the_remaining," The Remaining has to qualify as one of the most stirringly adequate, totally acceptable explicitly Christian horror movies ever made."
m/the_remarkable_life_of_john_weld," The key problem with the film is its lacks a thematic focus. While a lot of interesting things happened in Weld's life, there is no larger theme that provides his life with significance."
m/the_rental_2020, Dave Franco delivers a decent directorial debut with The Rental... I just wish it induced more shudders than apathetic nods.
m/the_rescuers_1977, Let it be said up front that a lesser Disney effort is certainly miles above most animated films.
m/the_rest_of_us, The Rest of Us is a quiet tribute to the women who pick up the pieces after a tragedy. Perhaps a little too quiet: hardly memorable at all. Kelly Reichardt without the brooding or menacing undertones.
m/the_resurrection_of_gavin_stone," Just like the character, while definitely flawed, there is a lot to like about 'Gavin Stone' ... it remains to be seen how well it will last beyond a single watch."
m/the_retrieval," Eska provides ample space for his principals to breathe, wisely homing in on the uneasy gaze of the guidance-starved Will, whose struggle will resonate with anyone charged with an unenviable task."
m/the_return," Winner of the Golden Lion at last year's Venice Film Festival, Andrei Zvyagintsev's macho endurance test The Return is an abject lesson in abject parenting."
m/the_return_of_martin_guerre," It's not about whether a man is guilty or innocent, but whether reality is worth holding onto."
m/the_return_of_the_vampire, One of Bela Lugosi's better later day roles since he played Dracula in the 1930s for Universal.
m/the_returned," The Returned is sort of about prejudice and paranoia, but for the most part, the social commentary is as absent as the action, with both taking a back seat to clever conceptualizing."
m/the_revenant_2012, The Revenant is flat-out fantastic horror-comedy that is safely mentioned in the same breath as masterpieces such as Re-Animator.
m/the_revenant_2015," One of the more indulgent and visual experiences I've had at the movies, with glorious landscapes, natural lighting, and picturesque majesty, but the film is more than a demo-reel of mountain ranges."
m/the_revisionaries_2012," Offers a balanced view of the fight over science and U.S. history standards for Texas schools, but lacks the punch it might have achieved with a stronger point of view."
m/the_revival_2018," The often difficult squaring of religious fervor and sexual longing receives poignant, powerful treatment in ""The Revival"" ..."
m/the_rewrite, Hugh Grant is still funny ... when he's allowed to be.
m/the_rhythm_section, There's a lot to admire about The Rhythm Section even if I can't say I fully enjoyed it.
m/the_rider, Beautifully captures the way a handful of people stoically deal with the meager hands life has dealt them.
m/the_right_kind_of_wrong," The Right Kind of Wrong takes every familiar romantic comedy trope and places them into a blender, giving us a story that we already know the ending to, and a main character that we just can't connect with."
m/the_riot_act," While far from perfect, it deserves some attention at least for Sweetser and writer/director Devon Parks, who does much with little and constructs an interesting, sometimes assured narrative."
m/the_riot_club," Conflicting our sympathies serves the work well. Both play and film button-push, but the substantial changes made in the transfer soften the grotesque and muddy the waters."
m/the_rise," Athale has a flair for guy-pal banter; here, the talk is funny and profane, silly and profound, often in the same breath."
m/the_rise_and_rise_of_bitcoin," Whether the crypto-currency in this documentary film is viewed as the inevitable future of e-commerce or a speculative bubble destined to burst, ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"" makes for an enlightening primer."
m/the_rite," The Rite becomes more ludicrous as it goes along, with more than a few lines of dialogue from Michael Petroni's over-the-top screenplay eliciting unintended titters."
m/the_ritual_2017, ...the film moves at a glacial pace and boasts few interludes designed to perk up one's waning interest.
m/the_river_1959, Renoir fashioned what might be his sweetest movie about family and one of the post-war years' most serene cinematic statements.
m/the_road_2012," This low-budget shocker eventually pays off, displaying just enough narrative ingenuity to compensate for a cinematically crude and logistically sketchy deployment of the requisite blood-and-guts mayhem."
m/the_road_to_fame," ...a film that is often interesting, in a multi-culti sort of way, but also contains a lot of loose ends that make it frustrating to watch."
m/the_road_within, ...one of the film's greatest assets is that it doesn't try to beat the viewer over the head with particular messages or go to great lengths to create something maudlin.
m/the_robber_2011," The story is about increasing isolation, and as it progresses it's like watching someone engaged in survival training -- anything extraneous has to go, like emotion, for example, or human interaction."
m/the_rocket," If you aren't moved by the ""The Rocket"" your heart is defective"
m/the_rocky_horror_picture_show_lets_do_the_time_warp_again," The film may have some minor flaws, but you will easily overlook them because if you don't, Laverne Cox is going to set you, well, not ""straight,"" in this case."
m/the_roommate, The suspense isn't suspenseful. The plot twists are transparent. The pacing of the film is rocky. And the movie has the subtlety of a gorilla with a jack-hammer.
m/the_rover," I felt there was a bit of muddle, and the clean lines of conflict and tension had been blurred: the dystopian future setting doesn't add much and hasn't been very rigorously imagined."
m/the_royal_tenenbaums," The witty screenplay, and Anderson's even wittier direction, fuses brilliantly comic dialogue with visual gags."
m/the_ruins, At least the killer plant in Little Shop of Horrors could talk.
m/the_rules_of_the_game," [The film] is a comedy, a tragedy, a portrait of class manners, a love story of touching caprice (who will Nora Grgor's Christine fall for? Whoever woos her at the right moment), and far and away the cinema's greatest midsummer night's dream."
m/the_runaways, A conventionally enjoyable making-and-breaking-of-the-band saga.
m/the_rundown, ... a great action ride that's funnier than most pure comedies.
m/the_runner_1999," ""The Runner"" has difficulty assembling its puzzle of dysfunction, but it's almost worth the price of admission to see Cage give a damn again."
m/the_russian_woodpecker," A corking conspiracy lies at the heart of Chad Gracia's debut documentary, whose darkly comic proceedings are strewn with covert recordings and animated interludes."
m/the_sacrament, There's not much left in the way of tension or surprises and it can't do anything except feel like a huge anticlimax.
m/the_sacrifice_1986," The Sacrifice, famed Russian director Andrei (Solaris) Tarkovsky's last film, is a pondering, intense, obscure film filled with images that will haunt the collective memories of everybody who has seen it."
m/the_salesman_2017, A minor Farhadi still is a Farhadi. That's enough. [Full review in Portuguese.]
m/the_salt_of_the_earth, Quite simply the greatest film every made about the art of photography.
m/the_salvation," Mikkelsen becomes a background player next to Green; he withholds, she combusts."
m/the_samaritan, Surely there were sheepish faces all round in Jackson's camp when they saw this?
m/the_santa_clause_2, Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has more life and cheer in any given shot than the whole of Santa Clause 2.
m/the_sapphires_2012," Its treatment of Big Themes like racism, war and oppression, is shallow to the point of repulsion."
m/the_sasquatch_gang," The Sasquatch Gang may not fully qualify as an undiscovered gem, but it's got some dynamite all its own."
m/the_savage_innocents, Art director and editor have done a standout job in matching and cutting so that it is virtually impossible to decide where Pinewood began and Canada came in.
m/the_scarlet_pimpernel_1935, Robust as an action packed hero tale and love story.
m/the_scheme_2020," A riveting, meticulously detailed guide to a system that seemingly invites rule breaking at every turn."
m/the_school_of_flesh," What goes for dialogue was totally forgettable, or regrettable, or whatever..."
m/the_science_of_sleep," The Science of Sleep is probably not a film for everyone, but in a perfect world where dreamers and artists were celebrated, it would be."
m/the_scorpio_file," The strain of cynicism and paranoia that marked the majority of 70s political thrillers can be found in the effectively dour Scorpio, which feels like a Yankee version of the sort of espionage tales being churned out by John le Carr over in England."
m/the_scribbler," Not much here, as far as paranoid ""Is she nuts?"" thrillers go, but just interesting and kinky enough to warrant a look"
m/the_sea_2013," Despite Ciarn Hinds' best efforts, The Sea is a dull-as-dishwater melodrama."
m/the_sea_of_trees," This will likely struggle to engage the middlebrow cinemagoers who might most appreciate it, especially given its rather gloomy-sounding premise."
m/the_seagull_2018," You can feel the heat, temperature and otherwise, in Michael Mayer's sultry screen adaptation of Anton Chekhov's classic 1896 play."
m/the_seasoning_house_2012," Goes from stark, sober horror to expeditious revenge thriller without missing a beat"
m/the_seasons_in_quincy_four_portraits_of_john_berger," It insists that it's in moments of small talk, between life's larger events, that one finds vitality."
m/the_second_best_exotic_marigold_hotel," This is undemanding, misty-eyed stuff; carried through by its seasoned, thoroughbred performers."
m/the_second_mother," [The film] dissects with both chilling precision and humor such matters as class differences, real mothers vs. caretakers and whether privilege and one's own station are things that can be questioned or changed."
m/the_secret_dare_to_dream," A self help movie importing the key message from Rhonda Byrne's 2006 Best Seller ""The Secret"" in which Katie Holmes and Josh Lucas pull out the emotional beats to speak to the true believers and give them hope in troubled times."
m/the_secret_garden_2020," It's one of the most soothing, comforting, and more importantly, relatable things I've seen in some time. It's like a giant bowl of chicken soup. You know that first sip, when you feel your body relax? I felt like that watching the film."
m/the_secret_life_of_pets," A film that starts off impressively but gradually tires itself out with a loud and loopy caper plot, taking a clever idea to mostly familiar places in the long run."
m/the_secret_life_of_pets_2, The imagination that fuels the series' furry and frisky characters makes it fine entertainment for anyone who ever gazed at a pup or kitten and wondered what the hell they were thinking.
m/the_secret_life_of_walter_mitty_2013, The movie is lost in a Walter Mitty fantasy of its own.
m/the_secret_life_of_words," Polley not only speaks volumes with her wary, hooded eyes and closed body language, she provides the silent emotion anchor the movie badly needs."
m/the_secret_lives_of_dorks_2013," Replete with deadly fart jokes, projectile-vomit jokes, accidental-boob-grab jokes, and various other sources of alleged humor that real-life outcasts wouldn't voluntarily go anywhere near."
m/the_secret_of_the_sword," A Saturday morning kiddie cartoon stretched out to feature length, which by some lights is an awfully long time."
m/the_secret_scripture," Ultimately, this is more the rough outline to a movie than a satisfying picture in and of itself."
m/the_secret_world_of_arrietty, This is sorcery for film-goers. This is screen enchantment.
m/the_selfish_giant_2013, The Selfish Giant is cinema that tells an unsure nation who we are.
m/the_sense_of_an_ending_2017," Its most receptive audiences will almost certainly be older, with enough life experience to recognize the mix of curiosity and regret that ensnares us like so many wild brambles each time we hazard a stroll down Memory Lane."
m/the_sentence, The Sentence is so committed to its concentration on emotion and heart that it's difficult not to get carried away and it feels almost churlish to quibble with the intellectual responses it barely aspires to.
m/the_sentinel_1977, Dead people who throw cat birthday parties. Gotta love it!
m/the_sergeant_1969," The Sergeant comes off as nothing more than a misfired attempt that is supposed to be appreciated for its subject matter, regardless of its ineptitude."
m/the_sessions," The emotional journey is articulated with so much nuance, and such a vigorous belief in human possibility, that everything The Surrogate touches becomes its own, and is made new."
m/the_seven_five," ""The Seven Five"" is cruelly funny, roguishly charming, as cool and crazed and tough as the big bad city itself."
m/the_seventh_dwarf, Musical fairy tale has familiar story but is fine for kids.
m/the_seventh_fire, The betrayal of Native Americans by larger forces looms over this powerful movie without ever being explicitly discussed.
m/the_shack, Most of its running time is taken with mollifying conversations between Mack and the movie's New Age-meets-Bible Belt oversimplifications of the Holy Trinity. It fits right into a long tradition of quasi-mystical pseudo-parables.
m/the_shadow_of_violence, [Rowland] toes the line between optimism and despair throughout so we know happy endings are possible ... for some.
m/the_shallows," The setup is lean, the star is Blake Lively, and for 60 of its 80+ minute runtime the film has some serious teeth, until the final stretch bites off more than it can chew."
m/the_shanghai_gesture," Sternberg was gifted at capturing the feel of an exotic city from a regular sound stage, and he doesn't slouch here."
m/the_shape_of_water_2017," There's enough magic, and extraordinary visual imagination, to smooth the edges of the movie's problems."
m/the_sharks," Unfortunately, Garibaldi finds few shades to Rosina's characterization, exploring neither her broader life nor her sexuality in much depth."
m/the_shed_2019," The social subtext doesn't carry much weight alongside the supernatural nonsense, and it's difficult to find sympathy for these characters who consistently lack common sense."
m/the_shop_on_main_street, suggests the sheer impossibility of ever knowing the Holocaust while simultaneously reassuring us that we can always know individual human beings
m/the_short_game," The film works not just because it makes golf enjoyable to watch, but also because, by the end, you get to know these kids."
m/the_short_history_of_the_long_road," ""The Short History of the Long Road"" doesn't blaze new trails, but it does provide a platform for Carpenter's evolving performance and Simon-Kennedy's skilled eye."
m/the_siege_of_jadotville, The battle scenes alone make this solid and well-paced film worth watching.
m/the_signal_2014," ...a bit like seeing a Nike commercial make a drunken pass at its friend's manga collection while the X-Files DVDs watch from across the room; it may not make much sense, but at least it's never boring."
m/the_silence_2013," ""The Silence"" is more like an intriguing work of misdirection than a great crime film, but it has a dreamlike and disturbing undertow you won't soon forget, and Odar is unquestionably a director to watch."
m/the_silence_2019," THE SILENCE may have lost the race to the screen to make a profound impact with its originality, but there are enough whispers of creative intensity and tender performances sprinkled throughout to give it flight."
m/the_silencing, There is some promise to the setup of the tale ... but Micah Ranum's screenplay would rather play a game...
m/the_silent_war_2019," Although the film stumbles in its second half, its performances and its production don't completely undervalue the film's voice. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/the_similars," In stylistic terms, however, The Similars is fully realized as a semi-camp yet canny homage to vintage suspense templates."
m/the_singing_forest," One has to feel for actors faced with clunky, obvious lines."
m/the_singing_revolution," A wonderful exploration of that still little-understood period, from the mid-1980s through 1991, when the empire of Soviet communism rapidly collapsed."
m/the_single_moms_club," In any other movie, the filmmaker would rightly be accused of trafficking in lazy stereotypes, but lazy stereotypes are the beachhead into which Tyler Perry has firmly planted his flag."
m/the_sisterhood_of_night_2015," An adaptation of a Steven Millhauser short story, Sisterhood drags out to feature length a mystery that's best handled in just a couple pages."
m/the_sisters_brothers," You don't need a deep love of westerns to get a kick out of Jacques Audiard's wry, surprising, and often plain hilarious frontier story."
m/the_sitter_2011," This is a warped, terribly misguided and often incredibly tasteless film."
m/the_skeleton_twins," If Hader has the benefit of slightly more screen time, Wiig is no less impressive as a woman quietly falling completely apart."
m/the_skin_i_live_in," Almodóvar's story-telling is nowhere near as shrill as it once was: as a mature artist, he has refined his skills to a point where these soap-opera tropes assimilate smoothly into a complex whole."
m/the_sleepwalker_2013," A darkly mysterious and extremely accomplished first feature, The Sleepwalker suggests the things we lost in the fire might be much deeper than material possessions..."
m/the_smurfs, Its sole claim to fame may turn out to be as the most slyly foul-mouthed children's film yet made.
m/the_smurfs_2," Beyond a few chuckle-worthy one-liners and some amusing visual comedy, there's not much to engage adults, although the wee ones should be distracted enough."
m/the_snow_queen_2012," The message gets muddled with plot strands going every which way, though the real culprit is some awkward animation."
m/the_snowman_1982," The Snowman gently relates, via expert pantomime and orchestral score, a young lad's overnight adventure with his brought-to-life pal."
m/the_snowman_2017," Jo Nesb's best-selling serial-killer mystery becomes all coal and no carrot, despite a sterling cast and crew."
m/the_snowtown_murders," An incredible piece of cinema and a devastating, poetic work of storytelling, Snowtown is unmissable."
m/the_son_2019," Disturbing in the best sense of the word, though sometimes let down by attention to detail, The Son deserves at the least to be adopted by horror fests."
m/the_son_of_no_one," Performances are strong across the board, and the movie offers a solid sense of place. But the mysteries, once explained, don't make a lot of sense."
m/the_sonata, Perfect viewing for a rainy autumnal afternoon The Sonata is a solid Gothic ghost mystery that will easily entertain.
m/the_song, Writer/director Richard Ramsey's The Song is a cut above most faith-based movies in that it focuses on telling a good story in addition to spreading the good word.
m/the_song_of_names," A fatally old-fashioned and lugubrious historical drama, muting the emotional payoff it labors so hard to deliver."
m/the_song_of_sway_lake, Melodies like this find magic in the familiar. Song Of Sway Lake is a film built around American archetypes.
m/the_sons_of_tennessee_williams_2011," About an early triumph in the struggle for gay rights, and a colorful, fun glimpse at New Orleans' Mardi Gras in drag."
m/the_soul_collector_2020," Holscher opts for a trick twist ending that feels both forced and unwarranted, and the only thing scary about it is that the director thought including it would be a good idea."
m/the_sound_of_music_live," In terms of feeling like this production genuinely delivered, that's one mountain The Sound of Music Live! just couldn't climb."
m/the_sound_of_silence_2019," The directorial debut of Michael Tyburski has a compelling hook as we go on this journey of aural perfection, but the follow-through leaves something to be desired."
m/the_source_family_2013, One of the most detailed looks at the inner workings of an American cult ever assembled.
m/the_source_the_story_of_the_beats_and_the_beat_generation_1999," It is absolutely fascinating to see the real Kerouac here; caught on film, he is every bit as communicative, earthy and irresistibly hunky as one might have dreamt."
m/the_souvenir, The film went on past my interest and continued even when my interest had completely evaporated. And no amount of framing artistry or complex characterization can save a movie once that happens.
m/the_space_between_us," The movie tends to fluctuate between being corny, sappy, and outright ridiculous."
m/the_special_relationship," The relationship between Blair and Clinton never seems capable, dramatically speaking, of bearing the weight the film assigns to it."
m/the_spectacular_now, The Spectacular Now reminds us that even the most familiar set ups and stories can feel refreshing and energized by superb execution.
m/the_spirit," Pushing well past the point of self-parody, Miller has done Will Eisner's pioneering comicstrip no favors by drenching it in the same self-consciously neo-noir monochrome put to much more compelling use in Sin City."
m/the_spirit_of_the_marathon, A symphony of snapping sinews and pumping thighs... Enthusiastically directed by Jon Dunham.
m/the_spongebob_movie_sponge_out_of_water, Its dedication to the transgressive power of frivolity remains the franchise's greatest weapon.
m/the_spy_who_came_in_from_the_cold, Burton's burnt out turn is one of the best of his career.
m/the_spy_who_dumped_me_2018," No matter its shortcomings, The Spy Who Dumped Me leaves you hoping that they'll keep at it."
m/the_square," This Down Under noir confuses incoherent body pileups with ""twists."""
m/the_square_2013," The documentary brings calm insight to an impassioned, still-developing historic event, personalizing the dramatic developments without losing a sense of the greater stakes."
m/the_square_2017, The film's approach could be interesting if it weren't because it tries to tackle too many things in more than two and a half hours of footage without them fit at all. [Full review in Spanish]
m/the_squeeze_2015, Bits of characters and scenes suggest a less cheesy or more breezy movie could have resulted from this.
m/the_standoff_at_sparrow_creek," The dialogue crackles, the characters are well-defined, and the actors smartly cast - especially Dale, whose coiled, crafty vibe is ideally suited to the role of a former police interrogator."
m/the_stanford_prison_experiment," The ugly spectacle of college kids stripping other college kids naked, in a humiliating show of dominance, speaks disturbing volumes."
m/the_star_2017, Sweet Nativity story told from animals' perspective.
m/the_starving_games," 83 minutes of rancorous stereotyping, lame bathroom gags and aimless, often bafflingly outdated film references."
m/the_stolen_2017," ... The Stolen does have the look of a high-class revenge movie, just one that's sadly let down by predictable plotting and overwrought and off-kilter final act."
m/the_stone_roses_made_of_stone," What emerges is a film of missed opportunities, as if Meadows had a backstage pass but squandered it drinking in the beer tent."
m/the_story_of_luke_2012," The outsized nature of their insensitivities is meant to reinforce the pain and humiliation from Luke's perspective, but it makes for a movie with an uneven tone."
m/the_story_of_qiu_ju_1992," This stunningly photographed film is also quite ironic, complete with an O. Henry-style twist at the end - but its reach is universal, as it says something about pride and respect."
m/the_story_of_the_last_chrysanthemums," Throughout his career, Mizoguchi depicted the moral crisis of Japan's subjugation of women; here, he raises it to the most exalted realms of tragedy."
m/the_strange_case_of_angelica_2010," A snapshot of consuming obsession and the inspiring power of art thats like falling into a bewildering, beguiling dream."
m/the_strange_color_of_your_bodys_tears, This blood-spattered pseudo-Freudian nonsense is suitable only for the most avid giallo groupies.
m/the_strange_ones_2018," Despite the game efforts of its lead actors, this indie road-movie drama goes nowhere - slowly."
m/the_strangers," As with last year's lean, mean B movie Vacancy, Bryan Bertino's The Strangers is a white-knuckle thriller in which a couple going through relationship difficulties is terrorized by psychos."
m/the_strangers_prey_at_night," The actions of the family in Prey at Night rarely acknowledge logic, and often seem to be deliberately mocking common sense."
m/the_stray_2017, Cut-rate faith-based tale of a dog that just HAS to be a family's guardian angel makes for grim going.
m/the_substitute_4_failure_is_not_an_option," Everhart is admirably uninhibited about taking her shirt off yet unintentionally disquieting in not only her stunningly wooden elocution, but the dimensions of her cranium"
m/the_sugarland_express," We can see a little of ourselves in Lou Jean and Clovis, and we wish them the best."
m/the_suicide_theory," A darkly humorous rumination about the primacy of fate or free will presented in the form of a twisty thriller with a smidgen of the supernatural,...it's well worth investigating."
m/the_summit_2012," A gripping, cliffhanger document of a deadly trek up the most dangerous mountain on earth where 11 climbers lost their lives."
m/the_sun_is_also_a_star," When you're looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn't seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse."
m/the_sunday_sessions, I'll now own the fact that the most counter-cultural thing in this portrait of a conflicted gay man is his insistence that his religious identity is not some choice that can be jettisoned.
m/the_sunlit_night, I was left truly baffled that anyone with a job thought this was fit to air. What on earth?
m/the_sunset_limited," Grim, but a chance to see two magnificent actors at the peak of their powers."
m/the_sunshine_makers_2017, Terrific story of two men and the revolutionary period they lived in made all the more powerful by their defiance of society's norms as septuagenarians.
m/the_super," Val Kilmer returns to the screen in The Super, a horror-mystery-thriller set in a high-rise New York apartment building."
m/the_surrogate_2020," An indie drama that is almost all talk, and all of it good."
m/the_survivalist_2017," As a calling card movie, it's mightily impressive; dramatically lean, gripping where it needs to be, and a story told with satisfying economy."
m/the_suspect_2013," It's only January, yet perhaps not too soon to call ""The Suspect"" one of the best popcorn movies of the year."
m/the_swan_princess_ii_escape_from_castle_mountain, Charm replaced with cartoon violence in lackluster sequel.
m/the_sweeney, It's a brainless joyride that ends up spinning its wheels in macho clichés.
m/the_swerve, Dean Kapsalis crafts an unnerving sketch of a tired woman and a tired country going off the rails
m/the_swindle_1997," It's a fluffy, good-natured exercise in style that succeeds just fine, but doesn't leave you wanting any more."
m/the_switch_2010," Once you get past a shaky premise, the comedy does blossom in this Jennifer Aniston-Jason Bateman rom-com."
m/the_sword_of_doom, ...there's no real flow or sense of pacing at work here.
m/the_taking_of_deborah_logan_2014, The latest in a long-line of underwhelming found-footage horror flicks...
m/the_taking_of_pelham_one_two_three, Superior exercise in urban paranoia; the superb location work of director Joseph Sargent goes a long way toward tempering the artificialities of the plot.
m/the_taking_of_tiger_mountain, Proves disarmingly entertaining thanks to a Tsui specialty: spectacular fight scenes.
m/the_tale_of_zatoichi_continues," Careful attention is paid to the continuity between stories. Lone Wolf and Cub fans will be happy to see Wakayma Tomisaburo in this installment, looking fifteen years younger and thirty pounds lighter"
m/the_tall_man_2012," A sly, strange and subtly engaging horror story that will no doubt leave several viewers angry, confused, or arguing on twitter."
m/the_taste_of_money, This is a completely unenlightening cri de coeur against the most obvious targets of financial-spiritual discontent.
m/the_tax_collector," All this movie has to say is that David Ayer enjoys creating misery, and sharing it. What a repugnant, hateful piece of work this is."
m/the_tenants," [The Tenants] keeps grimly glued to its one-note premise, relieved by nary a glimmer of humor, surprise or personality."
m/the_tender_trap_1955, A disappointing dated and flat romantic comedy from the 1950s.
m/the_texas_chainsaw_massacre_the_beginning, Why do people climbing into an empty car after being chased around by a psycho killer never check the backseat?
m/the_theatre_bizarre," As with most anthology efforts, only a few of the segments truly shine, yet the production as a whole carries itself confidently and shares a few scattered pleasures."
m/the_theory_of_everything_2014," This is acting out of the My Left Foot handbook, except ... Redmayne rarely deviates from Hawking's whimsical quizzicality. It's a less wrenching, more user-friendly tour de force."
m/the_thief_of_bagdad," Full of astounding effects way ahead of their time, this first screen version of the famous Arabian Nights fable is wonderfully extravagant."
m/the_thieves," A clever take on caper movies, this casino heist has an appealing cast, tricky plotting, and strong, vivid action."
m/the_thing_2011," While it doesn't hold a flamethrower to the 1982 cult classic, The Thing prequel is itself a genuinely frightening and horrific monster movie."
m/the_things_weve_seen," Tre Manchester's The Things We've Seen, mixes elements of thriller, noir and melodrama, which is pretty ambitious for a film with obvious budget constraints."
m/the_third_man," One of the glories of postwar cinema, and quite possibly one of the most sheerly enjoyable movies ever made."
m/the_third_murder," The Third Murder offers the satisfactions of a well-constructed suspense story, with twists that come from the characters of its principals, not plot contrivances."
m/the_thorn_in_the_heart, Watching Thorn is like being helplessly locked out of an inside joke.
m/the_three_caballeros," By far the strangest feature-length movie in the history of the Walt Disney Company, with virtually every new minute bringing something more insanely creative than the last."
m/the_three_musketeers_2011, Anderson's take on Alexandre Dumas' swashbuckling characters winds up being as much fun as putting your privates in a guillotine.
m/the_ticket_2017," ""You see ""tour de force"" thrown around a lot of blurbs, but this is one of those instances where the hype is deserved​. Dan Stevens is amazing.​"""
m/the_tiger_hunter," The period setting provides some fun costumes, hairstyles, and musical cues... the humor comes mainly from the protagonist's interactions with his new friends and the endearing specificity of their situation."
m/the_tillman_story, The Tillman Story mixes talking heads and archival footage into a detective story of escalatingly scandalous proportions.
m/the_time_being," The characters are as leached of tone as the film's chiaroscuro sets and grisaille paintings, although Langella is certainly game ..."
m/the_times_of_harvey_milk, The film convinces you that Harvey Milk was a great individual; the more difficult and more important task is to convince the viewer that Milk's courageous support of minority rights is a great cause.
m/the_tin_drum, Schlndorff's treatment of this material is horribly flawed because he's too interested in making the audience feel comfortable before he starts damning everything.
m/the_titan, Sam Worthington is perhaps the blandest actor alive.
m/the_to_do_list, You may not realize until you're watching The To Do List how refreshing it is just to see this familiar story told from the female perspective.
m/the_toe_tactic, It's originality at the expense of comprehensibility.
m/the_tomorrow_man_2019," A low-key, charming, and perfect reminder that we should all live in the moment and stop worrying so much about our future."
m/the_tortured," a film more suited to the bottom shelf of the DVD rental store, not the multiplex."
m/the_tower_2013," ""The Tower"" may be skillfully executed as an effects-laden opus, but its miniature portraits in courage are ultimately too jerry-built to feel like anything but filler between the combustive set pieces."
m/the_town, Acts so big and tough that it soon grows faintly ludicrous.
m/the_town_that_dreaded_sundown," Regardless of the identical title, ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" isn't some pointless Xerox copy of its '76 predecessor, but a dynamic, atmospherically shot thriller with a perceptive knack for time, place and methodically mounting unease."
m/the_traitor_2020," A handsome production and ambitious in scale, the impact of ""The Traitor"" is muted by the familiarity of its well-worn tropes."
m/the_transporter_refueled," It's going to take more than a new set of hub caps and some fluffy dice to reimagine this franchise, which is clearly up on the blocks."
m/the_traveler_2010," Even by the questionable standards of the straight-to-video arena, The Traveler comes off as an unwatchable and thoroughly aggravating cinematic experience..."
m/the_treasure_2016," The Treasure is no thriller, but there are moments here that inculcate the stakes with prisoner's-dilemma paranoia."
m/the_tree_2010," It leaves me unmoved, although I can see why it appeals to some, with its ethereal touches, its internal workings and its cute children, all wrapped in the melancholy story of a husband and father taken too soon from them in an outback accident."
m/the_tree_of_life_2011," Metaphysical in narrative, ambitious in goal, surreal in style, suerbly acted by Brad Pitt (who should get Oscar nomination), this is Malick's career-summation film, his masterpiece."
m/the_tree_of_wooden_clogs," Using a non-professional cast it demands patience, but stick with it and its warm, gentle humanism, + Olmi's affection for his characters, soon become beguiling."
m/the_trial_of_billy_jack, I defy anyone not to hit the fast-forward button any time a character picks up a guitar
m/the_trials_of_muhammad_ali_2013, An invigorating doc brings the long-forgotten controversy to life.
m/the_tribe_2015," The film's second half descends into increasingly explicit and shocking displays of violence, and, in fact, all of The Tribe is defined by either overheated emotions or extreme actions."
m/the_tribe_2018, You get the impression you're watching a pilot episode of an uneven television series... [Full Review in Spanish]
m/the_tribes_of_palos_verdes," The sibling helmers know the terrain: They're Los Angeles natives with surfing docs to their credit, and they convincingly make a teen girl's awakening inseparable from her mastery of a board."
m/the_trip_2003," The movie's strength is the rapport between the two appealing leads. It's hurt, though, by shifts in structure and tone."
m/the_trip_2011, There's something openly refreshing about Steve Coogan's and Rob Brydon's shoot-from-the-hip bromance comedy. That tart element is the pure Britishness of the whole thing.
m/the_trip_to_greece," It's a modest, simple approach, and one that has remained consistently pleasing for all four movies."
m/the_trip_to_italy_2014," Coogan, Brydon and Winterbottom journey to the Mediterranean in this warmly enjoyable continuation of their improvised cultural and culinary adventures."
m/the_trip_to_spain_2017, The effortless chemistry makes for a supremely pleasant vacation.
m/the_triplets_of_belleville, Forges an all new narrative and visual style that's so winning it lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.
m/the_triumph_of_love," A beguiling trifle, a gauzy, teasing inquiry into the fungibility of emotions."
m/the_trouble_with_angels," The sympathy that the two hours modestly deliver is enough to keep you with a half perpetual smile and leave, in the end, with a pleasant feeling. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/the_trouble_with_bliss," Indie pap, populated by determinedly eccentric characters you don't give a toss about."
m/the_trouble_with_harry," The film, a radical departure for the director, is one of his most forgotten, and it's also one of his best, a night-black portrait of small-town New England nonchalance and charm."
m/the_trouble_with_terkel," Amateurish on many levels and at some point seeming to have been made up on the spot (which would be quite a feat for animation) ... a strong contender for the year's worst film, and not in a fun way."
m/the_trouble_with_the_truth," Shea and Thompson are up against it due to the basic premise alone, so they could be somewhat forgiven for stumbling here or there. But they don't..."
m/the_trust_2016," Throughout Alex and Benjamin Brewer's film, Nicolas Cage holds the screen with his distinct timing and expressive force of being."
m/the_truth_about_emanuel, A tedious wallow in female damage and the indulgence of same ...
m/the_tunnel_2011," [It] might sound like a mundane retread of recent creature features such as Creep or The Descent, but it manages to be something a bit more haunting in practice."
m/the_turin_horse," It's a shame to think of this heroically uncompromising director shutting up shop, but if he does, The Turin Horse is a magnificent farewell."
m/the_turning," While The Turning didn't fully satisfy my cinematic appetite, at least it's bold enough to be different. I'm glad to have seen it."
m/the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_1," The vampire drama of Twilight is all about the romantic agony of eternity, and this franchise feels like it's going on for ever."
m/the_twilight_saga_breaking_dawn_part_2," Directed by Bill Condon, who helmed the last instalment, the film's an adequate end to the story but not much else."
m/the_two_faces_of_january," A pleasurable throwback to the character-driven thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock, rich in atmosphere and immaculately tailored."
m/the_two_jakes, Points out that we may think we're done with the past but it almost never is done with us.
m/the_two_of_us_1967, A heart-warming movie that showcases one of the last performances of the great Michel Simon.
m/the_two_popes, Somehow the filmmakers found lightheartedness and - gasp - laughs in a story of political intrigue at the top of the notoriously buttoned-up Catholic Church.
m/the_ultimate_life_2013, Its thinly veiled message of social conservatism and religious affirmations as the pathway to an ideal life is delivered with all the predigested sentimentality of a Hallmark card.
m/the_ultimate_warrior_1975," This film should have been entertaining, but instead felt tiresome."
m/the_uncondemned," In their eye-opening documentary, directors Nick Louvel and Michele Mitchell reveal how the young, idealistic prosecutors, already overextended, uncovered evidence of the systematic violation, torture, mutilation, and enslavement of women in Taba."
m/the_undefeated_2011," A troop-rallying campaign infomercial as imagined by Michael Bay: hero-worshipping, crescendo-edited at a dizzying pace, thunderously repetitive and its own worst enemy as a two-hour, talking-points briefing."
m/the_unforeseen, The kind of transformative viewing experience that has made the current period a golden age for nonfiction film.
m/the_unicorn," Cleverly crafted, this comedy boldly challenges romantic and sexual stereotypes which makes it a unicorn in and of itself."
m/the_unknown_girl," A run-of-the-mill, plodding drama, the 'social realism' of which never feels particularly real."
m/the_unknown_known," The Unknown Known delivers the type of nuanced, fascinating portrait we've come to expect from Errol Morris, and avoids offering simplistic conclusions about Donald Rumsfeld."
m/the_upside," No matter how heartening the performances are, how hard Hart and Cranston work to make us forget about the transparent blueprint design of the narrative, ultimately, the film makes one feel queasy."
m/the_valet," There is nothing like a Francis Veber comedy to lift the spirits and Veber is at it again, spinning an amusing and uplifting tale about love and duplicity."
m/the_valley_2018," Tackling teen suicide in a film requires a deft touch, but ""The Valley"" approaches the weighty topic with a heavy, sluggish hand."
m/the_valley_of_gwangi," It says something about the production and about Harryhausen's artistry when we realize that Gwangi, the snarling dinosaur created from a tabletop model, is the most realistically alive character on the screen."
m/the_vanished_2020," The Vanished is wildly and weirdly incompetent, featuring one miscalculation after another, after another, and after another."
m/the_vanishing_2019," Even with its all-around noble dramatic intent, particularly from Butler, the film struggles to leave a mark."
m/the_vanishing_of_sidney_hall," For the second Sundance in a row, both [Logan] Lerman and [Kyle] Chandler star in a movie that made me cry."
m/the_vatican_tapes_2015," Mark Neveldine's first solo directorial effort is a silly, shrieky and eminently watchable exorcism thriller."
m/the_vault_2017," ""The Vault"" is a combination heist and horror picture; and it's the rare genre mash-up where each element's equally strong."
m/the_velocipastor_2019," Albeit no cinematic achievement, The VelociPastor is a hysterically ludicrous horror-comedy that knows its absurdity and has no qualms inviting you in."
m/the_very_thought_of_you, Potter marks her ground as one of today's finest leading ladies
m/the_veteran," Clichd, incoherent and queasily Daily Mail-pleasing, its conspiracy theorising third act is a disaster."
m/the_victim_2011," This is the kind of junky, hard-to-watch thriller that apologists claim is part of a long line of tough, grindhouse-style thrillers, but which is actually just amateurish gristle."
m/the_villainess," After making waves with 2012's Confession of Murder, Jung Byung-gil's follow-up delivers some of the most kinetic action sequences ever witnessed in a South Korean film."
m/the_violent_kind_2010, It's one of those movies that belongs in an incinerator rather than a cinema.
m/the_vips_1963, Trying to shoehorn a talent ensemble into a trite premise results in unmitigated failure.
m/the_virginity_hit_2010," It's kind of a low-budget, grungy looking Superbad without the stupid cop stuff."
m/the_visit_2015," When the (non-spoiler alert) trademark Shyamalan twist finally arrives, it doesn't synthesize anything other than the director's devotion to his signature gimmick."
m/the_visitor_1980, Perhaps the most fun you can have in a movie theater without risking permanent brain damage.
m/the_voices," Even with the talking cat, this movie is a lot more realistic than 'Silver Linings Playbook.'"
m/the_void_2017, The Void ultimately descends into a morass of (admittedly pretty impressive) creature and make-up effects and never becomes more than the sum of its dissipated parts and ad-hoc homages.
m/the_vow_2012, A shell of a movie with a paint by numbers script and an unremarkable story.
m/the_wailing, Korean genre maestro Na Hong-jin turns his attention to a nonsensical yet entertaining supernatural thriller.
m/the_wait_2013," By the end, audiences will most likely feel as if they've been locked out of the drama that's presumably unfolding right in front of them."
m/the_waiting_room_2012, This is human drama at its most intense and universal. This is the rare film that can change the way you think and see the world.
m/the_walk_2015," Even when The Walk inspires the eyes, the brain registers little but banality."
m/the_walking_deceased, by the final act neither the jokes nor the plot of the film are working
m/the_wall_2017," Possesses an intensely realized physicality, but tedium outweighs suspense by a very large margin ..."
m/the_wannabe, The film is less a revisionist take on the circumstances of John Gotti's 1992 indictment than a tedious love child of Bonnie and Clyde and Goodfellas.
m/the_war_of_the_worlds, A classic that should be seen by anyone who really likes genre of science fiction in the cinema.
m/the_war_within, The film sidesteps a more illusive and thornier issue - the psychological sense of victimization among Muslims.
m/the_ward," This might not be the epic sort of effort that the Carpenter fans have been waiting for, but it's still a damn good ghost story that knows how to mess with an audience."
m/the_watch_2012," Fortunately, everyone in the cast steps up to the plate and tags the bases convincingly."
m/the_water_diviner, Russell Crowe's first effort as a director provides four movies for the price of one.
m/the_watermelon_woman," [A] sweetly sardonic, pretension-busting look at an African-American lesbian filmmaker negotiating our multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-sexual, multi-multi world."
m/the_wave_2016," It takes the time to sketch an imperiled family worth caring about, but any goodwill is soon weathered by wave after wave of contrivance following the initial town-leveling event."
m/the_wave_2020," Klabin seems to be speaking directly to midnight movie fans, stoners who love hearing about other people's dreams, and Justin Long completists. Outside that particular demographic, this frenetic trip may wind up feeling more like an exhausting slog."
m/the_way_back, An impressive but not especially immersive true story of four POWs who escaped the Siberian Gulags and crossed the Himalayas on foot to freedom.
m/the_way_back_2020," Though the focus is on Jack's journey back to himself through the device of basketball, the best moments in ""The Way Back"" are the basketball itself... The game is what makes ""The Way Back"" hum, not Jack's tragic backstory."
m/the_way_he_looks," Everyone will root for the two teen protags in Daniel Ribeiro's sweet gay coming-of-age debut, The Way He Looks, since the boys are so likable and their route to first love has an undeniably touching quality."
m/the_way_way_back," The Way, Way Back is a funny and wonderfully-told tale about the beginning of one teen's autonomy at a time where everything remains out of his control."
m/the_we_and_the_i," Muddled, muffled and mixing empty comedy with empty dramatics, ""The We and the I"" is an abject failure."
m/the_weather_underground," This terrifically smart and solid piece of filmmaking lets the former Weathermen, now in their 50's and older, speak into the camera and reveal a bit of their personal histories as well as what the peace movement meant to them."
m/the_wedding_guest, a superbly crafted mystery with terrific performances. Winterbottom is a versatile director.
m/the_wedding_party," I don't think it's a film that aims very high and it sort of achieves what it aims to do, I think. I found it perfectly amiable."
m/the_wedding_plan," Rama Burshtein's follow-up to ""Fill the Void"" brings romantic comedy to the Hasidic community, with relatively pleasing results."
m/the_wedding_ringer," It's not great by any means, but it is very entertaining, and as January releases go, it's a borderline gift to get a movie this enjoyable."
m/the_wedding_video_2012, This homegrown romcom is pretty much doomed from the start.
m/the_wedding_year," Robert Luketic... churns out another generically-named, generic rom-com! Lo and behold, The Wedding Year may just be his most generic one yet!"
m/the_week_of," Laughter-free, joke-free and entertainment-free abomination."
m/the_weekend_2018," Notwithstanding any comparisons, there's more assured personality here than there was in her last feature, the bright, proficient but somewhat synthetic big-studio teen romance ""Everything, Everything."""
m/the_well_diggers_daughter, Daniel Auteuil offers a crowd-pleasing remake of a Marcel Pagnol classic.
m/the_whale," Avoids the pat solutions of movies geared to children like ""Free Willy"" but should be seen by them nonetheless since it is a necessary introduction to the problem posed by human encroachment on marine life that can lead to their extinction."
m/the_whisperer_in_darkness_2011, ...provides a good reflection of Lovecraft's obsessions while affording contemporary audiences some good old-fashioned midnight movie fun.
m/the_whistleblower, A fantastic exploration of the struggles of women in a world run by men.
m/the_white_crow," Fiennes' light touch textures this biopic into something exciting, genuine and naturally sexy; it's a film that stays en pointe for its entirety."
m/the_white_haired_witch_of_lunar_kingdom_3d," The themes are dealt with rather hastily, however. The martial arts action also feels a little truncated. But it's the central relationship, the intense, transforming romantic encounter between warrior and witch, that is the least successful element."
m/the_white_helmets," The scenes of the rescuers in their off-hours show the long reach of the war, with the night's spent anxiously watching television news of the bombardment or phoning family and friends to make sure they're alive."
m/the_whole_truth_2016," Marked by the legalese and narrative pivots demanded by the genre, but lacking enough verve to offset its familiarity, Courtney Hunt's film returns a verdict of Not Bad."
m/the_wicker_man_1973," A subtle, effective horror classic featuring an unforgettable finale"
m/the_wicker_man_2006," LaBute does a decent job of translating it to 2006, but the idea behind it just isn't as cool as it once was."
m/the_wife_2018," [Glenn] Close carries the pic, letting her silence speak volumes and then exploding with a righteous rage when she's had enough."
m/the_wild, There's something foul about this latest animated adventure's blatant +h toy-ready construction.
m/the_wild_life, There's more than enough here to keep younger children quiet over a rainy bank holiday weekend.
m/the_wilde_wedding," Amusing and idiosyncratic, but only truly successful when it relinquishes control of the moment to the capable cast."
m/the_wilderness_of_james," Affected and slow, and more concerned with mood than plot, this moony first feature from Michael Johnson uses its Portland, Ore., setting as a canvas for mapping a course from isolation to companionship."
m/the_wildest_dream_conquest_of_everest," Photography puts you in the action as the cameras follow the intrepid climbers, making me really admire both in front of and behind the camera effort. All aspects of this documentary make it a solid, exciting true story."
m/the_willoughbys," The Willoughbys is a mishmash of story ideas strung together by the idea of found family, but it's cute and quirky enough to keep viewers hooked."
m/the_wind_2019," ""The Wind"" doesn't seek to make infallible heroes of its women, but to understand and empathize with even their most unforgivable acts. And it's a hugely promising debut in terms of Tammi's steady, assured directorial craft."
m/the_wind_rises," A melodrama so earnest, rousing and robustly built that you'd swear it could have come out of Hollywood in the 1940s."
m/the_wind_will_carry_us," In nothing else do all of [Kiarostami's] concerns come together in such a satisfying, complete whole."
m/the_winding_stream_2014, The film stands as a reminder of how much it can mean just to listen.
m/the_windmill_2016," Overall, an enjoyable film in an unlikely but imaginative setting. The legends of horror can welcome The Miller with open, bloody arms. He's a great addition to the likes of Jason and Freddy and deserves a sequel."
m/the_winter_guest," The Winter Guest is a pleasure to watch, if only (but not only) for the chance to see Thompson. She is a continually revealing artist."
m/the_wise_kids_2011," Religion may permeate this film, but it does so because it permeates the characters' lives. ""The Wise Kids"" features some nice surprises and some solid acting and editing."
m/the_witch_2016," Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are painfully believable as a God-fearing couple desperately trying to rationalize the inexplicable, and Anya Taylor-Joy is simply stunning as their terrified, all-too-innocent eldest daughter."
m/the_witch_subversion," An often mesmerizing, occasionally kooky but thoroughly entertaining thriller."
m/the_witches," [Huston] dominates the film whenever she's onscreen, pulling out all the stops without ever going over the top. That's no small task, considering her character."
m/the_wizard_of_lies," Given that it offers no new insights on Madoff and underserves its stellar cast, it's hard to see the return on this particular investment."
m/the_wizard_of_oz_1939, This is a completely charming and wholly delightful film in a direction rarely attempted by Hollywood.
m/the_wolf_of_wall_street_2013," The wages of greed and excess portrayed in grand, operatic, often very funny style."
m/the_wolfpack," Not since Grey Gardens has a film invited us into such a strange, barely-functioning home and allowed us to gawk without reservation."
m/the_wolverine_2012," Given the critical spanking that greeted the last Wolverine film, you may be wondering what the steel-clawed superhero is doing back on the big screen. It's a question that isn't answered by James Mangold's X-Men spin-off."
m/the_woman_2011, a ferociously confronting satire of American family values - with real bite.
m/the_woman_in_black_2011, A horror flick stuck in the limbo between cinematic life and death by boredom.
m/the_woman_in_black_2_angel_of_death," The transparent title character from 2012's ""The Woman in Black"" is resurrected in this sequel, which abandons atmosphere for cheap scares."
m/the_woman_in_the_fifth," Engaging and frustrating in equal measure, this is a haunting and frequently disturbing thriller with a superb central performance from Ethan Hawke."
m/the_womens_balcony, Emil Ben-Shimon's The Women's Balcony proves that a movie doesn't have to be mean spirited in order to be funny.
m/the_words, A literary film that stands to work best for those who don't read.
m/the_world_before_her_2012," With extraordinary access, Pahuja illuminates extraordinary conflicts and contradictions facing modern girls in a country even less ready for them than ours."
m/the_world_before_your_feet, Jeremy Workman connects Matt Green's foot journey to the real-time scale of New York City and to the soul of its citizens. This inspired documentary is perfect.
m/the_world_is_yours_2018," The World is Yours is a gleeful romp through one bad situation after another punctuated by a gifted cast, comedic brilliance, and imaginative writing."
m/the_world_made_straight_2015," The performances are strong... and Earle is particularly memorable. The film glows with a dark energy when he's on screen. But it's too long, has a musical soundtrack that's often intrusive, and sometimes sags when it should be taut with tension"
m/the_world_of_apu_1960," The Apu Trilogy, 36 years after its completion, remains one of the screen's great gifts."
m/the_worlds_end, At once a Big Chill-style old-pal reunion story and an Invasion of the Body Snatchers homage doused in beer and bad-boy humor ...
m/the_wrestler, Annihilation and resurrection are the twin axes upon which The Wrestler turns.
m/the_wretched_2020," for a film so preoccupied with watching, the unseen, the overlooked and the erased prove just as essential."
m/the_wrong_missy," The Wrong Missy is a little hit-and-miss, but it's funny and inventive, and Lapkus is good enough to make the word ""zany"" tolerable again."
m/the_year_of_the_yao, A good-spirited and entertaining look at a famous anomaly.
m/the_yellow_birds," The Yellow Birds should have been an exciting, intense war movie, but has instead been turned into Full Metal Jacket for dummies."
m/the_yellow_sea," An epic noir thriller that contains no small amount of excitement, it suggests that Na might well be the best action director currently working in Korea."
m/the_yes_men_are_revolting, The Yes Men Are Revolting eludes serious interaction with these ideas and charges straight for pat reassurance.
m/the_young_girl_and_the_monsoon," A story that isn't as yawn-worthy as it is wholly unconvincing, both as a premise and a recognizable representation of something real and tangible."
m/the_young_girls_of_rochefort, The colors appear faded after thirty-one years but the voices and music come across just fine.
m/the_young_karl_marx," August Diehl excels in the eponymous lead role, as he so often does, complete with an endearing glint in his eyes, as somebody you feel gets a real kick of out a debate, as if waiting, fervently, for somebody to have the courage to disagree with him."
m/the_young_messiah," The Young Messiah is a film of transcendent moments, if not sustained engagement."
m/the_young_philadelphians," Based on a very popular novel, the film is a competent but undistinguished adaptation that breathes only through the presence of its dynamic star."
m/the_young_unknown," The themes of degradation, spiritual hollowness and abandonment are just not conveyed with enough freshness or subtlety to impress."
m/the_zero_theorem, This is certainly a better film than Gilliam's recent outings and for that alone we should rejoice.
m/the_zookeepers_wife_2017," As refreshing as it is to see a woman in an Oskar Schindler-type role get her big-movie due, the trappings of handsome blandness, tinny storytelling, and thumbnail-sketch war terror prove too much for this story of a beauty fighting beastliness."
m/theatre_of_blood, the inherently gruesome comedy rises naturally from the over-the-top scenarios and Price's fantastically campy performance
m/theeb," Nowar, a smart, savvy filmmaker, keeps his focus narrow and the frame alert, eager to drink in not only action but nuances of culture and history."
m/their_finest_2017," Arterton brings grace and understatement to Catrin's gradual belief in herself and in the magic of movies, while Claflin reveals maturity and dry humor that will be a surprise for audiences who know him primarily from his Hunger Games role."
m/thelma_2017," A stylish, distinctively Scandinavian take on familiar horror themes."
m/thelma_and_louise," An exhilarating vehicle for Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, it spins its wheels in a giddy sort of way, then puts the pedal to the mettle, lays rubber and fairly takes wing."
m/them_2007," The directors have thoroughly soaked up the best of its countless predecessors, elevating Ils to highly effective and atmospheric genre entertainment."
m/them_that_follow," Them That Follow could sell itself as a slow-burn drama, but there is no tangible burn to speak of."
m/then_came_you," Then Came You may be simple, and may seem rushed considering the subject matter, but it shows the progression of a great friendship amidst terrible tragedy with such heart and emotion it is hard not to fall for its charms."
m/then_she_found_me," With subtle laughs but solid emotional thrust, it will play very well with older audiences."
m/theory_of_flight," The Theory of Flight is actually fairly enjoyable. [But] when you see Dance Me to My Song, you're struck by the difference. Two movies. Same story. Same objective. Similar characters. Similar situation. One is an entertainment. The other is a thunderbolt."
m/theory_of_obscurity_a_film_about_the_residents," Stuffed with examples of the nose-thumbing spirit that has sustained their popularity despite the bandmates' refusal to reveal their individual identities, the film is a fine primer for the curious."
m/there_be_dragons," A Spanish Civil War story ill-married to a saint's biopic, Roland Joff's muddle is sunk by three unfocused narratives, clunky dialogue, and Wes Bentley."
m/there_was_a_crooked_man, ...a solid little Western that's worth a look if only for its refreshingly cynical sensibilities.
m/there_will_be_blood, [A] work [of] blistering intensity -- and filmmaking that can make your jaw drop.
m/theres_no_business_like_show_business," Corny, loud, splashy, but it has Merman and solid cast"
m/theres_something_about_mary, I don't remember the last time I laughed as hard at a movie.
m/theres_something_in_the_water," Behind the conventional approach, Page and Daniel give their project a political conscience through the people they choose to interview..."
m/therese_desqueyroux_2012," The 1962 version, starring Emmanuelle (Amour) Riva, is superior."
m/these_amazing_shadows, Documentary has more on its mind than just showing off the riches of America's cinematic heritage.
m/these_birds_walk," Those reunions are not always happy ones, but they offer a brief, striking glimpse into the situations that make such a organization necessary."
m/these_final_hours," ""that's not an apocalypse; this is the APOCALYPSE."""
m/these_girls," Skillful, tight editing reveals the volatile patterns of behavior, shifting suddenly from fights to confessions, dancing to despair, yet in the end the girls are always fiercely supportive of each other."
m/thesis, The young director has an exciting way of filming and keeping one engrossed in the story...
m/they_call_it_myanmar_lifting_the_curtain, A compelling portrait of an entire nation being kept in captivity and ignorance.
m/they_came_together," A very fast, often very funny riff on a very tired Hollywood formula."
m/they_died_with_their_boots_on, suffers from being too long and meandering too much into the minutiae of Custer's love life
m/they_live," All the powerful, rich people are from another planet, while the working-class and the sycophantic are humans. Guess it was the only way Carpenter could make sense of the greed of the '80s."
m/they_might_be_giants," Comdia romntica que se torna fascinante graas  sua galeria de personagens insanos, ao desempenho dos protagonistas e  curiosa mensagem sobre a busca da felicidade atravs do no-conformismo s convenes da sociedade."
m/they_remain," With little in the way of plot (the source material is a short story), this sci-fi-tinged horror film is carried solely by the actors and atmosphere, and in the case of the former, it mostly succeeds."
m/they_wait," Initially promising for its attempt to situate Asian supernatural motifs within a North American context, They Wait is itself too derivative of its own movie ancestors to yield fresh scares."
m/they_were_expendable," The most unfortunate thing about John Ford's excellent, elegiac war film, with a strong turn from John Wayne, was its release date, December 1945, since the war was over."
m/they_will_have_to_kill_us_first," Be fair warned: this film will make you want to hug your record collection, and add to it."
m/theyll_love_me_when_im_dead, A fascinating account of an agonizing creative process.
m/theyre_watching," What we have here is a horror movie with all the expected trimmings: Rumors of witchcraft. An isolated house way out in the middle of spooky woods where no one can hear you ... well, you know how that goes."
m/thieves_highway," Thieves' Highway answers the need for something new in film entertainment. It's a hard-hitting, almost nerve-jangling film of skullduggery in the produce market."
m/thin_2006, [The film] makes its case by neither exploiting its subjects nor soft-pedaling their plight.
m/thin_blue_line," Accomplished but detached; you're pulled in, but you couldn't be blamed for resisting."
m/thin_ice_2012," Director Jill Sprecher keeps things moving at a fast and funny pace, with the narrative's sleazy underpinnings well disguised by the Upper Midwestern niceties."
m/thin_line_between_love_and_hate," Once it gets going, A Thin Line is moderately entertaining, but, oh my, that first hour..."
m/thin_man," People like to talk about movies you need to see before you die. Well, this is one of them."
m/thing_about_my_folk, The fact that it provides one with an opportunity to bask in Falk's almost uninterrupted glow for ninety minutes doesn't make it a good movie.
m/thing_called_love," River Phoenix gives a somnambulant impersonation of Christian Slater impersonating Jack Nicholson, and Samantha Mathis spends much of the movie trying to figure out exactly who her character is."
m/things-to-do," Things to Do is a funny, charming, sad and thoughtful film."
m/things_never_said," Veteran TV writer Charles Murray (Third Watch) shows his small-screen roots by overrelying on tense, weighty exchanges to advance the narrative, but Hampton's steely performance makes them pay off, as the poet learns to wrest truth from pain."
m/things_to_come," In the realm of 'prophetic science fiction', it is a genre landmark."
m/things_to_come_2016," Mia Hansen-Love and Isabelle Huppert prove a dream partnership in the director's gorgeous, heart-cradling post-divorce drama."
m/things_we_lost_in_the_fire," Ultimately, the text keeps dragging the gifted actors down to its own borderline banal level."
m/things_you_can_tell_just_by_looking_at_her," Unfortunately, the peaceful pacing turns out to be a bit of a drag by the halfway mark, making the movie seem longer than it actually is, and Garcia's natural lighting isn't always the most flattering."
m/think_like_a_dog, I just didn't think it was funny. If you're going to do a talking dog movie... you really need to go all in.
m/think_like_a_man," When they aren't quoting the book, the actors occasionally have some genuinely amusing interactions. It's a shame their sole purpose is to hawk a book..."
m/think_like_a_man_too," ...a more frantic, less funny reunion pic that proves whatever happens in Vegas will happen in just about every movie set there."
m/third_person," Third Person is a work of staggering trash; an ensemble drama with the aesthetic of an in-flight magazine, but less classy writing."
m/thirteen," An engaging, sympathetic portrait of junior high girls who have grown up too fast and way too little."
m/thirteen-women," Loy is overwhelming in her role, and there are some moments of interesting terror, but ultimately this is implausible and poorly directed."
m/thirteen_conversations_about_one_thing," A theatrical story of ideas, a comical and poignant investigation of what it takes to be happy."
m/thirteen_days, What it lacks in cinematic flair it makes up for in the sincerity of its approach and the remarkable performances of Greenwood and Culp.
m/thirteen_ghosts," While there are intermittent scares and suspense to be had, the seemingly rushed screenplay, overly schmaltzy climax, and too-short running time bogs the final product down."
m/thirty-two-short-films-about-glenn-gould," The films are short, vignettes mostly, but in concert they do more than a conventional two-hour biopic ever could."
m/thirty_seconds_over_tokyo," Mervyn LeRoy's fact-based WWII action-drama was extremely popular due to subject matter, star power (Spencer Tracy), Oscar-winning effects, and intelligent script by Dalton Trumbo, later blacklisted and one of the Hollywood Ten."
m/this_beautiful_fantastic_2017," Like its title, with those synonymous adjectives, Simon Aboud's film strings together a story that strains to be charming while actually being immediately predictable."
m/this_boys_life, a compelling character study that is well worth watching just for Dicaprio's performance
m/this_changes_everything_2015, Klein and husband/director Avi Lewis can't make a rhetorically strong enough case for the central idea... so they fire up the waterworks and hope you'll feel bad enough to let them have their way.
m/this_christmas," That's right, this is a Christmas film that actually constructs a happy ending out of the sight of a naked and oiled black man being whipped for comedic effect."
m/this_divided_state, This Divided State develops into a lively but simpleminded valentine to liberal tolerance.
m/this_girls_life, Ultimately left me feeling very unfulfilled in terms of its plot and its obvious 'message'.
m/this_is_40," A pure, maximalist representation of a gifted artist simultaneously at the top of his game and looking to expand the form."
m/this_is_elvis," The movie's lesson is brutal, sad, and inescapable: Elvis Presley was a man who gave joy to a great many people but felt very little of his own, because he became addicted and stayed addicted until the day it killed him."
m/this_is_england," With its knockout lead perfs and taut if slightly familiar construction, this '80s-set dramedy about a skinhead gang reps Meadows' most fluently made film so far."
m/this_is_martin_bonner_2013, This Is Martin Bonner is undoubtedly a small film but it is finely crafted and holds a big heart.
m/this_is_not_a_film_2011," Panahi depicts his plight with warm, self-deprecating humor..."
m/this_is_not_berlin," A soundtrack of post punk art rock, smashed glass and attitude adds to a thrillingly confrontational sense of time and place."
m/this_is_spinal_tap," It was the first, and it remains one of the best, as Reiner's shots at the big egos, small minds and incredible self-indulgence of overpaid rock stars consistently hit the mark."
m/this_is_the_end," Rogen and Goldberg stunned me with their understanding of the horror genre, the beats, and how to scare the audience. It's an insanely competent horror comedy..."
m/this_is_us," The film's central fivesome prove charming pallbearers throughout the film, which alternates between inspired and insipid as it hits its hagiographic marks."
m/this_is_where_i_leave_you," Everyone here is obnoxious to one degree or another, but enough of it amusing in an appalling sort of way that it's difficult to not be at least partly won over by the brashness of the compulsively uncensored talk and behavior."
m/this_land_is_mine," Jean Renoir's 1943 film has its passionate defenders; the unfortunate thing, though, is that it needs them."
m/this_means_war," Watching really attractive, really charismatic people be really funny seldom gets old, and they're served reasonably well by a tight, disciplined script that capitalises on their game charms."
m/this_must_be_the_place," This Must Be the Place is a bewildering piece of work, a picture that may have initially been guided by a sweet impulse but takes a sharp left turn into crazytown."
m/this_old_cub, A heartfelt tribute to both the player and the man.
m/this_property_is_condemned," Coppola had a hand in the script, but this is an overcooked melodrama that's easy on the eye and not too taxing on the brain."
m/this_revolution_2006," As any revolutionary knows, there's a big leap between theory and practice, and that leap proves too much for tyro helmer Stephen Marshall's This Revolution."
m/this_so_called_disaster," Offers a rare, fly- on-the-wall view of three Hollywood bad boys -- Sean Penn, Nick Nolte and Woody Harrelson -- as they rehearse for a play in San Francisco in the fall of 2000."
m/this_sporting_life, It's impossible not to appreciate the remarkable performances (both Harris and Roberts were nominated for Oscars) or the realistic rugby scenes that earned Harris a broken leg.
m/this_teacher, Herzi commands attention in the central role - her performance offers a similar potency to Helena Howard in Madeline's Madeline - as her character experiences something lurking on the knife-edge between divine revelation and mental breakdown.
m/this_thing_of_ours," Little tension is generated in the resulting internecine squabbles, but there's ample opportunity for the familiar supporting cast ... to wax warm and witty."
m/thoda_pyaar_thoda_magic, Kohli's unsentimental direction results in a magical technically-polished universal crowd-pleaser which can rival any recent Disney fantasy.
m/thomas_and_the_magic_railroad, The complex story is too much to chew for the average preschooler.
m/thomas_crown_affair," It's worth noting that 30 years and dozens of caper films later, the closing twist isn't nearly as startling as it once was, but it still makes for an effective conclusion."
m/thomas_crown_affair_the, If you're gonna remake a classic then this is the way to do it.
m/thor," Kenneth Branagh's Thor may not achieve the level of epic, Shakespearean awesomeness it so dearly covets, but its failings could only be a footnote in the annals of comic-book movie history."
m/thor_ragnarok_2017, Thor and his friends turn the film into a pool party where everything is pure entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]
m/thor_the_dark_world," It feels entirely made by committee - the definition of house style, without a personal stamp in sight."
m/thoroughbreds_2018," Thoroughbred is light on story, and could probably use a little padding out... but it nonetheless impresses with its mordant humor and grim, gliding style."
m/those_magnificent_men_in_their_flying_machines," ...part slapstick, part spectacle, and part adventure, but most of all it's sweet, lighthearted fun."
m/three_and_out," Ostensibly a black comedy, this Brit road movie engages most in its more reflective moments, focusing on characters' feelings of guilt, anger, sadness and regret."
m/three_billboards_outside_ebbing_missouri," With McDormand as the Greek Chorus for the left side of hatred and Rockwell the bumbling bumper sticker for the right side of hatred, it's unfortunate that Harrelson's Sheriff is eventually reduced to a deus ex machina character."
m/three_burials_of_melquiades_estrada," ultimately affirms the value of all humans, privileged and poor, good and evil, all of us -- and that's quite an achievement"
m/three_came_home," The depiction of Japanese soldiers is often harsh, but somewhat nuanced considering the era. At least there are none wearing Coke-bottle glasses and speaking English in a racist patter."
m/three_christs, Three Christs starts out decently and then has a fall from grace
m/three_coins_in_the_fountain," Three Coins in the Fountain is quite clearly a film in which the locale comes first. However, the nonsense of its fable tumbles nicely within the picture frame."
m/three_colors_blue," A complex and fascinating character study of grief, directed with a mesmerizing grace."
m/three_colors_white," Kieslowski, who so keenly satirized the crippling excesses of communism in his earlier work, unflinchingly has a go at training-wheels capitalism, but not without affection for the thawing tundra of his beleaguered mother country."
m/three_days_of_the_condor," Redford, Dunaway, Von Sydow, Cliff Robertson and John Houseman turn in superb work, and the film is as pure a thriller as one could hope for, with a gripping premise, hurtling plot and a marvelous air of menace."
m/three_faces_of_eve," An early, too simplistic Hollywood melodrama about split personality, well acted by Joanne Woodward in an Oscar-winning performance."
m/three_godfathers_1948, Gorgeously photographed Ford version of the often filmed story.
m/three_identical_strangers," This is a strange, ultimately quite distressing story touched by tragedy, told by Wardle with great skill and compassion in a brisk, consistently absorbing package."
m/three_kings, Three Kings is a resourceful and even witty film that irreverently reinvents the war movie.
m/three_men_and_a_baby," Director Leonard Nimoy does not use his ears for comedy -- nor his eyes, even. His three leads recite their lines as though they wanted to take their jumbo-sized salaries and run -- which, given this movie, maybe isn't such a dumb idea."
m/three_night_stand," Three Night Stand's teeth are a tad sharper than those of the standard rom-com, but it will be remembered for its flaws, if at all."
m/three_oclock_high, Even a dumb teen movie such as this has to end with one of those fist fights where every blow sounds like the special effects guys are whacking bicycle seats with Ping-Pong paddles. Is that all life is? The vicious define the terms?
m/three_of_hearts," The screenplay by Adam Greenman and Mitch Glazer understands the old screwball formulas without being tied to them, and the characters are allowed the freedom to develop in unexpected ways."
m/three_sisters_t, Resolute in detailing an appallingly quotidian family.
m/three_smart_girls, Modest film debut for Deanna Durbin has loads of charm.
m/three_strange_loves, Great films are just around the corner for Bergman.
m/three_times," The first section of ""Three Times"" is fabulous; the second is fascinating if remote; and the third a jangly, modernist mess."
m/three_to_tango," An essentially subversive comedy with a bubbly, immensely entertaining face."
m/three_worlds," A little too deliberately balanced in its depiction of its three leads, but it largely makes up the difference with its informed grounding in the economic and social terrain of contemporary France."
m/three_worlds_of_gulliver," For a good number of fans, Bernard Herrmann's fine score is the chief appeal here."
m/threeextremes, An arena rock type film event for lovers of Asian cinema.
m/thriller_2018," If you're looking for an evening of simple satisfying horror then check it out - but think high school rather than college league., as this horror doesn't quite graduate."
m/throne_of_blood," The director's vision of Macbeth as a samurai is still a stunning reading, not merely of Shakespeare, but of history, power and sexual politics."
m/through_a_lens_darkly_black_photographers_and_the_emergence_of_a_people, It's essential info presented with little imagination.
m/throw_momma_from_the_train," ""Throw Momma from the Train"" is a series of missed opportunities and unexploited situations, a movie that wants to have genuine nastiness at its heart but never quite works up the energy or the nerve to be truly heartless."
m/throw_of_the_dice, This silent Indian melodrama offers proof positive that America didn't have the monopoly on epic cinema in the '20s.
m/thumbsucker, Pucci is an actor to watch: He rides this spellbinder without softening the truths that plague the thumbsucker in all of us.
m/thunder_and_the_house_of_magic," No adult will enjoy it all that much, but few will feel the need to bolt for the concessions stand once kids are safely deposited."
m/thunder_road_2018," Driven by Cummings' transfixingly vulnerable performance, the movie not only justifies returning to the source: Shockingly, it does so without even using the device that seemed key to the short's success."
m/thunder_soul, A touching tribute to a teacher who managed to inspire his students not only to do good work but to live good lives.
m/thunderball," While enjoyable, this is probably the most overrated Bond movie."
m/thunderbirds, The puppets still leave more of a lasting impression.
m/thunderbirds_are_go," ...there's no denying that the film could've benefited from an introduction to the saga, as it's almost impossible for neophytes to penetrate..."
m/thunderbolt_and_lightfoot, The Eastwood team has pulled off a modest enjoyable winner.
m/thunderheart, What's most absorbing about Thunderheart is its sense of place and time
m/thunderstruck_2012, An innocuous boys' wish-fulfillment fantasy...that would be more at home on a family-friendly cable channel....But boys of a certain age--and their sports-minded dads--probably won't mind.
m/thursday," A vehemently cynical, abrasive, and intense picture full of stylized gangdom inhabitants, it's at once entertaining, off-putting, and hilarious."
m/thx_1138, Lucas' vision of the future is disturbing. A wonderful first effort.
m/ticked_off_trannies_with_knives," There's a...change in pacing and energy immediately after the attack because the rest of the film...feel[s] like a slog. By the time things pick up again for the startlingly queer climax, Ticked-Off Trannies had already lost too much momentum."
m/tideland, Tideland sees the fanciful helmer overindulging his dark side with a slice of Gothic nastiness.
m/tie_me_up_tie_me_down," A writer-director driven by his passion, Almodovar allows his movies to moan and sweat and writhe. Sex looks like sex, not pornographic but messy and warm. The curtains do not billow, the sheets burn."
m/tiger_and_the_snow," Despite a weaker narrative force in its middle section and without the feeling that we are watching something new, La tigre e la neve still works."
m/tiger_eyes_2012," Remarkably, the story, adapted by Blume with her son, director Lawrence Blume, seems as fresh, painful and poignant as when she wrote it."
m/tiger_orange," Tiger Orange is an exceedingly watchable feature debut. Sweet, funny and enjoyable, this is a pleasant feel-good film."
m/tigerland," All the actors bring their characters to life, especially Colin Farrell as Bozz and Shea Whigham as the maniacal Wilson."
m/tigertail, Alan Yang's feature directing debut is a moving and personal story that clearly comes from the heart. The great Tzi Ma anchors a film about the things of life.
m/tightrope, Eastwood took a chance at the height of his stardom to play a less-than-heroic cop in this gutsy serial-killer thriller.
m/tijuana_jackson_purpose_over_prison," There's a certain sort of wisdom that's espoused by this character... It's really funny, but if you're really paying attention, there's some good nuggets in there, too."
m/tikkun_2016," With startling high-def black-and-white photography by Shai Goldman, the film draws on Dreyer's Ordet and Aronofsky's π in a portrayal of spiritual fallout with horror elements."
m/till_human_voices_wake_us, Something will need to wake you during this rambling and dull supernatural romance.
m/tim_and_erics_billion_dollar_movie," In the race to achieve unadulterated fourth-wall breakage, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie is the new pack leader."
m/timbuktu_2015," It is a tragedy, yes, but a very human one, with an overall caustic, almost nihilistic absurdity running throughout."
m/time_after_time, Writer Nicholas Meyer's 1979 directorial debut is probably still his best film.
m/time_bandits," Director Terry Gilliam's entire career has been spent as an endearing fight against convention. This is his most stalwart example, as the principle cast is comprised of midgets."
m/time_changer, A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness.
m/time_crimes," Even though Vigalondo's obvious direction lingers over every carefully arranged tile in the toppling-domino plot, there's still some sinister amusement in watching them stack and fall."
m/time_for_drunken_horses, Shows how poverty-stricken children are forced at an early age to carry adult responsibilities on their small shoulders.
m/time_for_ilhan, The type of feel-good story we desperately need right now.
m/time_lapse_2015," What was a rather pedestrian ""Twilight Zone"" episode may have inspired this nice little fantasy thriller. That makes it well above average for time travel films."
m/time_of_the_wolf_2004," The lack of any music, humor or dramatic urgency makes the film feel longer than its 113-minute running time."
m/time_out_of_mind_2015, A haunting piece of urban poetry that further confirms Oren Moverman as a socially conscious filmmaker of rare conviction and authority.
m/time_regained," Time Regained does not tell a story, and you will be disappointed if you go looking for one... It is not about memories but memory. Yours, mine, Proust's. Memory makes us human."
m/time_share_2018," Bunuelian in its brash satire of corporate ambition, Time Share can be as blackly comic as a Coen brothers screenplay ..."
m/time_that_remains," The third installment of Suleiman's Palestinian trilogy, which began with Chronicle of Disappearance and continued with Divine Intervention, is the series' most politically poignant, wryly humorous, and visually precise chapter."
m/time_trap," Time Trap is highly creative, populated with relatable characters, with a whip-smart script. Sadly, the very end of the movie undoes the tense atmosphere setup throughout. While it does not ruin the film, it does leave one a bit disappointed."
m/time_travelers_wife," I can only imagine that the scenes of a 40-something man getting chummy with his 6-year-old bride-to-be must have played better in the book. On film, it feels like To Catch a Time-Traveling Predator."
m/timecode, The problem is that the plot is taken from a grade Z porno film and there isn't enough explicit sex to make the thing work.
m/timecop, Those who aren't easily insulted with cliches and disregard for scientific facts might still enjoy it.
m/timeline, Harmless fun with a game cast in the grand tradition of '50s B movies that don't seem to realize how funny their dialogue is.
m/tims_vermeer_2014," The film could even crack the Best Documentary Feature category come Oscar time, because it definitely elicits a response. It's an unassuming work that says that, for all our faults, humanity can achieve wonders."
m/tin_cup," One of the best films of 1996 with its message that in love and in sports, playing it safe can't hold a candle to taking risks and acting from the heart."
m/tingler, Better than average Castle thriller with a wonderfully campy Vincent Price.
m/tinker_bell_and_the_great_fairy_rescue," The animation is crisp, if a touch generic, the voice cast convincing and the story wholesome without cloying too much."
m/tinker_tailor_soldier_spy," An inventive, meaty distillation of Le Carre's 1974 novel, pic turns hero George Smiley's hunt for a mole within Blighty's MI6 into an incisive examination of Cold War ethics, rich in both contempo resonance and elegiac melancholy."
m/tinkerbell_and_the_legend_of_the_neverbeast," Like its predecessors, it's an entertaining adventure that should play well with its young target audience without annoying dragged-along adults."
m/tiny_furniture-2009, Everyone in the film hides behind words-no one more than the director herself.
m/tip_top, An overwrought experiment in cerebral slapstick that misses more targets than it hits.
m/tiptoes," Despite bracingly peculiar premise and astonishingly fine perf from Gary Oldman, pic is an honorable failure."
m/titan_ae, Features classic cartoon storytelling and an all-star cast.
m/titanic," Whatever it's pigeon-holed as, you're going to love the movie."
m/titanica," Given the subject, this documentary is stunningly boring."
m/tmnt_2007, The script feels like it was computer generated. This very mechanical presentation lacks the wonderfully cheesy charm of the three live action films.
m/to_all_the_boys_ive_loved_before," So, as was said recently about another film, leave your brain at the door and lead with your heart. Sometimes you just need to feel good, no matter what your age. This is a good start."
m/to_all_the_boys_ps_i_still_love_you," It takes place in an altogether nice world, and I think I would have really appreciated this movie when I was 12."
m/to_be_takei, But Takei's experience as an underrepresented minority in Hollywood trying to conceal his identity as an even more underrepresented one gives To Be Takei its richest topic.
m/to_catch_a_thief," Alfred Hitchcock's fluffy 1955 exercise in light comedy, minimal mystery, and good-natured eroticism (the fireworks scene is a classic)."
m/to_end_all_wars," An ensemble effort that recalls other great POW movies, Wars boasts many superb performances."
m/to_have_and_have_not," Director Howard Hawks made a bet with Ernest Hemingway that he could make a good movie out of his worst novel. I don't know who won or how much the bet was for, but my money is on Hawks."
m/to_kid_or_not_to_kid," The film wanders a bit in that exploration, lacking a structure that might make it more effective in having the conversation, but there's value in broaching the topic."
m/to_kill_a_mockingbird, Harper Lee's highly regarded first novel has been artfully and delicately translated to the screen.
m/to_rome_with_love," ""With age comes exhaustion,"" according to a rueful line late in the film, and it serves as a fitting diagnosis for Woody Allen's latest fallen souffle set in a European cultural capital."
m/to_save_a_life," Hints at becoming a thoughtful portrait of a teen's spiritual crisis, then abandons all narrative integrity to hit its church-mandated marks."
m/to_sir_with_love," The film has gone in and out of fashion, but it's old enough now to return to it with a clear eye, and see the strength beneath the kooky sentimentality."
m/to_sleep_with_anger," If Killer of Sheep is Burnett's masterpiece, this film, an odd combination of drama, comedy, and irony, well-acted by Danny Glover, is his most accessible picture."
m/to_the_arctic," Imax auteur Greg MacGillivray alternates between intimate wildlife saga and majestic views of the North Pole, offering strong visual compensations for its meandering structure, syrupy tone and excessive sampling of Paul McCartney's back catalog."
m/to_the_bone," To the Bone is narratively risk-adverse, which is a shame since this is a story worth telling."
m/to_the_devil_a_daughter, It's the most over-directed exploitation movie I've seen in a long time -- it attempts to squeeze in so many subplots and parallel bits of action that finally we're left scratching our heads and wondering who the characters are.
m/to_the_stars," By turns pulpy and restrained, with a strong emotional undertow."
m/to_the_wonder, Malick has the unnatural talent to evolve a simplistic and adolescent game of hide and go seek into a profound and existential search into the character's hearts and minds.
m/to_wong_foo_thanks_for_everything_julie_newmar," Improbable as this all sounds, ""Wong Foo"" is a great deal of fun and a small step forward in Hollywood's depiction of homosexuals."
m/toad_road_2013, The first unique horror film to come along in years.
m/toast_2011," The film is agreeable in everything but it's treatment of Helena Bonham Carter's monstrous embodiment of lower-class pettiness, Joan Potter."
m/todays_special," ... Aasif Mandvi has whipped up a delicious film, a heart-warmer sans clichs"
m/todd_glass_act_happy," Todd Glass may have the grizzled experience of one of comedy's distinguished elder statesmen, but he has a young man's energy-firing off strings of rapid-fire jokes, observations and clarifications so fast that we can hardly keep up."
m/together_2001, A frequently hilarious movie that shows Americans from the Woodstock generation that the same daffy lifestyles existed in Sweden as well.
m/tokarev_2014," Nicolas Cage takes ""paycheck movie"" to a whole new level in Rage, a completely worthless, contemptible excuse for a revenge actioner."
m/tokyo_drifter, A 1966 yakuza gangster thriller with a pop-art look by the formidable B-movie director Seijun Suzuki.
m/tokyo_godfathers," A well-told story, forged on vision and delivered with heart."
m/tokyo_gore_police," Propelled by geysers of blood and tidal waves of neuroses, Tokyo Gore Police plumbs wounds both cultural and physical to deliver splatterific social satire."
m/tokyo_sonata, A quizzical dramedy by Kiyoshi Kurosawa that puts some fresh juice into the waning step of the onetime J-horror specialist.
m/tokyo_story," It ennobles the cinema. It says, yes, a movie can help us make small steps against our imperfections."
m/tokyo_tribe_2014," ...the movie runs out of steam long before it arrives at its bloody, action-packed climax..."
m/tolkien," Karukoski's entertaining film boasts flair and narrative ambition, but ultimately fails to completely break free of its traditional biopic frame."
m/tom_and_huck," Long, tirelessly epic tale of TeenBeat cover boys. Little girls scream, critics fall asleep."
m/tom_and_jerry_the_movie," Though slickly animated, this first full-length pic featuring the vintage cat and mouse characters is misconceived from start to finish, full of gooey sentimentality and relegating Tom and Jerry to supporting characters in a banal melodramatic plot."
m/tom_dowd_and_the_language_of_music," It makes a convincing argument that Dowd's personal history is a kind of history of the 20th century itself, encompassing the era's art, science, commerce and politics."
m/tom_jones, Very clever precursor to the British Invasion pictures
m/tom_of_finland," Having taken such pains to establish Tom's Finnish background and its attendant dangers, Karukoski hurtles through the sketchy American section without exploring any of its crucial issues in sufficient depth."
m/tom_segura_disgraceful," The guy knows how to spin a yarn, neatly inhabiting the part of an everyman swept up into situations beyond his control."
m/tomb_raider_2018," Uthaug's approach to the mythical tale is rather heavy-handed with an emphasis on hollow action sequences, making the film appear purposeless."
m/tomboy_2011," Beautifully directed and superbly written, this is an emotionally engaging coming-of-age drama with a terrific central performance from young Zo Hran."
m/tomcats," With all due respect to the SPCA, Tomcats should be put down ASAP."
m/tommaso_2020," Tommaso emerges as a kind of marginal film, made by a filmmaker who seems to be back of many things, including industrial models. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/tommy_boy," This is predictable and very silly stuff, but there are some solid laughs."
m/tommys_honour," Changing golfing traditions may be an unexpectedly hot topic in 2016, but Tommy's Honour offers misty-eyed melodrama rather than any real insight into sporting history."
m/tomorrow_never_dies," You won't miss a thing should you leave well before the end. If more can't be found in Bond than this, I wouldn't object, in principle, to that tuxedo's being hung up in the closet for good."
m/tomorrow_youre_gone," Tomorrow You're Gone may be overly confusing from start to finish, but there's no confusion about the fact that it's simply not very good."
m/tomorrowland_2015," For all its initial narrative intrigue and visual splendor, winds up feeling like a hollow, hucksterish Trojan horse of a movie ..."
m/tone_deaf," For me, I loved the acting, the cinematography, and individual sequences work stunningly. The whole does not equal the sum of its parts."
m/toni_erdmann, That rarest of things: a nearly three-hour-long German-Austrian arthouse comedy-drama that (almost) never drags.
m/tonight_youre_mine," With its breezy atmosphere and killer soundtrack, this hipster romantic comedy should prove a crowdpleaser."
m/tony_n_tinas_wedding_2007," The not-exactly-long-awaited movie version is here, trading in stereotypes just as ineptly as the original."
m/tony_rome," The supporting cast is perhaps more impressive here, most notably a young Gena Rowlands as a trophy wife with a few secrets."
m/too_big_to_fail_2011," Too Big to Fail is a chronicle of recent events... But it fails to transform those events into anything valuable or special, beyond docudramatic re-creation. Ultimately, it's scope is too big, and it fails."
m/too_late_blues," The jumpy, freewheeling Cassavetes style -- for which Darin's jazz, I suppose, is a metaphor -- seems well worth fighting for."
m/toolbox_murders, I suspect one might as well just place the audience in a room and periodically make sudden loud noises.
m/tootsie, The politics of the film seem to be a bit out of whack...
m/top_cat_begins, Another letdown. This prequel of Top Cat doesn't even come close to the spirit and humor of the original cartoon. [Full review in Spanish]
m/top_end_wedding," While a predictably clumsy Australian film with strong visuals and a wobbly script, it is sometimes more poignant than expected."
m/top_five," The mess never coheres, but it sends off you on a high anyway."
m/top_gun," Every time I see it, I just want to smash Tom Cruise's smug, arrogant face into the cockpit windshield."
m/top_hat," A beguiling Rogers-Astaire pairing, if not resolutely their best."
m/topkapi, Stylish lighthearted comical heist drama of stealing a priceless diamond and emerald-studded dagger from Turkey's world-famous Topkapi Museum.
m/topp-twins-untouchable-girls," Leanne Pooley's delightful profile of Lynda and Jools Topp, New Zealand's top comedy duo, entertains while giving biographical background and full disclosure about their lesbian lifestyle. The performance clips are hilarious. Read full review."
m/tora_tora_tora," The characters are merely devices to spout textbook material, facts, and figures."
m/torn_curtain," A strangely muted, dull effort, though still worthy of attention."
m/tortilla_soup, A proud ode to Latino families and their guarded acclimation into American society.
m/tortoise_in_love_2012," It's sharper than your average Britcom, and perfectly charming, so you'll forgive a bit of amateurism and wooden acting."
m/toss_it," The adept Remsen allows the clan's 93-year-old Uncle Claude (funnyman Malachy McCourt, as a kind of lecherous old cross between Charles Coburn and Robert Prosky) plenty of room to steal enough scenes and keep it all suitably watchable."
m/total_eclipse," a noble effort to capture Rimbaud's genius, but it fails to take enough risks to get close to the enigmatic poet."
m/total_recall," Until director Paul Verhoeven allows the violence to reach the berserk level, Arnold Schwarzenegger and a spectacular special-effects team seem on their way to a futuristic classic."
m/total_recall_2012," This movie is a reaction to the original as much as it's a remake, and because of that, I think it manages to carve out its own identity."
m/touch-the-sound, Riedelsheimer succeeds in showing us Glennie's world as she feels it.
m/touch_of_class," A fine romantic comedy with a poignant, unexpected ending."
m/touch_of_zen, a true game-changer in the way it infused the wuxia (martial arts) genre with both epic scale and spiritual intensity
m/touchback," If George Bailey had been a high school football hero, It's a Wonderful Life might have been a little like Touchback."
m/touched_with_fire_2016," Dalio takes us inside, literally shifting the color scheme and the walls of the sets so that we get a sense of how thrilling, liberating, and exhilarating it feels."
m/touching-wild-horses, The insights this independently produced drama has aren't any deeper than those to be gleaned from your average Afterschool Special.
m/touching_the_void," Full of breathtakingly sublime photography, awful dilemmas and cliffhanger suspense."
m/touchy_feely_2013," The twosome and threesome of Shelton's past becomes six individuals, each dealing with an aversion to emotional and physical contact to such an extent that, by the end, it may be hard for the viewer to feel much of anything."
m/tourist, Another painfully dull movie about an American in Europe hoping to capitalize on the looks and fame of its stars.
m/towards_darkness," A convoluted bilingual thriller about a kidnapping in Colombia, Towards Darkness may be too clever for its own good."
m/towelhead," Nothing Is Private is transgressive without being effectively subversive, gutsy to no particular end. It simply lacks style, which counts for so much in this sort of thing."
m/tower_2016," Broadly, filmmaker Keith Maitland's treatment of the UT Tower shooting is both taut and humane."
m/tower_block_2012," An unusual, scuzzy setting for a thriller that delivers with brutal simplicity."
m/tower_heist," [VIDEO] Fast paced and fluffy, ""Tower Heist"" is a spectacle-laced comedy with widespread appeal."
m/towering_inferno, A starry cast share out roles that are less like characters than places in a lifeboat.
m/town_and_country, You really can't believe how bad this movie is until you lay your eyes on it.
m/town_that_dreaded_sundown," Leaves us with such striking moments of stark, raw terror, that it puts many less serious horror films to shame."
m/toxic_avenger," The Toxic Avenger is an incredibly bizarre flick, combining silly jokes with outrageous gore, but it works."
m/toxic_avenger_iv_citizen_toxie," Puerile, gross and pandering to the lowest impulses of teenage boys."
m/toxic_beauty," I was expecting a Supersize Me for makeup, but it's much more sophisticated than that."
m/toy," Clearly, heavy-handed social commentary, cheesy slapstick and kiddie comedy aren't the most compatible of components to shoehorn into one movie."
m/toy_story, The one big negative about Toy Story involves Disney's overcommercialization.
m/toy_story_2, Toy Story 2 is the perfect film to carry the Disney torch into the next century.
m/toy_story_3," Even with the bar raised high, Toy Story 3 enchanted and moved me so deeply I was flabbergasted that a digitally animated comedy about plastic playthings could have this effect."
m/toy_story_4, Toy Story 4  is a film where you'll find your hearts feel warmer and your soul feels stronger. It is glorious.
m/toy_story_of_terror, Horror film-themed TV special is sweet treat for families.
m/toy_story_that_time_forgot," It's still fun, still sweet, and still a pleasure to hear Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wallace Shawn and the gang voice these characters, but I checked my watch several times and would have probably preferred it at something closer to Toy Story Toons length."
m/toys, Beware of any film where the most interesting character is a machine.
m/toys_in_the_attic_2012, Jir Barta's film is a disturbing through-the-looking-glass reflection of traditional fairy tales.
m/tracers, Tracers seems destined to disappear from theaters quickly without leaving much of a trace.
m/tracey_ullman_live_and_exposed," As fun as it is to learn where these characters (and Ms. Ullman) came from, it's sad to see her pack their wigs back into a trunk as ""Live and Exposed"" ends. We can never get enough of the gentle skewering they provide."
m/tracker," It's nothing special, and the pace lags as we admire the scenery, but the best moments have a thoughtful complexity reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart/Anthony Mann westerns, such as The Naked Spur."
m/tracks_1977," The rough, improvised structure suits the inarticulacy which the movie seeks to examine."
m/tracy_morgan_staying_alive," There is a shape to it; with a few video projections and lighting cues, you could call it a theater piece."
m/trade_of_innocents," The film fills up its hour-and-a-half harmlessly enough, but nothing's really memorable. Which is rather, bitterly, ironic."
m/traded, Grim little western about a father trying to rescue his daughter from 19th-century white slavers founders on genre clichés.
m/trading_paint," Nothing about this project seems as though it was made with any sort of care, aside from Travolta's efforts."
m/trading_places, The rise of Valentine and the fall of Winthorpe are a source of great fun.
m/traffic_stop," Traffic Stop's strength, as with all great docs, lies in its capacity to instill empathy in the viewer, placing them in the middle of a situation they'd likely have little occasion to experience in their lives."
m/trafficked_2017," Trafficked ... manages to illustrate the sexual, physical and mental abuse that human traffickers inflict on victims to make them feel less than human."
m/traffik_2018," Traffik is a feature that will probably gets its widest audience on VOD but would be fun to see in a theater. You can just imagine the people screaming ""Kill them!"" en masse."
m/trafic_1972," A masterpiece in its own right -- not only for the sharp picture of the frenetic and gimmick-crazy civilization that worships cars, but also for many remarkable formal qualities."
m/trail_of_the_pink_panther, Trail of the Pink Panther will appeal to slapstick fans of this comedy series.
m/trailer-park-boys-the-big-dirty," A faithful and funny, entirely scripted, feature-length film version of the videotaped and improvised mockumentary series."
m/train_to_busan," When divorced of message-mongering, the film's scare tactics are among the most distinctive that the zombie canon has ever seen."
m/training_day," The film's first half begins promisingly but the second is laughably far-fetched, and the ending is kind of a letdown."
m/trainspotting," [Has] a wild cinematic style that suggests a lust for the new, the different."
m/trainwreck," ""Trainwreck"" allows a new development and angle to Apatow's trademark anxieties through a unique point of view, and is one of his most hilarious and finely-tuned films to date."
m/traitor, Traitor is an amazing flick that perfectly balances out the reality of terrorism and keeps the audience guessing and entertained throughout.
m/tramps_2016," At a time when American romantic comedies aim for broad humor and questionable gender politics, [the film] provides a more intimate contrast to the market standard. If romantic comedies need a savior, Leon may be their best hope."
m/trance_2013, Even the greatest directors can falter. This is just a minor blip in Boyle's remarkable career.
m/trancers, Enjoyable low-budget sci-fi with good performances and a sense of humor.
m/transamerica," Laugh-out-loud funny, tartly off-color and ultimately touching."
m/transcendence_2014, Transcendence strains to create the kind of brainy science-fiction adventure that Christopher Nolan pulled off in the more phantasmagoric and lyrical Inception.
m/transformer," It's a film full of spirit and charm and, by ditching the old simplifications, opens up new narratives to help those who struggle to understand what it is to be trans. We're all human first."
m/transformers_age_of_extinction," Transformers: Age of Extinction has appalling dialogue, deplorable representations of women, un-self-aware action sequences, very little humour and racial stereotyping. In other words, it's a Michael Bay movie."
m/transformers_dark_of_the_moon," Slightly better than No. 2, but still crude and very violent."
m/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen," Fan boys will no doubt love it, but for the uninitiated it's loud, tedious and, at 147 minutes, way too long."
m/transformers_the_last_knight_2017," The film is, of course, aimed squarely at 13-year-old boys, and with that in mind, it fills its purpose."
m/transformers_the_movie, It is as corny as it is magnificent and I have to admit that it is the most fun I've had at the movies all year.
m/transformers_the_the_movie, The Transformers: The Movie has never looked or sounded better (referring to the 30th anniversary edition) and the new bonus features are captivating and amusing. Now if we could just get a similar treatment for G.I. Joe: The Movie...
m/transit_2012," When it goes off-road, it skids out of control, but Negret never takes his foot off the accelerator -- the 84 minutes are over before you know it."
m/transit_2018," A mournful, urgent appraisal of the contemporary European psyche."
m/transpecos," With nail-biting precision, Kwedar has crafted Transpecos into a diamond."
m/transporter, A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness.
m/transporter_2," If I'd wanted to see a videogame in a movie theater, I would have brought my own."
m/transporter_3," In the third chapter, Besson and company neglect all issues of plot (cliche) and characters (routine) and instead tripple the visceral action sequences, placing Jason Statham center-stage while taking full advantage of his physical and erotic appeal."
m/transsiberian," A missionary couple with unresolved marital problems falls prey to corrupt cops and horny heroin smugglers in Transsiberian, a decent thriller that derails only during a preposterous finale."
m/transylmania," It has no artistic or social value, and it contains not one genuine laugh."
m/trap_for_cinderella_2013," Very clearly, this is a women's film devised by men and, for our leading ladies, that's the trap."
m/trapped_in_paradise," Considering that there isn't a single laugh in the whole picture, the term 'comedy' must be used loosely."
m/trash-humpers, Never has the bizarre beauty of degraded low-grade video been exploited to this extent.
m/trash_2015," There's no doubting a certain passion among crew and cast, most notably the trio of native youngsters whose antics provide a solid level of action-packed dramedy."
m/trashed_2012, While there are a few interesting case studies thrown into the mix - the massive swirling island of plastic 'soup' in the Pacific being one - overall there's just not enough material of interest here.
m/trauma_2004," Hampered by narrative incoherence, sluggish pacing and emotionally remote characters."
m/travelers_and_magicians, What salvages the film is the powerful simplicity of its faith.
m/tread," Paul Solet's Tread takes a little while to grab the audience; however, once the stakes are fully understood, it becomes quite intense."
m/treasure_island_2000," No matter how bright many of its ideas may be, however, Treasure Island is far from satisfying, as such matters as narrative coherence and dramatic credibility have been treated as annoyances worthy of being ignored."
m/treasure_of_the_sierra_madre," The movie has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic, frightened, selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him, if he were not so undeserving of pity."
m/treasure_planet," Owes more to the swashbuckling serials of yesteryear cinema than it does to cold, steely science fiction ponderings of the future."
m/treatment," A pleasant breeze that refreshes, mostly because it's a rare, thoughtful comedy clearly intended for grown-ups."
m/treeless_mountain, A work of tremendous poise and poignancy that assumes and articulates the perspective and emotional tenor of its two juvenile protagonists.
m/trembling-before-gd," DuBowski's subject is so compelling that the film doesn't suffer from his traditional approach, which relies on to-the-camera interviews and verite footage of his subjects."
m/tremors," A delightful throwback to such '50s and '60s films as ""Them,"" ""The Deadly Mantis"" and ""Attacks"" of both ""The Giant Leeches"" and ""The Crab Monsters."""
m/tremors_3_back_to_perfection, The third best in the series is still pretty damned entertaining.
m/tremors_a_cold_day_in_hell," The series is officially out of charm, even charm we will it out of love for the original."
m/trespass," A sub-par film that showed the potential for the Brothers Ice to be much better actors than they are musical performers. They make the film almost worth watching. Yes, I said almost."
m/trespass_2011, A home-invasion flick that grabs viewers by the throat and only stops squeezing long enough to wipe sweat from its palms...
m/trespass_against_us_2017, Dynamic storytelling and powerful performances bring out the pathos in an unusual tale of conflicting loyalties set on the criminal edges of a travelling community.
m/trespassers_2019, both Sarah and Estelle are seeking to escape (a key word in the film) their respective domestic situations and to be liberated from a trap of toxic masculinity already inside the premises before the Mexican gangbangers intrude.
m/trevor_noah_afraid_of_the_dark," The South African comic uses comparisons of his home and New York for foundational, scene-building material, but he really shines when he breaks out of that formula and gets a little more political."
m/trial_by_fire," Without flair or fresh insights into its chosen subject, this just seems like spinning more wheels about on oft-discussed subject."
m/trials_of_henry_kissinger, Takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze.
m/trick," Thoroughly entertains in the context of this genre, but it also stands as being the most uplifting and romantic love story of the year."
m/trick_2019, Coupled with the potential victims' unbelievable lack of survivor instincts and Trick quickly becomes a horror movie that cheats on delivering authentic scares and thrills.
m/trick_r_treat, Trick 'r Treat ranks alongside John Carpenter's Halloween as traditional October viewing and I can't imagine a single horror fan that won't fall head over heels in love with it.
m/tricked_2016," As with an unseasoned sausage, the circumstances surrounding how Paul Verhoeven's new ""movie"" was made are, frankly, more intriguing than the final product."
m/trigger_effect, Psychological thriller that shows the selfish and bestial impulses that lie just beneath the surface of our civilized veneer.
m/trigger_man," Pic [has a] marvelous sense of time and space, seemingly empty of purpose yet steadily building tension."
m/triple_9," If you like bleak 'n' brutal thrillers like The French Connection, Se7en and Animal Kingdom (who doesn't?), this is the movie for you."
m/triple_frontier," Star power aside, I'm not really sure why this is one of the few titles Netflix is putting into theatres this year. Maybe it's a contractual thing."
m/triple_threat_2019," As though pumping blood from all the '80s action films audiences loved through an Indo-Chinese POV, Triple Threat's got charm, humor, action, and more heart than you'd expect."
m/trishna_2011," As usual with Winterbottom's work, Trishna evokes its locations vividly; as a story with a tragic arc it's less effective."
m/tristana," Buuel conjures with Freudian imagery, outrageous humor, and a quiet, lyrical camera style to create one of his most complex and complete works, a film that continues to disturb and transfix."
m/tristram_shandy_a_cock_and_bull_story," Really funny stuff, especially if you're into British humor, or appreciate lots of inside jokes about the filmmaking process."
m/triumph_of_the_will, The most famous and infamous propaganda film of all time is revealing for its stern depiction of the way Hitler's Germany sought to present itself to its own countrymen and to the outside world.
m/troll-2, It's rare to find a film with such an ignominious reputation actually living up to the hype.
m/trollhunter," With all of the troll roaring, people chasing, and mythological elements, 'The Troll Hunter' is easily the 'Jurassic Park' of first-person horror."
m/trolls," Kids should adore it, but don't let that scare you - the movie is every 3D psychedelic inch a fairy tale for adults."
m/trolls_world_tour," By the time the rousing finale rolls around, you'll want to 'Just Sing' along with the Trolls. You really can't stop the feeling."
m/tron," while it touts its technological influence, Tron is actually more instructive a model for the special effects extravaganzas that continue to litter the multiplex."
m/tropic_of_cancer, The colors of Henry Miller's worlds coupled with his colorful expressions of desire make the experience a timeless one.
m/tropic_thunder," A smart-alecky sendup of Hollywood in general and action films in particular, Tropic Thunder undeniably provokes quite a few laughs, but of the most hollow kind."
m/trouble_every_day, The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment.
m/trouble_is_my_business_2017," A crunchy, witty, and often just plain funny mash-up of classic noir tropes ... in addition to dialogue worthy of Dashiell Hammett and, occasionally, Mel Brooks..."
m/trouble_the_water, An impressive document of devotion that miraculously stems from still-festering pain.
m/trouble_with_romance," Ever fast-forward through a late-night cable romance just to get to the good parts? This amateurish relationship dramedy features all the stuff you'd skip, and nothing else."
m/trouble_with_the_curve," Eastwood's natural ease and charm as an actor can only help up to a point this conventional, utterly predictable melodrama about a reluctantly aging father and his strong-headed daughter."
m/troublesome_creek_a_midwestern, The underlying lesson is clear: Our state and federal farm policies do not really allow for family farms anymore.
m/troy, Wolfgang Peterson's Troy naturally subscribes to a no-shirt rule for ancient Greece's most prominent heroes.
m/trucker," In his tough-minded commitment to both his characters and to their lower-middle-class milieu, the filmmaker recasts his potentially disastrous material into something that feels emotionally honest, if not exactly revelatory."
m/trudell_2004," More hagiography than history, Heather Rae's long-in-production portrait of Native American activist and poet John Trudell has the uncritically admiring feel of authorized biography."
m/true-adolescents," While True Adolescents may be typical of its genre, it's a solid, well-made entry, with a few details (like its treatment of sexual identity) that help it stand apart from the pack."
m/true_confessions," True Confessions contains scenes that are just about as good as scenes can be. Then why does the movie leave us disoriented and disappointed, and why does the ending fail dismally?"
m/true_grit, Wayne received an Oscar for this enjoyable western and certainly deserved it for being able to reverse his horse quicker and better than lesser mortals do their four wheeled vehicles.
m/true_grit_2010," The versatile Joel and Ethan Coen take a major step toward mainstream (and more conventional) cinema in their enjoyable, well acted remake of the 1969 classic Western, for which John Wayne won an Oscar and Jeff Bridges should get a nomination."
m/true_history_of_the_kelly_gang," Director Justin Kurzel wants to explore the mythmaking around the Australian outlaw, but the storytelling is an utter chore that neither illuminates nor critiques Ned Kelly."
m/true_legend, The film's mano-y-mano battle on a waterfall overhang will leave you gasping for air.
m/true_romance," If you're in the mood for this sort of absurd, violent nonsense ... True Romance does deliver."
m/true_stories," An exuberant and wonderfully oddball stew of deadpan comedy, character drama, music video, and art installation."
m/true_story_2014," ""True Story"" is a tightly made slice of true crime that treads the line between fact and fiction that has so bedeviled storytellers, and asserts that perhaps reality lies somewhere outside of that, and is still only what you make of it."
m/truman_show," A bracingly intelligent, provocative and witty mix of entertainment values and long thoughts."
m/trumbo," What Trumbo lacks for inspiration it makes up for with a high wattage ensemble, zippy dialogue, and unexpected modesty."
m/trumpet_of_the_swan," This adaptation of E.B. White's classic novel doesn't even live up to the Hanna-Barbera Charlotte's Web, let alone 1999's Stuart Little."
m/trust_2010," Chilling, compelling and compassionate - this cautionary tale is so realistic and provocative that it should be 'must' viewing for families with teenagers."
m/trust_machine_the_story_of_blockchain, A digestible intro to a potentially world-changing concept.
m/trust_me_2013," [...] a smart, sardonic, unpredictable morality play that gets the little things right."
m/trust_the_man, ...a cute but thoroughly underwhelming little romantic comedy...
m/truth_2015," ""It's as lack of nuance and objectivity which turns a potentially complex film into a simple, mostly one noted message movie."""
m/truth_about_cats_and_dogs," As much as ""Cats and Dogs"" looks amateurish and sounds uninspiring, the stars make up for it with solid, honest performances that raise the film almost to the level it should have been anyway."
m/truth_about_charlie, [Newton]wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality.
m/truth_about_love, The Worst Film of 2007 awards race has now been called off.
m/truth_or_dare_2011," Robert Heath's horror is riddled with plot holes and atrocious dialogue, but has a couple of brilliantly bananas performances and the odd crunchy jump."
m/tsotsi, Writer-director Hood draws out the story's stark themes with wit and feeling.
m/tu_dors_nicole, ...it's executed with such charm and skill in every gorgeous frame that I walked out completely and totally smitten.
m/tuck_everlasting," Even at 90 minutes, the tottering Tuck sure feels everlasting."
m/tucked, It's remarkable that the film maintains a sense of cheeky optimism even in the story's intensely moving darker moments.
m/tucker_and_dale_vs_evil, There's nothing wrong with a one-joke horror/comedy -- provided you keep the joke spinning for 90 minutes. This flick (somehow) does.
m/tucker_the_man_and_his_dream, Bridges' riviting performance should keep the rest of you glued to your set and longing for one of his rocketship cars.
m/tuesday_after_christmas, More about well-observed moments of everyday life than it is about heightened melodrama.
m/tulip_fever, One you'll want to expunge from your mind as quickly as possible.
m/tully," The believable young people growing on this plot of soil are never predictable; neither are the unmannered, affecting performances."
m/tully_2018, Marlo is an incredibly complex character and Theron has no problem emerging herself into this role.
m/tumbledown_2016," ""Tumbledown"" sees its good intentions undermined by cloying sitcom conventions."
m/tunes_of_glory," Mills e Guinness protagonizam um belo duelo de interpretações, mas o filme se prejudica um pouco em seu terceiro ato, já que a resolução parece melodramática e artificial."
m/turbo_2013," A hilarious, high-octane variation of Aesop's fable about The Tortoise and the Hare!"
m/turbo_a_power_rangers_movie, It's cheesy-looking and convoluted and has as much character as a bus tire.
m/turistas, Turistas has better production values than most Hollywood pretty-people-in-peril movies. But even beautiful scenery can't gussy up this flat film.
m/turkey_shoot_2014, The action sequences are poorly rendered and its satirical edge is blunted by its borrowings from sharper films such as Rollerball and Starship Troopers.
m/turn_it_up," It's a formulaic street-crime thriller with a message, and if Turn It Up doesn't bring much new to the genre, it serves it reliably."
m/turn_the_river," Turn the River lacks almost everything Eigeman has as a performer: charisma, wit and snappy delivery."
m/turner_and_hooch," Hanks, who can even grace a film such as ""The 'Burbs,"" is always a movie's best friend."
m/turning-green, suffers from a strangely lazy narrative and a bizarre waste of notable actors
m/turtle_the_incredible_journey, Anthropomorphizes its shelled protagonist in a manner so melodramatic as to make one cringe.
m/tuscaloosa," Harder tries very hard to pack a lot of material and topicality into Tuscaloosa. While he doesn't always succeed in creating a seamless story, at least it's better than the similarly themed American Pastoral."
m/tusk_2014," ""Tusk"" combines autobiographical elements, spooky late-night B-movie influences and a deeper thematic exploration of the nature of storytelling, to create something wholly unique and twisted."
m/tuxedo, Chan's great charisma drives the movie and made me overlook many of its weaker moments.
m/tuyas_marriage_2006," Tuya's Marriage can feel a tad overwritten, but in terms of its cultural and emotional portraits, the film's neo-realist authenticity is nonetheless striking."
m/tv_set," Wavering between dark humor and the anguish of the creative soul, this look at the self-destructive TV industry never quite gets at either."
m/twelfth_night_1998, Nunn has done a very good job of keeping the humor and vitality of Shakespeare intact...
m/twelve," Expansively, dramatically, magnificently Russian, Nikita Mikhalkov's loose remake of 12 Angry Men plays like vintage jazz from a veteran band."
m/twelve-2008," Joel Schumacher returns to the teen movie arena for the first time since The Lost Boys with Twelve, a ludicrous melodrama that makes his 1987 slice of vampire cheese look like high art."
m/twelve_and_holding, encapsulates everything one could hope for from a sophomore effort
m/twelve_thirty," Despite a few moments of surprising insight, Twelve Thirty comes off as more mechanistic than organic; it's composed rather than truly lived."
m/twentieth_century, There really aren't all that many chances to go to the movies and have this much fun.
m/twentyfourseven," Certainly worth seeing for its understated portrait of working-class alienation and for the enthusiasm and soul Hoskins brings to his goodhearted, hopeful character."
m/twentynine_palms, This is one of those films in which the Act of Driving becomes a 10-minute statement of high emptiness.
m/twice_born, Penelope Cruz and Emile Hirsch play ill-matched - in every sense - lovers in Sergio Castellitto's misguided romantic melodrama.
m/twice_in_a_lifetime, At times so personal that the act of watching the movie often feels like eavesdropping.
m/twice_told_tales, Twice-Told Tales manages to retain a great deal of the literate feel of Hawthorne's work.
m/twilight," Low-key is not the adjective you'd expect to describe a highly anticipated vampire movie, but there it is."
m/twilight_saga_new_moon," This is a film for the fans. Fans of the books. Fans of the first film. If you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this. If you didn't, you have no chance here. It's a New Moon, not a new dawn."
m/twilight_zone_the_movie," TV show is much better; some mature themes, violence."
m/twin-dragons, It's hard to imagine why it took two reputable directors to put together this dopey affair!
m/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me, Fans of the dark comedy will find little to laugh about -- unless it is Lynch's pretentiousness -- in this horrific look at Laura's last seven days.
m/twin_murders_the_silence_of_the_white_city," It's more stylish and provocative than Women of the Night, but be forewarned that the murders at the heart of the story are depicted in disturbing detail."
m/twist_of_faith," The film is difficult to watch but illuminating as a piece of hard, spare journalism."
m/twisted, The only way you could stuff one more movie cop cliché into Twisted would be with a shoehorn and a sledgehammer.
m/twitches, There's sort of... cheesy TV level magic but it worked.
m/twixt," Not really scary, although there are some nice creepy visuals here and there."
m/two-bits," It obviously has its moments, but most of the way this is pretty tepid stuff. We've seen it all before."
m/two_brothers," Returning to the territory of his 1989 hit The Bear, Jean-Jacques Annaud delivers another refreshingly mature fable of bestial devotion."
m/two_can_play_that_game," That's all this movie is, a string of would-be jokes that are hammered home by nonstop narration that shouldn't be necessary."
m/two_days_one_night," Specialists in unvarnished intimacy, the Dardenne brothers add another clear-eyed contemplation of stark social reality to their impressive output."
m/two_evil_eyes," You can't go too wrong with these directors. Maybe just a little bit wrong, but it's still good."
m/two_family_house," For once, an American urban movie skips the flag-waving etiquette of ethnic reconciliation."
m/two_for_the_money," ...a decent yarn, but we've seen it all before and done much better and more interesting at that. In other words, been there...done that."
m/two_for_the_road," Despite its visual trickery, it's one of the most emotionally honest films ever made in America."
m/two_girls_and_a_guy," Robert Downey Jr. is an extraordinarily gifted actor and, despite a contrived storyline and shaky dialogue, Two Girls and a Guy is a striking film, thanks primarily to his inspired performance."
m/two_heads_creek," Two Heads Creek is a splatter filled satire on Australia's dark side with plenty of blood, guts and brains, of both the literal and figurative variety."
m/two_if_by_sea, Sandra Bullock in a crappy romance is expected. Denis Leary starring in one is scary.
m/two_lives," For an issue movie ""Two Lives"" is something of a nail-biter."
m/two_lovers, A throwback to the days when love in the movies involved the mind as well as the heart.
m/two_men_in_town_2015," What seems meant as a scorching indictment of American injustice and prejudice, or perhaps the searing character study of a cornered man, just ends up looking wishy-washy and old-fashioned."
m/two_men_went_to_war," In the end, the picture comes up sufficiently short on both the wit and action fronts to be declared a keeper."
m/two_mules_for_sister_sara," It shows in a one-joke situation that rapidly wears thin, in tension that doesn't hold up, in acting that is never up to snuff."
m/two_night_stand," Charming but contrived, more slapdash than sexy and more interested in late-act reversals than real-life relationships, ""Two Night Stand"" isn't really going to scratch anyone's itchy spots, no matter how far it's willing to go in trying to do so."
m/two_on_a_guillotine_1965, Hangs a neon sign around the key set-up points and lights off fireworks around them so that it's easy to see exactly what the big reveals will be.
m/two_weeks," An ineffective would-be tear-jerker that proves the adage 'dying is easy, comedy is hard.'"
m/two_weeks_in_another_town, The film borders on soap opera but manages to get beyond it because of Minnelli' skills as a director and the fine acting from the two male leads.
m/two_weeks_notice, The picture hobbles along using the considerable charisma of its stars as a crutch. But we've all seen Grant's bewildered byronisms & Bullock's cute-'n-clumsy routine before.
m/two_women," A powerful experience to behold, and one of De Sica's finest films."
m/tycoon_a_new_russian," Though billed as a Russian 'Godfather,' this convoluted story could be mighty confusing."
m/tying_the_knot_2004," Exhibits an accomplished maturity from the first-time director, deftly applying a dry wit, a healthy sense of irony, and a nonexploitive approach to emotionality."
m/tyler_perrys_a_fall_from_grace," Lousy as the movie is, you can't help but admire its entertainment value."
m/tyler_perrys_a_madea_christmas_2013," With a character who can essentially say and do whatever she wants, you might expect a bit more."
m/tyler_perrys_a_madea_family_funeral," The (often improvised) scenes involving Perry's elderly trio give the film genuine comic spark and energy. But when we're left with the grieving family and their sexual secrets, the movie has the dramatic and visual flatness of a TV soap opera."
m/tyler_perrys_acrimony," A film that's absolutely dreadful from start to finish, and makes the worst soap opera you can imagine look Oscar-worthy in comparison. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, Nudity, etc. - also Available)"
m/tyler_perrys_boo_2_a_madea_halloween," As a pure Perry apologist, this critic found Boo 2! boring, frankly."
m/tyler_perrys_boo_a_madea_halloween," This comedy is unlikely to win over any new fans, but the devoted will find comfort in the familiarity."
m/tyler_perrys_good_deeds," There aren't a lot of laughs in ""Good Deeds,"" and it could have used more of them."
m/tyrannosaur," Brit thesp Paddy Considine makes a strong writing-helming feature debut with ""Tyrannosaur,"" recycling the same cast, characters and setup he used for his 2008 award-winning short ""Dog Altogether."""
m/tyrel, A film with a very off-the-cuff energy designed to make people uneasy but that doesn't amount to nearly enough in the end.
m/u2_rattle_and_hum," R&H exists as it does simply because U2 had “planned” too much ahead of time, the antithesis of spontaneity and the killjoy of documentary filmmaking."
m/u571, U-571 leaves no soggy submarine story cliche unturned.
m/u_turn_1997," If you want to see U TURN precisely for Stone's individual stamp on the work, you probably won't be disappointed"
m/ugetsu," Densely plotted but as emotionally subtle as its name, Ugetsu is one of the great experiences of cinema."
m/ugly_truth, It's just more of the same formulaic relationship poppycock that needs to have its mouth washed out with soap.
m/uglydolls," Sure, it's technically for kids, but a movie this good is for everyone."
m/uhf," This is the dreariest comedy in many a month, a depressing slog through recycled comic formulas."
m/ulees_gold, The attentive way Nunez films his entire cast is as resourceful and evocative as the way he films his locations...
m/ultimate_gift, The ultimate gift to the bored audience comes when the end credits signify salvation.
m/ulzanas_raid, The kind of storyline that suits a cop-vs-serial-killer formula better than a western
m/umberto_d," Heroes like Umberto D. are hard to find, and your life will be better for having met him."
m/un_amour_de_jeunesse," Love, expectations and realities form the river along which this delicate and moody film flows. There are no fireworks, stars and elation for the young protagonist, who discovers love. Instead, it is a painful experience, filled with longing..."
m/un_padre_no_tan_padre," Within its genre and its proposal the film is familiarly fun, you see it, you forget, but it entertains you. [Full review in Spanish]"
m/una_2017," The play has been superbly opened out, and the prowling cinematography of Thimios Bakatakis (Attenberg, The Lobster) and Fiona Crombie's cheerless sets combine to sustain an oppressive mood throughout."
m/una_noche_2013, Everything feels fake except the Centro Habana barrios themselves.
m/unaccompanied_minors," A winsome blend of Home Alone and The Breakfast Club, it's unabashedly silly kids' movie."
m/unborn_in_the_usa, The camera's shakiness and inability to focus on anything gave me a raging headache before 10 minutes had elapsed.
m/unbranded, What viewers will come away with most is a renewed appreciation for the natural beauty of both the western region of the country and the wild animals that inhabit it.
m/unbreakable," Polished but rarely compelling, Unbreakable is ultimately disappointing."
m/unbroken_2014, The film boasts both sheen and efficiency without always delivering an equivalent emotional impact. It's easier to be awed or impressed by it than moved.
m/unbroken_path_to_redemption," For the most part... the script hews to the typical dramatic contours of a marriage troubled by unemployment, unresolved anger, and alcoholism-pro forma stuff, too blandly treated to inspire much more than indifference."
m/uncertain," With enormous themes illustrated with the tiniest of creatures, the most characterful of characters, and some stunning photography, Uncertain is a phenomenal debut."
m/uncertain_terms," Heartbreaking, funny and truthful, with more depth crammed into 75 minutes than most manage in two hours."
m/uncertainty," For all of the earnest effort that Collins and Gordon-Levitt exert on characters that they created much improvised dialogue for, you're always aware of the narrative artifice surrounding them."
m/uncle_boonmee, A whimsical essay about the final days of a villager suffering from kidney failure it is undoubtedly one of the filmmaker's most accessible works.
m/uncle_buck," It's not John Hughes's best film, but it could be his funniest, as well as his saddest."
m/uncle_drew," Pepsi is one of film's producers, but painkiller Aleve gets better product placement. Spare some for the arthritic plot, please."
m/uncle_kent, It's a portrait of stunted middle-aged maturity that comes off as a performance of self-gratification.
m/uncle_kent_2, An animator has a personal meltdown in this absurdist comedy whose nerd-bro sensibilities are very much a matter of taste.
m/uncle_nick_2015, I spent the following 93 minutes wondering what kind of absurd bet Errol Morris must have lost to have his name associated with this dire project.
m/uncle_peckerhead," Laughing at death and guffawing at plumes of blood might not be for everyone in these dark times, but for the morbidly minded it is a delight."
m/uncle_sam, The worst of everything in the slasher subgenre consolidated into 89 endless minutes.
m/unconditional_2012," While the script is a bit thin and the murder mystery overlay feels a bit forced, Unconditional is a gentle and sincere movie about the power and potential of love. And Papa Joe is a character worth getting to know."
m/uncorked_2020," ""Uncorked"" is a familiar sort of story in a unique setting. The result is well-rounded, a bit too dry, yet it goes down with a pleasant finish."
m/uncovered_the_whole_truth_about_the_iraq_war," For a brief, artlessly spliced series of talking-head quotes, this documentary gives a remarkably thorough demolition of the Bush administration's concocted case against Iraq."
m/uncut_gems," Uncut Gems emerges as real gem itself, a sparkling comedy-drama about a compulsive gambler and risk-taker who never knows when to quit."
m/undead_2003," Unendurably boring in its superfluousness, its ersatz feel accentuated by a plethora of digital effects, Undead is simply a stiff"
m/undefeated_2012," At its best, Undefeated is a Hail Mary TD pass. Other times, it's a routine punt. Undefeated is an anthem of decency and empathy. It's also about living on the edge - of society and life."
m/under_fire, Presents a fascinating look at a journalist caught up in the tensions and violence in Nicaragua's civil war
m/under_our_skin," Under My Skin is well-produced and engaging, but it's also anecdotal and conspiratorial, and damnably non-confrontational."
m/under_siege," The tension and humor level tail off a bit toward the conclusion, but Steven Seagal and Chicago director Andy Davis clearly declare themselves as top-flight talent."
m/under_suspicion_1991, Fair mystery with interesting locations familiar to fans of The Prisoner.
m/under_the_bed_2012," A standard-issue creepshow, undermined by script holes and a meager budget that brings distinctly subpar effects."
m/under_the_boardwalk_the_monopoly_story_2010," More than you ever thought you could know about the world's favorite board game is here in this amiable but wandering, factoid-filled documentary."
m/under_the_bombs, Not many other films have had the hubris to ask for sympathy for an actress over and beyond the suffering of real people.
m/under_the_cherry_moon," Great looking, strange, not very effective, but an interesting effort"
m/under_the_eiffel_tower," The film is yet another ode to the restorative magic of wine country sunshine, which apparently also has the power to expose the story's egregious midlife-crisis clichés."
m/under_the_gun_2016," Soechtig's passionately contended, slickly produced film may not sway the most fervid 2nd Amendment defenders, but in its problem-solving vigor could spur a lot of others who believe in change to make that call, join that group, or vote a certain way."
m/under_the_roofs_of_paris, There's little to be gleaned from a plot that had already become tired 70 years ago.
m/under_the_same_moon_2008, I wasn't having any of it. I don't believe it's the bloodied hand of cynicism either; just a natural response to clumsy filmmaking at its most pandering and unfairly exclusionary.
m/under_the_sand, A compelling anatomy of grief as a solo journey through sorrow.
m/under_the_shadow," Under the Shadow has everything that makes great horror: a unique mythology that plagues us psychologically as well as viscerally, a confined setting (in this case culturally mandated confinement as well as physical) and good old scary monsters."
m/under_the_silver_lake," Really, though, Under the Silver Lake's most easily definable problem is a simple one: it's a little dull."
m/under_the_skin_2013," Picture a sister film to ""The Man Who Fell to Earth."" Glazer shares Nicolas Roeg's taste in elliptical storytelling and interplanetary tragedy, arriving at something you could almost call horror with a heart."
m/under_the_sun_2016," The movie raises disquieting questions, including a few that Mr. Mansky might not have meant to."
m/under_the_tuscan_sun," a Lifetime, chick-flick, movie-of-the-week on the big screen"
m/under_the_yum_yum_tree," Even with Lemmon bouncing in and out of comic situations, the comedy gets a little strained at times."
m/underclassman," Nick Cannon desperately wants to be Eddie Murphy, but doesn't have the script or depth to make it happen."
m/undercover_brother, A witty piece of genre deconstruction that's curiously drunk on pomo knowingness for both the mofo mystique of 70s blaxploitation and the mojo bull**** of James Bond.
m/underdog," Frederik Du Chau transforms the campy '60s and '70s cartoon into a mostly toothless, family-friendly action-comedy."
m/undertow," In the hands of a typical multiplex filmmaker, this would seem downright formulaic. But with Green and Orr at the reigns, things manage to seem fresh, exciting and different."
m/undertow_2009," The actors - particularly the drop-dead gorgeous Manolo Cardona - are compelling, with all three central characters benefiting from being well-defined and sympathetic."
m/underwater_2020," Yes it's ""Alien but underwater,"" and that's a good thing given how a top-notch Kristen Stewart leads us on a terrifying dive into the deepest reaches of aquatic horror."
m/underworld," Perhaps it's the idea, the atmosphere, or the enthusiastic action, but it maintains a mysterious watchability which suggests it could become a cult classic."
m/underworld_awakening, Yet more vampire vs werewolf battles from the fang franchise that is even more boring than Twilight. Strictly for completists.
m/underworld_blood_wars_2017," Underworld: Blood Wars, the fifth instalment, has little to recommend it on any level."
m/underworld_evolution," Stylish, but doesn't really re-imagine the vampire genre, cluttering the screen with creatures that no longer shock or surprise us. It's also a bit too long to pack a mean punch."
m/underworld_rise_of_the_lycans," The film tends to forget that these are supernatural creatures (it's not scary at all), and it quickly turns into a pretty standard-issue ""revolt of the slaves"" action picture (with very poor action scenes)."
m/undiscovered," After a promising start, the script begins to sound like it was written by little girls playing Barbies."
m/undisputed," If you're into quality title overlays, then you won't want to miss this one"
m/undrafted_2016," Movies inspired by or based on a filmmaker's youthful life can be masterpieces...or, as in the case of the baseball comedy Undrafted, something that's heartfelt and personal and might have worked better as a drama but just isn't funny."
m/une_vieille_maitresse, That rare period piece in which characters and their relationships are rendered with as much precision and detail as the set and costumes.
m/unexpected_2015, Cobie Smulders and Gail Bean are sublime as expectant mothers in Kris Swanberg's breakout work.
m/unfaithful, Has all the intrigue and allure of one of those International Coffee commercials.
m/unfinished_business_2015," You can see the fear in Vaughn's eyes as another gag limps to its payoff, another scene fails to deliver anything but stony silence where the laugh is supposed to be."
m/unfinished_life, Lasse Hallstrom never met a case of advanced emotional constipation he couldn't unplug in two psychobabbly hours or less.
m/unfinished_song, ...a crowd-pleaser along the lines of such similarly-themed fare as Calendar Girls and The Full Monty.
m/unfit_the_psychology_of_donald_trump," A scattershot anti-Trump doc, centered around the somewhat questionable notion that psychiatrists should diagnose specific mental illnesses in public figures who aren't their patients"
m/unforgettable," A tight, tense, taut thriller with a killer-sting in it's tail"
m/unforgettable_2017," The film is so inept, it starts with a teaser of sorts that basically spoils the whole film."
m/unforgivable_2012," Techine lavishes upon us not just scenery and characters but complications and emotional turmoil in pursuit of subtlety. If this seems perverse, it most certainly is."
m/unfriended," Most horror fans will be delighted by strong, subtle performances, clever audience manipulation and a truly fresh and new approach to what had become a hackneyed genre."
m/unfriended_dark_web," Unfriended: Dark Web is still a viciously entertaining experience, even if it isn't nearly as much fun as its predecessor and gets slightly bogged down by its own mythologies in the end."
m/unhook_the_stars," Cassavetes conveys a warmth and easygoing style that are rare in American cinema these days, and he's assembled a first-rate cast to help him give this familiar yarn a compelling spin."
m/unicorn_store," Brie Larson's directorial debut falls short on a modest goal rather than taking a big, ambitious swing."
m/uninvited_2009," Once the pieces became clear that directors Charles & Thomas Guard were content on being M. Night Shyamalan instead of Ji-Woon Kim, it's enough to make any purist feeling tainted."
m/union_2019, The film has its moments but the canvas is too sprawling to give them the chance to effectively emerge.
m/union_square_2012," Sisters engage in tedious, seemingly unending melodramatics."
m/united_93," A few people made extraordinary use of those tormented minutes, and United 93 fully honors what was original and spontaneous and brave in their refusal to go quietly."
m/united_passions," All that cash flowing into Fifa's coffers, and they spent it on this tripe?"
m/united_red_army," Despite the languorous 190-minute running time, ""United Red Army"" is a brutal and relentless onslaught."
m/united_states_of_leland," Though it might seem unfair to compare it to Donnie Darko and American Beauty, two of the finer movies of the last decade, comparisons are certainly valid."
m/united_we_fan," It's a fun film to watch, but also one that makes us question how far we're all willing to go to save our favourite series from extinction, and where the future of such fan campaigns might be going from here."
m/universal_soldier," With no real plot tying them together, the impressively staged big scenes become empty exercises in logistics, while the smaller scenes never develop any momentum."
m/universal_soldier_day_of_reckoning, A mash-up of bad vid-game effects and giggle-inducing splatter-movie gore.
m/universal_soldier_the_return," If the world is ever to be truly safe from Universal Soldiers, they, like Achilles, can suffer a mortal wound in only one place. For them, it's the box office."
m/unknown_2011," Unknown is anything but, with predictable plot points found in better movies, yet the sturdy presence of Liam Neeson saves it from action movie obscurity."
m/unlawful_entry," The movie is a thriller, with all the usual trappings of a thriller, but the director, Jonathan Kaplan, is able to place the story in a plausible world."
m/unleashed_2017," Sweet romantic comedy-fantasy has some language, sex."
m/unlocked_2017, Unlocked rattles along at a very brisk pace and is full of action set-pieces.
m/unlovable," It's a fluffy spin on the recovery genre, but it's a fresh one, and deGuzman's hard-won life experience adds veracity and honesty to the snappy narrative."
m/unloved," Funny, real, poetic and frightening, not the gruelling tract about neglect you might expect."
m/unmistaken_child, The documentary stands as a visually candid and picturesque peek into one of the world's most mysterious practices.
m/unplanned," A kind of cinematic personal testimony, told from Johnson's post-conversion point of view...crafted specifically for Pure Flix's target audience, an audience that is already pro-life."
m/unreasonable_man," An Unreasonable Man takes the story of a man usually associated with being an egomaniac, megalomaniac and even psychologically disturbed and creates a fascinating account of a man typically known just for rabblerousing two elections."
m/unsane," The film has a ragbag of themes including stalking, mental illness and the private medical insurance racket; these competing ideas cancel each other out and aren't scary."
m/unsinkable_molly_brown, Debbie Reynolds received her only Oscar nomination for playing the title role of this artistically mediocre but commercially popular musical comedy about the rags to riches of the Denver heroine who was also a passenger on the Titanic.
m/unstoppable-2010, Unstoppable is a surprisingly taut and entertaining train thriller which takes old ideas and breathes modern life into them.
m/until_the_birds_return, An intriguing first feature from writer-director Karim Moussaoui that explores the damaged emotional landscape of his homeland.
m/until_the_light_takes_us," Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell's absorbing, low-key documentary ""Until the Light Takes Us"" recounts how a few Norwegian musicians hijacked an obscure offshoot of heavy metal and made it world famous."
m/untitled, A laugh-out-loud satire with a dry-martini wit ... consistently surprising and funny without pandering for laughs.
m/untitled_eliot_spitzer_project," The doc's talking heads are fascinating, including the creepy Home Depot founder Ken Langone and weasely AIG CEO Hank Greenberg."
m/untouchable_2019, Where Untouchable excels... is in capturing the complexities surrounding sexual assault.
m/untouchables," A big film, an exciting film, and it will likely be the big film of the summer."
m/unzipped, What is interesting is that Unzipped displays the enchantment and prestige of the fashion world but simultaneously demystifies the artificial glam surrounding it.
m/up, Pixar triumphs again with a delirious fantasy that has one leg in the real world of hopes dashed and realised and the other in the cartoon tradition of journeying and adventure.
m/up_and_down," The Czech Republic's nominee for the best foreign film Oscar skips from buoyant satire to domestic melodrama, leaving behind a curious mix of emotions."
m/up_close_and_personal, Love story about two soul-mates who are willing to do whatever it takes to enable the other to shine.
m/up_for_grabs," Even if you know how this ends, this story will keep you in its grips."
m/up_in_smoke_1978," A cult drug movie that lacks decent acting, script or direction."
m/up_in_the_air_2009, Laughs and heartbreak meld seamlessly in this brilliant character drama.
m/up_on_the_glass, Del Principe builds his house of cards with such assurance and precision that you can't help but get involved.
m/up_the_academy," Notable only because its star, Ron Liebman, sued the studio to have his name removed from the credits and advertising."
m/up_the_yangtze," [Director Yung Chang] and lenser Wang Shi Qing use powerful images, subtlety and a little humour to apprise the viewer of the human and cultural issues at stake."
m/upgrade_2018, Upgrade has cookie-cutter characters and a plot twist you can spot from miles away.
m/upside_down_2012," Upside Down is a film built on binary elements -- lavishly and ambitiously executed -- yet with its laughably undercooked romantic core, it remains foolishly stubborn towards anything more nuanced."
m/upside_of_anger, A fiercely funny human comedy with jokes that sting and leave marks.
m/upstream_color, Upstream Color is a very layered and complex movie. But it's also rich and beautiful. I expect nothing less from the crowded and radiant mind of Shane Carruth.
m/uptown_girls, An utterly vacuous bit of fluff...one of those clumsy concoctions in which every element rings false and all the seams show.
m/urban_hymn," One of the most beautiful, heartbreaking and tender films of the year."
m/urban_legend," As interesting as the urban legend premise is, it's not enough to sustain the movie."
m/urban_legends_bloody_mary," Though it's purportedly the third installment of the ongoing Urban Legends series, Bloody Mary feels more like a half-baked Ring ripoff than anything else."
m/urban_legends_final_cut, How Jennifer Morrison and Matthew Davis keep straight faces through it all is beyond me.
m/urbanized_2011," Even viewers with deep knowledge of modern urban planning are likely to learn something from the carefully selected images and thoughtful interviews that make up most of ""Urbanized."""
m/urge," The lack of any likable characters ultimately undoes ""Urge."" Kaufman and Stahl have made a classic party-throwers mistake: overrating the entertainment value in watching other people get high."
m/urok_2015," With a steady pace and slowly rising tension, the Bulgarian drama ""The Lesson"" catalogs the minor miseries in the life of a well-meaning schoolteacher, which accumulate in a way that's both absurd and utterly realistic."
m/us_2019," Peele directs Us with a masterful collection of horror-movie tricks - jump scares that actually pay off, a cat-and-mouse game in an isolated place filled with bright lights and deep pools of impenetrable shadow."
m/us_and_them," With frothing energy and unfettered vulgarity, ""Us and Them"" lances the boil of working-class grievance and watches as the infection spreads to everyone in its path."
m/us_and_them_2018," Taiwanese singer-actress Rene Liu makes her directorial debut with Us And Them, the kind of decade-spanning love story which could easily be condensed into one of her wistful pop songs but nonetheless proves sincerely affecting..."
m/us_marshals," This technically efficient spin-off of The Fugitive is a mind-boggling letdown. Chase, cover-up crash, chase, cover-up, jump, chase."
m/us_vs_john_lennon," Explicitly, the film is pure fluff, a competently detailed catalog of Lennon's political ambitions told in the visual shorthand of the VH1 rock-doc."
m/use_me, ...a taught thriller that blurs the lines between documentary and narrative filmmaking to examine a deeper truth about addiction and taboo.
m/used_cars," It's also one of the funniest ruminations on American values, as the car showroom becomes a warped microcosm of society."
m/used_people," Mastroianni and MacLaine are both fine, but the film is a little too cutesy for its own good."
m/useless_humans," the obvious joy with which the director, writers, and cast attack The material is infectious at times, but the scattershot sloppiness inherent in these types of films keeps the audience at arm's length."
m/ushpizin, Adorable folk tale that could have come from I. Bashevis Singer's pen.
m/uss_indianapolis_men_of_courage," Nicolas Cage headlines this lethargic, chintzy retelling of the tragedy that befell the USS Indianapolis during World War II."
m/usual_suspects," Certain 'big twists' may have hogged the limelight of late, but rarely have they come 'bigger' or better than in Bryan Singer's glorious exercise in taut intrigue, dazzling plotting and criminal psychology."
m/v_for_vendetta," We have here something that we rarely see in SF films these days... a movie about ideas over action, character over special effects, and emotion over action."
m/v_tumane_2012," A ponderous trudge at times, it is ultimately worth the journey."
m/va_savoir," Throughout this aerial confection, 'real life' and artifice are intriguingly intertwined."
m/vacancy," The way in which it gets off on the violence -- and, ostensibly, hopes the audience does the same -- is especially distasteful and, frankly, misogynistic."
m/vacation_2013," It is a catalogue of victimization, a road map of pain, a desperate cry for help."
m/vacationland," Though Verow attended the American Film Institute and has made more than a dozen shorts and features since 1994, his low-budget gay-themed films are characterized by phenomenal indifference to framing, sound quality and performance."
m/vai, A bold experience that rightly highlights the need for more Pasifika cinema.
m/valentine," Blanks ... appears to be carving himself a career making slasher movies for a new generation; unfortunately, he's in no way improving on the originals."
m/valentine_road_2013, One of the most powerful films you'll see this year or maybe any year.
m/valentines_day_2010," Valentine's Day is like a box of fancy chocolates from a secret admirer. Intentions may be genuine, but knowing nothing about the other party kills off meaning or a reason to care."
m/valentino_the_last_emperor," Tyrnauer succeeds in making a documentary in which man and his creations are one and the same. Yes, Valentino lives in opulence, but his gowns exist in that stratosphere too."
m/valerian_and_the_city_of_a_thousand_planets, Luc Besson returns with a space oddity so high on its own supply that it makes Guardians of the Galaxy look like an Ozu film.
m/valerie_and_her_week_of_wonders, Viewers willing to just accept Valerie's beautiful surrealism will probably feel their time was better rewarded than those who will need to have it all figured out.
m/valhalla_rising," Bonus points for taking a wide berth around all familiar Viking stereotypes, but since the rest of the film is so alienating, dull and generally unpleasant, it's not just the characters suffering through a hellish experience."
m/valiant, Valiant is the plucky little outsider with a lot of heart
m/valiant_2019," A crowd-pleasing sports story, of course, but more importantly an uplifting tale of how a city can strive to overcome a time of unimaginable loss and pain; and it's well-told."
m/valkyrie," A coolly efficient, entertaining and straightforward tale about the last of 15 known assassination attempts against Adolf Hitler."
m/valley_girl_2020," Hollow musical remake is out of tune; drinking, language."
m/valley_of_the_dolls, It's an unbelievably hackneyed and mawkish mish-mash of backstage plots and Peyton Place adumbrations.
m/valmont," It's a warm, energetic, humorous film, with some excellent ensemble playing; but the cruelty and psychological complexity are lost, and the ensuing tragedy has little resonance."
m/vampire_academy," Ultimately more ""Meaningless"" than ""Mean Girls,"" ""Vampire Academy"" is a busy, overcomplicated empowerment fantasy with more hormones than brain cells."
m/vampire_in_brooklyn," This modern fable is little more than a Murphy potboiler, something to while away a couple of hours, rather than fondly remember."
m/vampires_assistant," Is it too much to ask that a narrative film have a beginning, a middle, and an end?"
m/vampires_kiss, Kooky vampire flick gives us an already neurotic Nicolas Cage slowly turning into one of them after receiving a bite.
m/vampires_los_muertos," Despite a handful of worthwhile horror moments, Vampires: Los Muertos is almost entirely dead on arrival."
m/vampires_suck," The best recent parody movie. Not because it's good, but because it's only unbelievably boring while the others were unbearably irritating."
m/vamps_2011," Aging is probably the real theme here, but it's approached sidelong and has no punch. Still, only the nostalgia has any real conviction."
m/vampyr_der_traum_des_allan_grey," Haunting and beautiful, Dreyer's horror film is both essential viewing for vampire buffs and one of the most inscrutable yet rewarding experiences in movie history."
m/vampyros_lesbos," Extremely prolific and generally untalented, Jess Franco is the Spanish Ed Wood, albeit without Wood's gift for humorously inane dialogue."
m/van_gogh," Maurice Pialat's intense, bleak re-creation of the painter's last days ..."
m/van_helsing, The epitome of everything that's wrong with $150 million B-movies.
m/van_wilder_2," Rather than pushing the envelope, the movie draws pictures of boobies on the envelope and tries to pass that off as comedy."
m/vanilla_2020, Much of the film gets by on Dennis and Bauman-Murphy's chemistry together.
m/vanilla_sky," Feels enervated and logy, its energy sucked into the vacuum of Tom Cruise's star power."
m/vanishing_on_7th_street, Comes across like an unscary episode of 'The Twilight Zone.' Whatever point the director is trying to make is anybody's guess.
m/vanishing_waves_2012, Excellent production values and a standout performance by Jurga Jutaite as immovable victim and movingly vulnerable dream girl...make this one to catch
m/vanity_fair," Like The House of Mirth -- more so, when you think about both pictures being headed by amber-haired actresses who are in way over their heads."
m/vantage_point, A stale effort that seems content to find its niche in a harmless mediocrity.
m/vanya_on_42nd_street," Even if you don't get everything there is to get, it's an incredibly unique film worth seeing."
m/varsity_blues, A paint-by-numbers story that offers no surprises and a hero and villain etched in white and black with few shades of gray.
m/vatel," For all the opulence, there's a distinct overall glumness in tone."
m/vaxxed_from_cover_up_to_catastrophe_2016," ""Vaxxed"" should come with a warning label: ""May cause irrational anxiety, especially if taken with an empty head."""
m/vazante, A minor Greek tragedy transposed to colonial Brazil.
m/veer_zaara," Veer Zaara has a great storyline with some unpredictable twists and emotions, keeping you engrossed throughout."
m/vegas_vacation," There should be a self-help group where insecure people make themselves feel better by constantly repeating: ""He's Chevy Chase and I'm not."""
m/vehicle_19_2013, It's pure formula...but will give Fast and Furious fans something to drool over until the next F&F instalment comes skidding around the corner.
m/velvet_buzzsaw," There's enough fun, writerly glee and actors enjoying their little rampages to make Velvet Buzzsaw a decent distraction for a couple of hours, but also something of a schizophrenic case all its own."
m/velvet_goldmine," While some gay men's fantasies center around muscled jocks, cops or cowboys, Todd Haynes' would seem to be of a slightly more arcane bent."
m/velveteen_rabbit," The live-action cast may be unknowns, but they're effective enough; the 2-D (drawn and digital) animation is winning; and the story will engross any 8-and-younger with the patience to watch it."
m/vendetta_2013, Danny Dyer is back on familiar 'ardman turf in this cement-headed vigilante thriller.
m/vengeance_is_mine_1979," Gripping and haunting, it's a strikingly timeless film."
m/vengeance_valley," It is no Red River or Stagecoach, but it offers a strong plot and some excellent scenery and action."
m/venom_2018," One assumes that the second or third homes Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams purchased with their paychecks was worth the experience of making this misguided, gobsmacking mess."
m/venus," Witty dialog and a strong story keep it thoroughly entertaining, as do the sparky performances."
m/venus_and_serena," A lot of the sibling bond, a little of the sibling rivalry and just a hint of the controversy that makes these tennis players so fascinating."
m/venus_in_fur," ...beneath a brittle veneer of verbal dash and cleverness this stagebound adaptation has little insight to give us into anything except the sexual hubris of an aging man, and frankly, we're not sure we give a damn."
m/vera_drake," The title heroine's goodness may stretch credulity, but such people do in fact exist."
m/verdict, Paul Newman goes into court a drunken bum and comes out a better man in this superb legal drama about a man finding redemption.
m/verdict_on_auschwitz_the_frankfurt_trial_1963_1965_2007, Verdict on Auschwitz similarly juxtaposes archival footage and postwar material (both 1963 and 1993) to produce shocking eruptions of past atrocities in the context of an orderly everyday Europe.
m/vernon_florida, a Platonic dialogue in that it's suspiciously like a monologue disguised as an exchange.
m/veronica_guerin," Blanchett brings her expected professionalism and ability to the role. Her Irish accent is perfect, and she has the charisma and presence to easily hold center stage."
m/veronica_mars," Veronica is still hard as nails yet also, in her honest self-appraisal, as soft as a marshmallow - a description that unfortunately also applies to the movie."
m/verotika," Verotika should be the most boring film ever made, but its editing is so consistently terrible, and bafflingly so, that even audiences unfamiliar with editing conventions will find it captivating and hilarious."
m/vertical_limit," O'Donnell's lazy, inexpressive performance here should prove to the suits once and for all that this walking, talking rice cake incarnate does not have what it takes to become a major star."
m/vertigo," It may not be as funny or light as the best known of Hitchcock's work but this is certainly a classic largely because of it's impressively unlikeable, intense characters so at odds with Hitch's trademark Hollywood glamour films of the same time."
m/very_bad_things," Peter Berg's Very Bad Things isn't a bad movie, just a reprehensible one."
m/very_brady_sequel," As far as parodies are concerned, this one just isn't particularly funny."
m/very_good_girls, Very Good Girls is a film one wants to like but can't. It just doesn't work.
m/very_harold_and_kumar_christmas," A raunchy and religiously-incorrect roller coaster ride for the very-open minded, not to be mistaken for one of those sentimental Christmas yarns you usually see during the holiday season."
m/very_young_girls, [A] heartbreaking look at the trafficking of underage girls in New York City.
m/veteran_2015," An unremarkable crime tale, one whose plot often feels more the stuff of a brash one-hour TV procedural than a two-hour feature film."
m/vfw, A gory and fun throwback to '80s punk rock action movies.
m/vhs, It's telling that the most satisfying segment in V/H/S was directed by a group called Radio Silence.
m/vhs_viral," a fast and furious barrage of in-your-face mayhem and digital trickery, perhaps no better than its predecessors, but certainly more varied and more constantly arresting."
m/vhyes," The comedy here is high enough that simply being funny would have been enough, but VHYes strives for meaning as well, which is what makes the film such a special delight."
m/vi_warshawski," Turner wants to play up Warshawski's detective instincts while Disney would rather ogle with the intensity of a Mormon, unsure how to successfully launch a franchise like this without alienating male audiences."
m/vice_2015," Here's hoping Bruce Willis bought something special with whatever cash he earned from this pointless, brutally ugly rehash of 1973's ""Westworld."""
m/vice_2018, Christian Bale is mind-blowingly amazing in the lead role. Let's give him the Oscar right now.
m/vice_squad," a B-movie in prestige picture clothing, albeit the cinematic equivalent of a designer tube top."
m/viceroys_house," ""Viceroy's House"" clumsily merges a waxworks biographical study of Lord Louis and Lady Edwina Mountbatten ... with a passionless Romeo-and-Juliet romance between two of their servants caught in the fray."
m/vicious_kind, The characters spend far too much time working through their problems with drama-deadening directness.
m/vicky_cristina_barcelona," The movie compulsively hits fast-forward every time Woody interrupts the action with voice-over narration from an extraneous male narrator, but is nonetheless an improvement by degrees over his last film ""Cassandra's Dream."""
m/victim_1962, One can only hope this re-release awakens people to the true power of Basil Dearden's film and the extraordinary bravery of Dirk Bogarde's performance.
m/victim_2012," The set-ups are familiar, the characters well worn and the film-makers' message (we are all victims) writ cornily large. But co-writer Chin is an imposing screen presence of whom we may expect more in future."
m/victor-victoria," Blake Edwards's 1982 sex comedy has the most beautiful range of tones of any American film of its period: it is a work of dry wit, high slapstick, black despair, romantic warmth, and penetrating intelligence."
m/victor_crowley," Whilst some studios try and get some more mileage out of the classic horror icons, Crowley is a welcome original."
m/victor_frankenstein_2015," Enjoy it for what it is: Sanitized, family friendly popcorn entertainment with a few laughs and a modicum of excitement."
m/victoria_2015, Victoria ultimately comes off as an excessively erratic and punishingly overlong drama that never quite lives up to its potential.
m/victoria_and_abdul," What a peculiarly dodgy, conservative film this is - a lazy salute to a good queen and her faithful Indian servant."
m/vida_sin_rumbo," At times the perversely slow beat of each scene can irritate, but that's a reasonable price for the film's super-saturated atmosphere."
m/vidal_sassoon_the_movie, Craig Teper's documentary profile of the legendary hairdresser veers dangerously close to hagiography.
m/video_games_the_movie, Video Games: The Movie opens with a barrage of statistics before segueing into a sketchy history lesson-cum-industry promotion.
m/videocracy," A stylized, scattershot inquiry into Italy's TV-dominated culture, Videocracy is a portrait of 21st-century media fascism."
m/videodrome," Nearly twenty years after Videodrome was shot, it still feels contemporary."
m/viena_and_the_fantomes," Has the feel of a compromised movie, with a brief running time and a choppy, impressionistic structure that comes off like it has pieces missing."
m/view_from_the_top, This blas hodgepodge can't decide whether it wants to be a romantic comedy or an absurd send-up of believe-in-yourself inspirational dramas.
m/view_to_a_kill," This isn't the best Bond movie, but like all of the Bonds, it does provide two hours of fairly solid escapism."
m/vigilante_diaries," Vigilante Diaries is a comprehensive disaster. Close the book on this diary, there's nothing exciting to be found here."
m/viking_destiny," Of Gods and Monsters is unlikely to trigger rapturous applause from whoever is watching, but is more than satisfying and sees a strong cast work their magic."
m/vikingdom," Once you look past the carnage, special effects and colossal locales, all you're left with is the supper show at Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament."
m/vikings," As the massive battle scenes and convoluted political machinations paraded across the screen, I thought, ""This was the Braveheart of the 1950s!"" and I was right."
m/viktor," Aside from some inspired uses of chiaroscuro lighting, the movie around Depardieu is mostly derivative ..."
m/village," The Village needs a shot of Viagra ... needs to be scarier, more sinister, more shocking, and more emotional."
m/village_barbershop, The only reason to see this modest indie drama is an affecting performance by John Ratzenberger.
m/villain_1971," If you enjoy a good gangster film or just want to luxuriate in an arguably incongruous but never less than hypnotic performance, it comes recommended."
m/villain_2020," Any movie containing the line ""You need to grab that hacksaw and start on his legs"" is already halfway to winning me over, and Philip Barantini's ""Villain"" does not disappoint."
m/vincent_and_theo, a humanistic exposition akin to Surviving Picasso and Pollock
m/vincent_n_roxxy," Schultz cranks up aggression and ends up suffocating the effort, displaying a callous disregard for tone to go with the feature's overall incompleteness."
m/vincere, He creates an intimate mood while alluding to the general feel of the highly chronicled era without going too far over the top or reconstructing elaborate sets.
m/viola_2013, Pieiro unearths every bit of thought and feeling contained in this mercurial feature's brief running time ...
m/violet_2017," It's formally engaging, particularly in its use of sound (and silence), but it's also understated to the point of being comatose."
m/violet_and_daisy," It wants to be ""Clueless"" meets Gregg Araki, but it has far less on its mind than the former teen classic and not nearly enough provocative material to match the latter indie director's sensibilities."
m/violeta_went_to_heaven, poignant portrait of an artist unable to escape the stamp of her class or the burdens of aging.
m/violette_2013," Provost's film, like its heroine, is full of active, sparking nerves."
m/viral_2016, It has more than a few eerie and intelligent deviations from the undead movie template to make it worth watching.
m/virgin_suicides," This shimmery, darkly comic adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel marks the assured, often inspired feature film debut of writer-director Sofia Coppola."
m/viridiana," Whether Señor Buñuel means his picture as a reflection of all people or just the people of Spain is not clear nor, indeed, is it essential. It is an ugly, depressing view of life. And, to be frank about it, it is a little old-fashioned, too."
m/virtual_jfk," With its fascinating central question (What if ... ) and well-chosen, nostalgic footage of John F. Kennedy in his prime, this well-played documentary manages to escape the fate of other dry historical overviews."
m/virtuosity," It takes a while to get rolling, and the early character development is weak, but pretty soon, everyone's caught up in this innovative take on the cat and mouse game."
m/vision_2010," Although its claims about Hildegard's modernity and relevancy should be taken with a grain of salt, one readily imagines Vision attracting a cross-section of the curious, not limited to feminist cinephiles and true believers."
m/vision_quest_1985," That's the problem with all of ""Vision Quest"" -- when the movie ends with Louden narrating off-screen his ""live for today"" philosophy, it's plausible in his mouth, a joke for adults."
m/visions_of_8_the_olympics_of_motion_picture_achievement," Visions of Eight is an excellent record of the 1972 Munich Olympics, a collage imaginatively recording the event from varied perspectives, each with a different focus."
m/visitors_2013," [Reggio's] formal devices haven't changed in 30 years, and the po-faced presentation, once hypnotically strange and cosmic, now feels like an overused gimmick."
m/visual_acoustics_the_modernism_of_julius_shulman," Gives a convincing, contagious taste of its protagonist's playful optimism."
m/vita_and_virginia," In this mannered literary period piece, the story of the love affair between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West is too hampered by tonal and pacing issues to ever ignite."
m/viva_knievel, Evel Knievel stars as Evel Knievel in a film about Evel Knievel. Nothing more need be said.
m/viva_las_vegas, The sizzling combination of Elvis Presley and Ann-Margaret is enough to carry Viva Las Vegas over the top.
m/viva_riva," The debut of writer-director Djo Munga, who's from the DRC and studied filmmaking in Belgium, Viva Riva! has a sleek international sheen."
m/viva_zapata," Elia Kazan places an interesting and honest spotlight upon politics, which proves that left wing liberators are just as dangerous as the right wing fascists they have overpowered, and vice versa."
m/vivan_las_antipodas_2012," Unlike, say, similar globetrotting, image-led works like Koyaanisqatsi or Baraka, Kossakovsky's film is never preachy, allowing the visuals to percolate."
m/vivarium, Everyone is on fine form in this unsettling horror that aligns up-and-coming director Lorcan Finnegan with Yorgos Lanthimos' assaults on domesticity.
m/vive_lamour_1994," Focusing on lives that come into physical contact yet remain separate the director conveys sexual desire in erotically charged manner, including a powerful masturbation scene"
m/voice_from_the_stone, In none of its manifestations is grief as tidy and meticulously arranged as in Eric D. Howell's film.
m/volcanoes-of-the-deep-sea," An incredible robot's-eye view of the adventures of Alvin, a vehicle that is essentially a backwards space probe."
m/volunteers," No Time After Time or Star Trek 6, but you gotta love Candy."
m/volver," Volver (literally, 'to return') finds Spain's favorite cinematic son Pedro Almodovar at the peak of his powers."
m/von_ryans_express, The cinematography and the scenery both add greatly to the movie. It makes it seem so much more realistic.
m/voodoo_2017," It's more gimmicky than scary, and little of it makes any sense."
m/vor-the-thief," The film falls short as a romance, however, never achieving the depths for which writer-director Chukhrai clearly strives."
m/vox_lux," Even while being anti-pop, this movie isn't anti-pleasure; its craft is sumptuous and encompassing."
m/voyage_of_the_damned," Besides carrying the impact of an issue morally greater than the fate of individuals, the film is a study in personal heroism, cowardice, dignity, fear, hope and betrayal."
m/voyage_to_the_bottom_of_the_sea," Amusing, attractive, now somewhat quaint sci-fi flick."
m/voyeur_2017," ""Voyeur"" leaves you intrigued but not fully satisfied. There's a third voyeur here: the movie itself. It keeps staring, trying to make sense of the bizarre tale it shows us, but it never quite breaks through the glass and touches it."
m/vulgar," Nasty, ugly, pointless and depressing, even if you hate clowns."
m/w_2008," Brilliant, engrossing, and terrifying. Brolin is a revelation."
m/wackness, A great script and one of the more innovative indie comedies in recent memory.
m/waco_the_rules_of_engagement," If you believe the US government is only looking out for your interests, I defy you to watch this film and not find your viewpoint altered."
m/wadjda_2013," A satisfying and skilfully made film is always something to celebrate, but largely due to the circumstances from which it arose, Wadjda feels like one of the year's most vital."
m/wag_the_dog," Barry Levinson has always had a wicked sense of humor, but never has it been in fuller flower."
m/wages_of_fear," The Wages of Fear is a frantic, vicious, existentialist howl that still manages to laugh; it goes grinning into the void."
m/wagon_master," one of Ford's masterworks, a sublime, crisp, unpretentious western that doesn't wear its mythos on its sleeve"
m/wagons_east," A ghastly western parody that does not honor Uncle Buck's memory, but exploits his last, pitiable appeal for laughter."
m/wah-do-dem," Slight but winning and often funny, the scrappy Amerindie Wah Do Dem is a fish-out-of-water comedy driven by Sean ""Bones"" Sullivan's offbeat performance."
m/wah_wah, ...we've seen this sort of film countless times before...
m/waist_deep," It seemed impossible that Vondie Curtis Hall could direct a movie that's as bad as Glitter, but he has: Waist Deep. And Mariah Carey is nowhere in sight."
m/wait_until_dark," Wait Until Dark, Frederick Knott's gimmicky stage play about a blind woman terrorized by crooks, was brought to the screen in 1967 and was accompanied by an even more outlandish gimmick."
m/waiting, The rest of the laughs (when they eventually arrive; the first half hour is kinda bleak) are mostly scraped from the pit of your roiling stomach.
m/waiting-for-forever, An indistinct romantic-dramedy-ish something or other.
m/waiting_city, The Waiting City is a beautifully crafted bitter-sweet exploration of a functional but near-broken relationship exposed by this perpetually functional but near-broken city.
m/waiting_for_anya," Despite its laudable intentions, Waiting for Anya proves less impactful than it should be."
m/waiting_for_armageddon, It's scary to see how many of my fellow Americans believe this stuff.
m/waiting_for_guffman, The nonstop amusing mockumentary Waiting for Guffman does to small-town acting troupes what This Is Spinal Tap did to heavy-metal bands.
m/waiting_for_lightning_2012," With Danny Way almost never weighing in directly, the film's attempts to portray his story as an inspirational tale of triumph over adversity scarcely registers."
m/waiting_for_superman," Exhilarating, heartbreaking and righteous, Waiting for Superman is also a kind of high-minded thriller: Can the American education system be cured?"
m/waiting_for_the_barbarians_2020," ...an insightful allegory about the ravages of colonialism, with a fine script by JM Coetzee from his acclaimed novel."
m/waiting_to_exhale," The male-bashing taken to an extreme in Waiting to Exhale is starting to seem a little like crack for the female psyche, exhilarating in the short term but ultimately crippling and dangerous."
m/waitress," I loved this movie. Loved every last character, twist, kiss, joke and pie found within it."
m/wake-wood," For all its pre-Christian paganism, demon child imagery, blood and guts, David Keating's rural horror movie is at heart an involving portrait of a young couple struggling to come to terms with the death of a daughter."
m/wake_in_fright," A riveting film with exceptional relevance today in its cultural veracity and its observation of not just outback Australian society (if you can call it that), but in human nature."
m/wakefield," It would have been asking a lot from any actor to carry this film, and Cranston has done the heavy lifting and more."
m/waking_life," Whether it's a product of stoic contemplation or reefer madness, Linklater's waking life becomes an elusive, one-way vehicle to God."
m/waking_ned_devine," There's no particular message or great meaning to be found in writer-director Kirk Jones' film, just some good fun and a few hearty laughs."
m/waking_sleeping_beauty," A documentary about the lucrative rebirth of Disney's animation arm between the years 1984 and 1994, it's a warts-and-all tale of clashing egos and the eternal war between art and commerce."
m/waking_the_dead, The movie is so comatose that audiences will want to shake it or do something to wake it up.
m/waking_up_in_reno," Offers big, fat, dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in. Ah, what the hell."
m/wal_mart_the_high_cost_of_low_price," With little fanfare, Robert Greenwald has become one of the most incisive activist filmmakers in America."
m/waldo_on_weed, An uncommonly sweet documentary about a uniquely Philly character and his very special son.
m/walk_away_renee_2011," Hermetic, autobiographical, messy, and ultimately touching."
m/walk_hard," The tricky thing about parody movies is that the jokes get old fast and they're hit-and-miss. Walk Hard is guilty on both counts. How lucky that when the jokes do hit, they kick major ass."
m/walk_of_shame_2013, A solid vehicle for Elizabeth Banks to show off her comedic chops
m/walk_on_the_moon, A beautifully acted drama about infidelity in the summer of 1969 when astronauts landed on the moon and the counterculture celebrated sexual liberation at Woodstock.
m/walk_on_water," In Eytan Fox's Walk on Water, the Sea of Galilee is paved with good intentions."
m/walk_the_line," Walk the Line is a strongly acted, musically vibrant, conventionally satisfying biopic."
m/walk_to_remember, Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV's Dawson's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story.
m/walk_with_me_2017," A beautiful study of Zen Buddhism, and a powerful evocation of the dedication and courage needed to go on their particular journey."
m/walkabout," For the most part, Walkabout is an involving, occasionally hypnotic, motion picture."
m/walking_and_talking," a totally charming, though lightweight, look at a childhood friendship"
m/walking_on_sunshine," Six scenes end with someone falling hilariously into a swimming pool. I minded enough to keep a tally, but not enough to bear a grudge. It's that kind of film."
m/walking_out," [Alex and Andrew Smith] can always be counted on to make smart, evocative films about masculinity and the foundational relationship (or lack thereof) between fathers and sons. Their new film Walking Out once again delivers the goods."
m/walking_tall, This Walking Tall loses in depth what it gains in star power.
m/walking_with_dinosaurs_3d," Unfortunately, there's no majestic visual this movie can't undercut with bathroom humor as the charmless characters chatter simply to fill the space. Not even aurora borealis is spared."
m/walking_with_the_enemy," After 20 shaky opening minutes, first-time director Mark Schmidt finds his footing with this slightly overlong English-language Holocaust drama."
m/wall_e," WALL*E, an animated robot love story with an environmental message and a slapstick delivery, is a charmer of a film and a delightful piece of storytelling."
m/wall_street," Wall Street isn't a movie to make one think. It simply confirms what we all know we should think, while giving us a tantalizing, Sidney Sheldon-like peek into the boardrooms and bedrooms of the rich and powerful."
m/wall_street_money_never_sleeps," Stone, who has always expressed surprise that Gekko became a cult hero, here underlines the fact that his creation has the same old instincts."
m/wallace_and_gromit_curse_of_the_wererabbit," Deliciously eccentric and witty ...with its deft humour and unique touches, [it] is an inspired adventure for every age"
m/walt_and_el_grupo," This historical film has to be seen for the glorious way it takes you back through time, making you feel as if you are part of Disney's entourage."
m/walt_before_mickey_2015," A dull script, flat performances and lighting that would embarrass a wedding photographer ruin a promising Walt pre-DISNEY story."
m/walter_2015, The shift from bright comedy to rather grim drama is gradual enough to carry the audience along...
m/waltz_with_bashir," It is an autobiographical quest, an immersion in memory and history that leaves a remarkable, lingering impression."
m/wanda," Wanda is rather out of step with the other, more famous, lovers-on-the-run films of its period."
m/wanda-sykes-ima-be-me," Wanda Sykes: I'ma Be Me is the funniest stand-up special in many a moon, an uproariously enjoyable performance by one of our most gifted and irreverent comediennes."
m/wanda_sykes_not_normal," In the end, though, when Sykes is her own Last Comic Standing, she turns her comedy lens back onto herself."
m/wanderlust_2011, Isolated chunks of awesome rather than a coherent whole.
m/wanted_dead_or_alive_1987, A bland and often lackluster action thriller with Rutger Hauer failing to hold a candle to McQueen...
m/war, The fatal flaw of War ... is that I don't give two craps about anyone in it.
m/war_dogs_2016," War Dogs is insufficient with these two characters (or maybe it's these two actors), who are neither hapless and schmucky enough to sustain laughs nor venal enough to get us rooting against them."
m/war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes," War for the Planet of the Apes is a stunning masterpiece. It's brutal, bleak and authentically moving."
m/war_horse," The project is tailor-made for Saving Private Ryan Spielberg, the war-story specialist, as well as for E.T. Spielberg, the chronicler of boyhood desires and yearnings for family."
m/war_inc, The John Cusack 'comedy' (generic term used loosely) gives anti-war filmmaking a bad name.
m/war_machine_2016," Not funny enough to be satire, not realistic enough to count as political commentary, not exciting enough to work as a war movie, David Michôd's supposedly Helleresque romp ... is an imperfect non-storm of unsuccess."
m/war_made_easy," War Made Easy is an engrossing bit of finger-pointing, ushering in another fascinating shade to the world's current woes, not to mention a devastating portrait of fallacy that grows stronger by the gunshot."
m/war_of_the_roses," It's to the credit of DeVito and his co-stars they they were willing to go that far, but maybe it shows more courage than wisdom."
m/war_of_the_worlds," Spielberg seems to have totally forgotten that he's a wuss, and plays this like the Holocaust and 9-11 combined."
m/war_on_everyone," War On Everyone is essentially a clothes hanger for smart one-liners, verbal and visual, and its success will depend partly on how folks like the look of the clothes hanger."
m/war_on_whistleblowers_free_press_and_the_national_security_state," At under an hour, the film, which also touches on White House-driven leaks for political gain, can't help but feel a bit incomplete."
m/war_requiem, The rhythm of the images attunes the viewer to the music's components.
m/war_room, An invaluable record of Bill Clinton's unlikely rise to the White House.
m/war_room_2015," I lodge no complaint against the film's emphasis on prayer, even if, dramatically, it's not scintillating stuff to watch."
m/war_story," Infuriatingly slow, enervating and basically empty contemplation of war's impact, and a waste of the formidable talent of a gallant Catherine Keener."
m/war_tapes," Mini-cams mounted on dashboards, gun turrets or helmets capture, with unsettling immediacy, the campaign's sudden explosions, chaotic ambushes and 24/7 sense of uncertainty."
m/war_witch," What's missing here, in order to raise it to a different status, is the fierce involvement that comes from someone who lives inside the picture and is therefore, personally concerned."
m/warcraft," It has plenty of faults, but Warcraft: The Beginning largely achieves what it sets out to do."
m/wargames," Classic techno-thriller. Despite the old hardware, the concepts still hold up today."
m/warlock, Richard E. Grant singlehandedly makes it worthwhile
m/warlords-2007," Laden with gritty action, but with an emotional undertow that carries the drama even through its weaker moments, pic reps a strong comeback by Hong Kong helmer-producer Peter Chan."
m/warm_bodies," ""Warm Bodies"" offers a welcome twist on the living-dead canon, even if the decidedly femme-skewed results ignore pretty much every rule of the genre."
m/warm_water_under_a_red_bridge, Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche.
m/warning_sign, Warning Sign fails to deliver any substantive messages or any genuine thrills.
m/warrior_king_2, Suffers badly from comparison to THE RAID. The inept JAWS 3D style FX don't help. A back-to-basics approach would have been much better.
m/warriors_of_heaven_and_earth, Impressively filmed but not dramatic enough to justify its length.
m/warriors_of_the_rainbow_seediq_bale," An ambitious, blood-soaked retelling of an uprising by Taiwanese natives against Japanese occupiers."
m/wasabi, Dawdles and drags when it should pop; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding.
m/washington_square," Painstakingly produced, dramatically compelling, and acted with skill and intensity."
m/wassup_rockers_2006, Larry Clark's latest finds the grizzled shock-meister in a thoughtful mode and a mellow mood.
m/waste-land, A joy to watch despite the abject poverty it contains.
m/wasted_on_the_young_2010," A very ambitious film, but not always a coherent one."
m/wasted_the_story_of_food_waste," Anthony Bourdain stars as narrator of this wake-up call: some forty percent of food that Americans buy is sent to landfills, contributing to a toxic environment."
m/watch_list, Not your typical drug film as it is filled with unique moments and some heartbreak.
m/watcher," The Watcher isn't that hard to watch, but you could find better things to do with your eyes."
m/watchers_of_the_sky, Edet Belzberg's sweeping survey of global genocide is an impressive and artful cinematic thesis of palpable substance.
m/watchmen," A huge budgeted superhero movie that delivers intellectually? That takes serious, ballsy chances with the form? Why, that sounds like a piece of art. A glorious, epic, exciting, mind blowing piece of art."
m/water, Here's yet another example of people confusing an honorable message with a good movie.
m/water_for_elephants," The film always seems to be on the cusp of locating some bigger truth about one's life and destiny, but this cinematic treatment loses its way by focusing almost solely on a sudsy, perfunctory love triangle."
m/water_horse," The star of this Scottish fable, about the mythical Loch Ness monster, looks like a raw chicken breast with teeth when he hatches."
m/waterboy, The type of film that must have been made for 8-year-olds.
m/waterland, A talented but terminally parched piece of literary cinema.
m/waterloo_bridge," Let there be no doubt about it. Vivien Leigh is as fine an actress as we have on the screen today. Maybe even the finest, and that's a lot to say."
m/watermark_2013, Watermark succeeds both as a rumination on our varied relationship with H2O and as a warning about the perils we'll face when we're down to the last few drops.
m/watership_down," Artful, pretty forgotten (and it should not be) animation of best seller."
m/waterworld," It's one of those marginal pictures you're not unhappy to have seen, but can't quite recommend."
m/wattstax," This gem of a concert documentary makes you realize how much of America's pop culture has been lost, ignored or left to rot since soul music's golden era three decades ago."
m/waves_2019," An incredibly empathetic film, but it never once manages to let our characters off the hook for their deeds, no matter how large or small."
m/way_down_east," What's amazing is that so much of Gish's tough, funny, intuitive performance, particularly in the film's middle section as she bears her illegitimate child, transcends time, place and technology."
m/way_home," like to think of the film as Local Hero for Kids, as the boy has to adapt from his urban kid lifestyle to the slow, simple ways of generations before. Will he do it? Will it work out? Can love overcome?"
m/way_of_the_gun, Feels like a peach-fuzz version of a genre that requires genuine grizzle.
m/way_we_were," An engrossing, if occasionally ludicrous, hit tearjerker with Pollack, Streisand, and Redford doing a good job of bringing Arthur Laurents' script to the screen."
m/wayne," I'm not into motorbikes, yet this documentary revved along in my mind in the days after I saw it."
m/waynes_world," Like the Bill & Ted movies, this one works on its intended level and then sneaks in excursions to some other levels, too."
m/waynes_world_2," Self-referential though it may be, WW2 is so packed with intelligent and occasionally surreal comic moments, you altogether manage to forget it's a sequel to a movie that was based on a skit in the first place."
m/ways_to_live_forever, The overarching sentiment of Ways to Live Forever is curiosity. Does dying hurt? How does someone live forever?
m/we_2011," No matter her audacity, the Material Girl is only as good as her material, and Madonna has only half a movie here."
m/we_are_little_zombies," A rainbow-colored scream into the abyss, Nagahisa's story of a quartet of orphaned tweens who start a chiptune rock band is as rigorous in its exploration of grief as it is stylistically exuberant..."
m/we_are_marshall," ""Grief is messy,"" says McShane's anguished dad. We Are Marshall's disingenuously tidy portrait of it, alas, is not."
m/we_are_still_here, The lumbering ghouls are a bit too hokey to be taken seriously as objects of terror. But they fit into a general thematic and design scheme that faithfully echoes a seminal era's often garish horror convention
m/we_are_the_best," WE ARE THE BEST! charts this troubled yet exhilarating period of transformation in a trio of 12-year-old girls, while milking the social and historical particularities of the setting - Sweden, 1982 - for all their nostalgic worth."
m/we_are_the_heat," Like the marimba-infused dance-floor beats that permeate its soundtrack, this Colombian thriller lacks narrative substance behind its nonstop energy and pulsating rhythm."
m/we_are_the_night, The first half-hour boasts real energy and finds new ways to explore elements of the vampire genre. Until the time continued to pass and it slowly dawned that most of its ideas were circa 1987.
m/we_are_together_the_children_of_agape_choir," While it strays occasionally into Oxfam-advert territory, this remains a touching documentary."
m/we_are_twisted_fing_sister," The deep dive into the origin story is an illuminating breakdown of how [TS] succeeded in the rock business, amassing a cult following while rocking every bar and tavern on the suburban circuit throughout Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut."
m/we_are_what_we_are_2013, We Are What We Are is a re-make that succeeds superbly while remaining true to the strange and sad intimately grotesque spirit of the original.
m/we_are_wizards, A better approach would have been one that focused less on a child's home movies and performances and more on why he's on stage singing about an imaginary wizard.
m/we_are_x_2016," We Are X is a sometimes thrilling, not too terribly deep portrait of a band who perform the role of rock n roll messiah about as well as humanly possible. By the end, don't be surprised if you are converted."
m/we_are_your_friends_2015," ""Proves to be a film with mood to spare but nothing much to say."""
m/we_believe_in_dinosaurs," Though entertaining and far from being a Biblical disaster, Dinosaurs spreads itself so thin that the doc loses its grip on the basics of storytelling."
m/we_bought_a_zoo," If Crowe's films radiate one thing, it's kindness, which is something not a lot of filmmakers can claim."
m/we_come_as_friends," In the new ""scramble for Africa"", the Africans are losers once again. The hypocrisy of Christian missionaries and UN officials are exposed by allowing them to hoist themselves on their own petards. A brilliant documentary for the ages."
m/we_dont_live_here_anymore," Failing to find the cinematic equivalent of Dubus's vertical writing, Curran and Gross's movie strains for truths it never earns."
m/we_go_on," To fully appreciate We Go On, you have to kind of surrender to it. To fall into it and let the talented directors simply guide you through their carefully controlled landscape."
m/we_have_a_pope, The big problem with Habemus Papum is that Piccoli (historically a wonderful and charming performer) just looks shell-shocked every minute. There's no texture to the performance.
m/we_need_to_talk_about_kevin," Without Swinton, often seen in close-up, the film might have sunk without trace under the weight of its morbid subject matter. But she is pitch perfect throughout, restrained but still forceful."
m/we_own_the_night, An old school character-driven police drama that comes from the heart of a filmmaker who's clearly in complete sync with his cast and crew.
m/we_steal_secrets_the_story_of_wikileaks_2013," You'll leave knowing slightly more about the who, what and why of WikiLeaks; you'll also wish the whole shebang didn't fell like such a tone-deaf data dump overall."
m/we_summon_the_darkness," steadily upends conventional prejudices (& cinematic clichés) concerning gender, class and religion - even if, after a relatively early reveal of the Big Twist, there is nowhere left to go beyond standard cat-and-mouse manoeuvres and chaotic farce."
m/we_the_animals, A complicated coming-of-age tale that not only brings refreshing insights but gives us beautifully rendered images that have the power to haunt you for days.
m/we_the_parents," We the Parents is a must-see civics lesson, an example of the power of grassroots organizing, of having a good lawyer, and of how seemingly small ideas can make big waves."
m/we_the_party_2012," Van Peebles's heart is probably in the right place, but his attempt to wed his kids' generational moment to a classic coming-of-age template falters in its message-obsessed execution."
m/we_the_people_the_market_basket_effect," Combining court documents, footage of the protests, and interviews with reverent personnel, reporters, and politicians, Reid's fast-paced and engaging film appears to play out as a simple question-and-answer exercise."
m/we_were_here_voices_from_the_aids_years_in_san_francisco," We Were Here documents the epidemic through a powerful combination of first-hand testimony, archival photography and TV news footage."
m/we_were_soldiers," Informative and thoughtful, presenting a pivotal battle with clarity and all of the people in the middle of it with reverence."
m/weather_man, The Weather Man is what indie misery looks like when re-created by one of Hollywood's big studios.
m/web_junkie, The film is less interested in exploring the questionable science behind the program's practice. It is also uninterested in challenging allegations that the boys are disconnected from reality.
m/wedding_banquet," This is an enjoyable film, though perhaps not as good as word-of-mouth would have it."
m/wedding_crashers," Wedding Crashers' real secret is that despite flashes of nudity, crudity and mockery of women's raging hormones at the first sight of a trousseau, at its core it's just a big pushover with the heart of a chick flick."
m/wedding_date," There's no cliché from any romantic comedy of the past twenty years that this movie isn't afraid to borrow, water down, and then recycle."
m/wedding_palace_2011," The genre elements of the romantic comedy ""Wedding Palace"" attempt a transpacific transit, but get lost in translation."
m/wedding_planner, An inane romantic comedy that makes you wonder if the Writers Guild hasn't already gone on strike.
m/wedding_singer," This movie is sickeningly sweet, and only a die-hard romantic or an avowed Adam Sandler fan will be able to sit through the ninety-five minute feature without going into sugar shock."
m/weekend_2011," The two leading actors give deft, expressive performances that have us rooting for both of them. Cullen has a broodingly sensual presence, while the impish New makes a charmingly prickly foil."
m/weekend_at_bernies, Bizarre and campy. And what's funnier than sight gags involving dead bodies waterskiing?
m/weekend_of_a_champion_2013," Weekend of a Champion begins as a motorsports movie but ends up a portrait of two wily elder statesmen who have survived into their seventies by skill, stealth and sheer luck."
m/weight_of_water, Slicked-up jazzy lit-porn: all nice-looking people in various stages of excitement in the room coming and going and talking of Michelangelo.
m/weiner, This spellbinder about a politician in free fall would be hilarious if it weren't so agonizingly true.
m/weirdsville," A cleverly constructed, capably crafted and often uproarious shaggy-dog black comedy."
m/welcome-to-dongmakgol, Korea's answer to Shangri-la is well worth a visit.
m/welcome_home_2018," Although it tries to be a nail-biting enterprise, I doubt anything here will make deal-hunters second guess an impossible rate for an unforgettable vacation. The extra sleaze just might be worth the savings."
m/welcome_home_roscoe_jenkins," If you thought National Lampoon's Vacation films were at least okay, then Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins is a decent enough way to spend two hours."
m/welcome_home_roxy_carmichael," There's enough material here for several movies, but none of them turns into this one."
m/welcome_to_collinwood," The off-center humor is a constant, and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery."
m/welcome_to_curiosity," The dialogue is awful, the characters are paper-thin, the acting is atrocious and the pacing laborious."
m/welcome_to_happiness," Bad movies are a dime a dozen, but the truly pitiable ones are few and far between. Oliver Thompson's debut is spellbindingly awful, but most of it is touched with a guilelessness that makes it difficult to hate."
m/welcome_to_marwen," Welcome to Marwen is a decidedly offbeat story of trauma and redemption. We all find ways to cope with our pain. Art, and movies, are a way."
m/welcome_to_me, ...it's hard to deny that the actress sporadically delivers a far more raw and naked performance than one has come to expect.
m/welcome_to_mercy, An intelligent and unsettling picture that sucks you in.
m/welcome_to_mooseport, A bit of political fluff several rungs below 'Dave' on the sharpness scale...a hundred minute dead spot punctuated by very occasional moments of feeble humor.
m/welcome_to_new_york_2015, I watched the whole thing with my jaw on the floor.
m/welcome_to_sarajevo, Too often we sense that the actors are drifting and the story is at sea.
m/welcome_to_the_dollhouse," Searing story of adolescent anguish, almost unbearably painful."
m/welcome_to_the_jungle_2013," Welcome To The Jungle strands audiences on a deserted island without food, shelter, or any real form of entertainment - a fate not even action-star-turned-comedian Jean-Claude Van Damme can save us from."
m/welcome_to_the_punch, That Creevy has talent isn't in question; whether this substanceless stuff is the best outlet for it is another matter.
m/welcome_to_the_rileys," The sluggish pace serves to spotlight poignant scenes, but mostly feels as if the Rileys' family tragedy has left their 30-year marriage in a state of suspended animation."
m/welcome_to_the_sticks," Welcome to the Sticks is the most successful movie ever released in France, possibly because self-deprecating humour is so rare there."
m/well_never_have_paris_2014," Helberg is venturing into Woody Allen territory with the picture, and he's a lot like Allen, - the sense of humor, comedic timing, likability, masculinity, and directorial skill."
m/wendigo," [Fessenden] weaves a creepy spell by crafting a kaleidoscope of puppetry, sounds and cinema legerdemain."
m/wendy_and_lucy," Decency is heartbreakingly trampled by strict, hard-nosed, boot-straps logic and the kind of hippie freedom nostalgia of movies like Easy Rider is quietly blown away like dust."
m/went_the_day_well," To look down on the blatant propagandizing of Went the Day Well? is pointless insofar as it disallows the possibility of learning from it, but it's nevertheless difficult to not take certain elements of the film with a grain of salt."
m/were_back_a_dinosaurs_story," If creating a non-offensive movie filled with sweet dinosaurs who have had a lot of time on their hands and not much to do is a measure of success, then the movie accomplishes what it set out to do."
m/were_the_millers," The kind of laugh till it hurts, spit-take funny, doubling over in your seat comedy that lesser films can only aspire to."
m/were_the_world_mine," Were the World Mine, an indie alternative to Disney's High School Musical franchise, is a small, endearing film."
m/werewolf_of_london," For my money, Werewolf of London remains the best werewolf picture of all time."
m/wes_craven_presents_dracula_iii_legacy_2004," At least in the cinematic morass that is modern movies, ""Dracula III"" is better than the wimpy vampire lore pioneered by Anne Rice."
m/wes_cravens_new_nightmare, The new film recaptures the dark soul of the original through a clever conceit.
m/west_of_memphis, An intentionally staggering encapsulation of the West Memphis 3 Case.
m/west_side_story, Demonstrates yet again the enduring quality of Shakespeare's work.
m/western_2018, The film's visual execution and spare narrative style give it a timeless dimension that will lend some modestly exportable clout to an approachable and appealingly laconic drama.
m/westfront_1918_1930," In his first talkie, G.W. Pabst plunks down in the winding trenches for a grunt's view of dirt and shrapnel"
m/westworld, Less spectacular but more cogent than later 'virtual reality' fantasies such as Total Recall and The Truman Show.
m/wet_hot_american_summer, First elicits chuckles ... then belly laughs as the action expands.
m/wetlands_2017," ""Wetlands"" attempts to turn Atlantic City in December into a noir nexus of drug-dealing surfers, struggling moms and broken cops, but instead merely claims a handful of good actors as unfortunate victims."
m/whale_rider, A contemporary version of an aboriginal legend from New Zealand that should delight audiences of all ages.
m/whaledreamers, The September 11 segment is one of the clumsiest works of montage you're likely to see.
m/whales_of_august, A worthy film that affords the viewer a rare chance to see some fine acting by stars the like we'll not see again.
m/what_a_girl_wants," It's slick girlie stuff, but the cast makes it go down easy."
m/what_a_way_to_go," J. Lee Thompson's direction has failed to coalesce a good, firm farce. It lets the whole thing flap wildly -- and that's no way to make a film."
m/what_about_bob," There's no question that the engaging performances of Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss manage to breathe a great deal of life into the proceedings, and before it starts to run out of steam toward the end, the film provides an awful lot of laughs."
m/what_alice_found," The screenplay by director Bell is packed with surprises, and the acting is excellent."
m/what_did_you_do_in_the_war_daddy, The entire movie would have benefited from trimming a half hour from it.
m/what_doesnt_kill_you," Mark Ruffalo's performance walks a narrow line, making you root for the screw up loser who has already been given too many chances."
m/what_dreams_may_come, A heaping serving of metaphysical gobbledygook wrapped in a physically striking package.
m/what_ever_happened_to_baby_jane, It's a film that's a little slow to start and could benefit from a faster pace. But this is still essential viewing with the superb Davis in legend mode and Crawford wisely under-playing her role as the victim.
m/what_happened_miss_simone_2015, A most satisfying rendering of a complex cultural legacy ...
m/what_happened_to_monday," The star is up for the challenge, but the high concept quickly unravels."
m/what_happened_was," This intense, mysterious drama about a date between two lonely misfits, is sensitively directed by Tom Noonan, better known as an actor; it was the surprise winner of the Grand Jury Prize of the 1994 Sundance Film Festival."
m/what_have_i_done_to_deserve_this, When Almodóvar attempts a plot the film becomes tedious.
m/what_if_2010, Predictable faith-based movie is heavy-handed and trite.
m/what_if_2014, Elevated from an above-average romantic comedy to a movie worthy of being embraced by a generation of twenty somethings because it refuses to let its characters off the hook.
m/what_just_happened, A desultory Hollywood satire that fatally lacks the guts or verve to say anything vitally new or different.
m/what_keeps_you_alive," This is a solid genre exercise, as most of Minihan's films have been, and the kind of thing you're likely to catch late at night on Shudder and wonder why more people didn't tell you about it before."
m/what_lies_beneath, What Lies Beneath is startlingly shallow even for a summer movie.
m/what_lies_upstream, A sobering expose' issuing a dire warning about the whole damn nation's being on the brink of ecological collapse!
m/what_maisie_knew_2012," The film's simple strategy of filming always from Maisie's height whenever she is present works amazingly well, an object lesson in how point of view can be what matters most."
m/what_men_want_2019," Although the comedy carries the movie, at the heart of it is the surprising message about the burdens placed on women in male-dominated areas."
m/what_our_fathers_did_a_nazi_legacy, British human rights lawyer Philippe Sands' interviews with two sons of senior Nazi officials make for a chilling study in contrasts ...
m/what_richard_did, What Richard Did inevitably does reach a point at which the uneventfulness starts to become a little oppressive...
m/what_she_said_the_art_of_pauline_kael, An exquisitely crafted documentary about the woman who was arguably the greatest movie critic who ever lived...
m/what_still_remains, What Still Remains therefore moves beyond social commentary into the realm of entitlement by divinity.
m/what_the__do_we_know," If you've had your fill of formula fare, you may want to try What the #$*! Do We Know!?."
m/what_they_had," While highly personal for first-time director Elizabeth Chomko, What They Had is a universal story of love and loss."
m/what_to_expect_when_youre_expecting," Nobody's waddling into this theater by accident. You need to walk into this theater expecting to see a bunch of babies, some pregnant chicks, a bunch of clueless dudes and when you do that, you kind of have fun because it's not a bad movie."
m/what_we_did_on_our_holiday," Engaging family comedy What We Did on Our Holiday sees the creators of Outnumbered repeating the BBC sitcom's winning mix of beleaguered parents, cute scene-stealing kids and spot-on observational humour with audience-pleasing results."
m/what_we_do_in_the_shadows, Does for vampires what This is Spinal Tap did for rock bands.
m/what_we_do_is_secret, What We Do Is Secret should be kept as anything but a secret.
m/what_we_found, The quality of the film seems to replicate that roller coaster reality. Often it is engaging then the next moment it is a little flat with some uneven acting.
m/what_women_want," As one-joke premises go, this isn't a bad one, but it's been rather clumsily elaborated ... and slackly directed."
m/what_you_gonna_do_when_the_worlds_on_fire," Although sometimes it becomes monotonous and somewhat repetitive, Minervini uses these deficiencies to reinforce the discourse of ethnic minorities to counteract the effects of a powerful media and political apparatus. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/whatever_works," Larry David makes a terrific alter-ego for Woody Allen in this familiar farce, advocating a non-judgmental attitude about the diverse choices people make to find happiness."
m/whats_cooking," It will not only make your mouth water at four extraordinary meals, but also will bring smiles and chuckles."
m/whats_eating_gilbert_grape," It's expertly handled, well-written material that knows and understands its many different characters. There are moments in this film that cover the entire emotional spectrum, and not a second is wasted on insincere emotion, making it a real winner."
m/whats_in_a_name_2013," A little joke becomes the catalyst for the unravelling of relationships in this jocular French comedy in which egos, political beliefs, sexual orientations and trusts are thrust like daggers"
m/whats_love_got_to_do_with_it, The perfect combination of stellar turns and sensational music
m/whats_new_pussycat," Clive Donner's stylish direction harmonizes well with Woody Allen's inspired screenplay to yield an elegant entertainment, proving once again that Allen is a better scenarist than a director."
m/whats_the_matter_with_kansas," Every single person in this film is seen as themselves, is allowed to speak and seems to have a good heart. I've rarely seen a documentary quite like it. It has a point to make but no ax to grind."
m/whats_the_worst_that_could_happen, Struggles to keep one amused as the premise tries to work in kooky supporting players with fitful success.
m/whats_up_doc," Hilarious live cartoon directed by Bogdanovich with sexy, silly turn by Streisand, and equally funny O'Neal and Kahn."
m/whats_your_number," Some audience members will come out for What's Your Number? for Faris' appeal and likability, but they'll leave disappointed because this film is more interested in showing her physical assets than her comedic ones."
m/wheelman, Frank Grillo shines in this minimalist take on the crime film genre.
m/when_a_man_loves_a_woman," Exceptional tale of a family in crisis; cursing, alcoholism."
m/when_a_stranger_calls," Heavy duty horror fans will not be willing to pay this phone bill, but the core audience for this PG-13 thriller will more than likely take the Stranger's call this weekend."
m/when_a_stranger_calls_back," The telefilm is a good rattler, despite some logic dropouts."
m/when_comedy_went_to_school, A humorous look at Borscht Belt comedians during the Golden Age of American Comedy.
m/when_did_you_last_see_your_father, Morrison's book is painfully honest and whilst the film is sensitively handled and impeccably crafted it is also curiously distant and unmoving.
m/when_harry_met_sally," When Harry Met Sally... is a sweet, embraceable comedy, a moonstruck Manhattan romance that, like a Gershwin tune, turns the sighs and glances, the spats and reconciliations, all the cliches of the heart into infectious melody."
m/when_harry_tries_to_marry, Inspires little more than eye-rolling and impatient finger-tapping.
m/when_i_saw_you," Here's a story of refugee life from the perspective of a brash and attentive kid, one just discovering - and often rejecting - the political realities grown-ups accept."
m/when_i_walk_2013," WHEN I WALK had every opportunity to be a depressing exercise in self-indulgence. But it benefits from DaSilva's courage, cheer and unflinching honesty."
m/when_in_rome, An exceptionally strong cast makes this fantasy romantic comedy trifle pleasantly watchable despite its chick-lit conventions.
m/when_marnie_was_there," Taken as the punctuation mark on Studio Ghibli's oeuvre, it's underwhelming. Taken on its own terms, it's ... still underwhelming, but significantly less so."
m/when_night_is_falling," Rozema is a fabulist with a strong visual sense, and she creates a distinctive, enclosed world to illustrate Camille's odyssey."
m/when_the_bough_breaks_2016," While empathy is first to go in the tasteless When the Bough Breaks, there is nothing good in its place."
m/when_the_dragon_swallowed_the_sun," Much of what people say here is maddeningly phased out in favour of oozingly self-righteous music by Philip Glass, precisely what Tibet does not need: an arty score."
m/when_the_game_stands_tall," This dreary assemblage of every possible sports cliché has one thing in common with the game it portrays. Every time it seems to be going somewhere, it stops."
m/when_the_levees_broke," What breaks your heart is the film's accumulated firsthand stories of New Orleans residents who lost everything in the flood after Hurricane Katrina, and the dismaying conclusion that a year after the disaster, the broken city has been largely abandoned."
m/when_we_first_met, The potentially problematic premise is narrowly sidestepped because the film zigs when you expect it to zag... This watered-down rom-com doesn't fully deliver but it's a diverting twist on the genre nonetheless.
m/when_will_i_be_loved, An hour's worth of story with 20 minutes of filler tacked on at the beginning.
m/when_worlds_collide," Never mind plot logic, don't think too hard about the 'sci' component of the sci-fi, and certainly keep the unsubtle sociology and Pal's typical Bible-based gloss in perspective. When Worlds Collide remains entertaining and satisfying...."
m/when_youre_strange, Writer/director Tom DiCillo takes a dip into documentary to tell us just what The Doors mean to him in a project that's the film equivalent of a fanzine...
m/where_do_we_go_now," A hugely entertaining and frequently hilarious comedy with a witty script, inventive direction, a handful of enjoyable musical numbers and terrific comic performances from a superb ensemble cast."
m/where_eagles_dare, You have to admire any film that casts Clint Eastwood opposite Richard Burton; the real violence is in the clash of acting styles.
m/where_god_left_his_shoes," This story opens our eyes to the sub-world of heart-breaking homeless shelters, showing the main holiday season as the busiest time."
m/where_hands_touch," when Asante gets under the skin, it isn't only to infuriate, but to find the connective tissue between us all, beautifully hopeful in illustrating that no matter how deep ignorance and hatred run, a shared humanity runs a little deeper."
m/where_hope_grows," Like most if not all faith-based entertainments, ""Where Hope Grows"" embraces the idea that God works in mysterious ways. But it also insists that God helps only those who help themselves."
m/where_in_the_world_is_osama_bin_laden, Dependent on a gimmick which is feels like a death sentence Spurlock spends the entire movie trying to dodge.
m/where_is_kyra," A shattering portrait of a luckless woman unable to pull out of the tailspin that is her life, ""Where Is Kyra?"" is a powerfully moody character study anchored by a remarkable performance from Michelle Pfeiffer."
m/where_the_buffalo_roam," The two charismatic leads prevent this from failing entirely, but the tone is shallow and insincere, largely because Linson wants to do what Thompson never would, which is to please all of the people all of the time."
m/where_the_green_ants_dream," As a conventional narrative, it's extremely simple and fairly slapdash, but it's never simple-minded, being too full of moments of inspired craziness and wisdom."
m/where_the_money_is, The film feels much more like a made-for-TV movie than a vehicle for one of Hollywood's formerly bankable stars.
m/where_the_sidewalk_ends, A weatherbeaten Andrews gives one of his finest performances.
m/where_the_truth_lies," A cool change for Egoyan that doesn't necessarily work on every level, but one that offers a number of successful elements..."
m/where_the_wild_things_are," The emotions at the core of each scene are sincere, and invariably true to the source."
m/where_to_invade_next," A feature-length infomercial for socialism with Moore the more playfully funny mode of his classic ""Bowling for Columbine'' and ""Roger & Me.''"
m/whered_you_go_bernadette, Richard Linklater's adaptation of Maria Semple's novel is a critical (if characteristically humane) assessment of American society in spiritual crisis.
m/wheres_daddy," An important examination of how Black Men are treated regarding child support by the courts. It will make you think, talk & possibly take action to even the playing field. No child should have to ask Where's Daddy?"
m/wheres_marlowe, If it had a livelier pace and more believable acting by secondary characters ... Where's Marlowe? would be a big treat for audiences seeking a hip comedy.
m/wheres_my_roy_cohn," As a portrait of Cohn, the documentary is riveting."
m/which_way_home_2009, Investigates illegal immigration and child labor in a very human way. We ride freight trains with teenagers trying to get to the US for a better life. Exceptionally effective verite filmmaking from Rebecca Cammisa.
m/which_way_is_the_front_line_from_here_the_life_and_times_of_tim_hetherington," The film is more powerful and haunting thanks to the ample footage incorporated of Hetherington himself, a cheerful soul even when faced with evidence of unimaginable cruelty, such as photographing those blinded during the war in Liberia."
m/while_she_was_out, Imagine a Lifetime revenge-themed movie of the week intercut with a few death scenes from the cutting room floor of a Final Destination flick.
m/while_were_young, Baumbach is never less than shrewd in the way he links his protagonists through insecurity.
m/while_you_were_sleeping, A perfect example of this unoriginal-but-enjoyable type of film making.
m/whip_it," Barrymore has made a highly promising debut behind the camera and created a first-rate, funny, heart-filled and totally winning entertainment that not only rolls, it rocks."
m/whiplash_2014," Even if Whiplash falters from time to time, the performances never do."
m/whipped," All in all, an interesting spin on the conquests of 'dating.'"
m/whirlpool," A daft premise does little to detract from the enjoyment of this tense, well-made murder mystery."
m/whiskey_tango_foxtrot," It's wiser than the confusion its title suggests, and it pushes Fey toward a film career that's as uncompromising, unpredictable and intelligent as her TV work."
m/whisky," Whisky es la confirmacin de que el cine uruguayo puede dejar de soar en hacer, algn da, una gran pelcula, porque ya la ha hecho."
m/whisky_galore_2017," There's a place in the world for gentle comedies, and a place in most people's hearts for good whisky. This may not be the best you've ever tasted, but it'll warm your cockles."
m/whisper-of-the-heart," Sweet and well-observed, Whisper is about self-discovery and little else"
m/white-nights," White Nights is made by people who seem much more comfortable with dance than with the requirements of the Hollywood thriller. It comes to life in the dance sequences, and then drifts away again."
m/white-wedding," White Wedding is about connections, and it has the good sense to pull them together in a film that's sweet, inclusive and sunny."
m/white_bird_in_a_blizzard," White Bird in a Blizzard is worth seeing for Eva Green's performance alone, and to experience the dreamlike quality of Gregg Araki's individual, highly unique vision of cinema."
m/white_boy_rick, Compelling if familiar... Ultimately the story of a desperately poor family striving to stay together despite the circumstances.
m/white_chicks," It takes a premise that is unworkable to begin with, stretches it so far that no one will buy it, and then utilizes only the stalest and most obvious jokes anyway."
m/white_countess, Enacted by stuffy actors so great at what they do that it's terrifically boring to watch them do it.
m/white_dog," There is no excitement to these scenes -- which is as it should be. The filming is sparse, with no clutter."
m/white_fang_2018," ""White Fang"" doesn't infantilize the animals, their struggle for survival, or the evils of humanity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
m/white_fang_2_myth_of_the_white_wolf, Fine family entertainment and crosscultural tale of Haida Indian spirituality
m/white_god, A sort of apocalyptic fable in which the maltreatment of lowly animals becomes a potent metaphor for everything from immigration to the abuse of power ...
m/white_heat," Cagney is a force of nature in this movie, alternately frightening and pathetic."
m/white_house_down," The film really was a lot funnier than I expected, but that's not enough to stop it from being just another big, dumb action flick."
m/white_hunter_black_heart," (Eastwood's) performance, whether it is based on Huston or not, dominates everything on screen"
m/white_irish_drinkers," Couching clichs in self-conscious nostalgia does nothing to lessen their corniness in White Irish Drinkers, a coming-of-age saga notable only for its staleness."
m/white_light_black_rain, A stirring and heart-wrenching statement of the horrible powers that mankind holds in its fist.
m/white_lightnin," Seething with blighted fervour and over-ripe with religious wrath, the wild, elemental imagery generates something truly disturbing. With its strange religious overtones and inevitably fitful conclusion, White Lightnin' is elusive and bleak."
m/white_material," A mesmerising portrait of civil war, racial tension and one woman's resistance to change in an unnamed, French-speaking African country."
m/white_men_cant_jump, A hilarious white-black buddy comedy that manages to not feel completely contrived. Snipes is excellent.
m/white_noise," fails miserably to frighten, enlighten, or entertain"
m/white_noise_2," White Noise 2 is pretty much everything the original film wasn't: genuinely exciting, well made, competently acted, and contains a payoff that remains in the realm of easy digestion."
m/white_oleander, Eschews easy sentimentality and presents the women as complex individuals.
m/white_rabbit, All too much of Tim McCann's drama about this disturbed loner comes to feel like a checklist of warning signs.
m/white_rabbit_2018," Wein keeps things loose and although the clearly improvisational nature of some scenes gives the film some rough edges, ""White Rabbit"" benefits from handling its heavier ideas about identity politics and what constitutes art with a light touch."
m/white_ribbon, Immaculately crafted in beautiful black-and-white and entirely absorbing through its longish running time.
m/white_sands, An intriguing mystery with good performances and a crisp style.
m/white_squall," The script is slow and tired. We've seen it all before, and the change of setting has little impact."
m/white_stripes_under_great_white_northern_lights, Both film and band really come alive when the White Stripes get onstage.
m/white_zombie," It's Bela. It's a classic. Unfortunately, it's also a dreadful little flick."
m/whiteboyz," Many of the characters are neglected, even though most are not of much importance, but that's because Hoch and company don't take any time to add the correct amount of realism to it."
m/whitey_united_states_of_america_v_james_j_bulger," Berlinger needs to give his heavy-metal backdrop music a rest, but this is still one of his most ambitious films, vibrating with the same municipal unease as Chinatown."
m/whitney_2018, Many of us missed Whitney even before she left; this imperfect documentary preys calmly and effectively on that longing.
m/who-killed-nancy, Parker's film feels clouded by his obvious posthumous adoration of the enigmatic Sid. His witnesses are less than credible and his argument feels fumbled.
m/who_am_i, One of Jackie Chan's best. A compelling mystery plot and some of the greatest action he's ever done. The rooftop fight is brilliant.
m/who_framed_roger_rabbit," Not only a technical tour de force, it crackles with entertainment."
m/who_is_dayani_cristal_2013," As informative, revealing, and occasionally poignant as some of the unearthed revelations are, the doc is ultimately hampered by a level of self-congratulation that nearly undoes its effectiveness as an activist polemic."
m/who_is_harry_nilsson, ...does something that few such films accomplish: it allows the audience to feel as though they have walked a mile in a man's shoes.
m/who_killed_the_electric_car, A left-leaning documentary that effectively shows how big biz trashed a pollution-free car.
m/who_the_and_is_jackson_pollock," While the forensics is marginally interesting, the most arresting piece of the film is Horton herself, as she asks of the art world, 'Who the hell do they think they are?'"
m/who_would_you_take_to_a_deserted_island, You'll like the talented cast. I'm not sure you'll care enough about what happens to their characters.
m/whole_nine_yards," The infrequent laughs are forced, and the movie feels as stale as a month-old focaccia."
m/whole_ten_yards, Here's another major-studio comedy that makes you want to apply for frequent-misery mileage.
m/whole_wide_world," Invest some patience and you'll be richly rewarded with rolling frontier vistas, butterscotch sunsets and a sweet, melancholy romance that will sneak up on you and grab your heart."
m/wholl_stop_the_rain," Anchored by great turns from Moriarty, Nolte and Tuesday Weld, Reisz version of Stone's book is one of the most intriguing films about Vietnam, at once a tale about a paricularly divisive war and a parable about moral chaos and personal disintegration."
m/wholly_moses," The movie's not funny on its own, and since movie audiences are scarcely going to be shocked by its mild but relentlessly repetitive irreverence, it all boils down to a very old joke."
m/whores_glory_2011, To combine stories of exploited Third World women with feisty songs by female Anglo-American rockers is to flirt with glamorization.
m/whos_afraid_of_virginia_woolf," Keen adaptation and handsome production by Ernest Lehman, outstanding direction by Mike Nichols in his feature debut, and four topflight performances score an artistic bullseye."
m/whos_camus_anyway," Energy and comedy are in large supply in writer-director Mitsuo Yanagimachi's Who's Camus Anyway?, yet another riff on the levels of reality that occur when a cast and crew make a movie."
m/whos_driving_doug, The road-trip drama Who's Driving Doug is earnest but not overly sweet - a blessing for a film with built-in sentimentality traps.
m/whos_that_girl," 'Who's That Girl' is so eager to please, it ends up being a very hard movie to hate. Sure, it's formulaic and overcooked, but it's ultimately a pretty typical '80s comedy, no better or worse than average."
m/whos_that_knocking_at_my_door," Who's That Knocking at My Door is simply (and finally) unable to wholeheartedly establish itself as more than just a run-of-the-mill, far-from-accomplished student film."
m/whos_your_caddy, A summer movie trifle that's somehow shamelessly derivative and genuinely amusing at the same time.
m/why_did_i_get_married," Stiffly written, didactic, and whiplash-inducing in its tonal shifts."
m/why_did_i_get_married_too," Since Married Too? is not Perry's first attempt at filmmaking, his reliance on formula becomes disconcerting. In fact, since the execrable Meet the Browns, Perry's conventions have been unacceptable."
m/why_do_fools_fall_in_love, The musical numbers are outstanding! Mr. Tate turns Frankie's showmanship into an expression of bold kinetic energy!
m/why_dont_you_just_die," Why Don't You Just Die! is a smartly constructed and blisteringly paced bit of chaos that is impressive to watch, even for those susceptible to queasiness at the sight of blood."
m/why_dont_you_play_in_hell," A love letter to cinema, paired with an oddly moving family story and framed by a yakuza tale, Sono's latest is wild, unruly, and hugely entertaining, whether you're looking for a grand artistic vision, emotional resonance, or just two hours of fun."
m/why_him," The results are particularly cringe-worthy since they so frequently waste the talents of James Franco and Bryan Cranston, here forced to inhabit lazy generational stereotypes that never resemble legitimate human beings."
m/why_stop_now," Nothing-script, performances, comedy, drama-works in the slightest."
m/wichita, Jacques Tourneur's first and best film in CinemaScope is also one of his strangest westerns.
m/wicked_little_things," It is a fun undead romp with very attractive girls, creepy kids, and a good amount of the ole dark and chunky. If that's all you want out of it, you won't be disappointed."
m/wicker_park, ...impressed me enough to want to recommend the film to anyone who...
m/wide_awake_2006, A fascinatingly self-indulgent look at one man's battle with insomnia.
m/widow_of_st_pierre," Leconte creates a seductive other world, a screen rarity indeed."
m/widows_2018," It might not reach the heights of his previous three features, but the mad artistry McQueen brings to this film is something that is vastly missing in mainstream moviemaking."
m/widows_peak," Widow's Peak is another of those sly, witty, quietly ribald comedies that have been coming out of Ireland in the last few years."
m/wiener_dog," [Sundance 2016] An alternately tender, blunt and acridly satiric meditation on the process of life and death in all its natural, bitter forms."
m/wilby_wonderful, Writer/director Daniel MacIvor does a wonderful job of establishing this small town...
m/wild_2014, Witherspoon's Wild is tame enough to maybe actually give her a second act to her career.
m/wild_america," Supposedly, Wild America is a family film, but I can't figure out which members of the family it's intended for."
m/wild_angels," Roger Corman's The Wild Angels took the outlaw culture of the biker movie into nervy, nihilistic territory."
m/wild_bill," The characters are interesting as caricature, but not as real people. There is no one in the show that the audience cares whether they live or die."
m/wild_bill_2011," Why can't all British crime dramas be so well written and well acted, and have a splash of comedy as confident as this?"
m/wild_city_2015," Fans will be thrilled that the auteur hasn't missed a beat with ""Wild City,"" although he appears to be making the same concessions to the Chinese market as his contemporaries."
m/wild_combination_a_portrait_of_arthur_russell, It's the perfect image for a man whose vivid music appeared to be fighting its way into sharper focus.
m/wild_hearts_cant_be_broken, Girl-and-her-horse story with some peril might inspire kids.
m/wild_hogs," This shallow comedy imagines itself as an amalgam of St. Elmo's Fire, The Wild Bunch, and Deliverance."
m/wild_horse_wild_ride_2011, This gorgeous-looking documentary is crying out to be remade as a family film feature.
m/wild_horses_2015," Tonally dissonant and narratively disjointed, ""Wild Horses"" plays like a patchwork quilt of scenes excerpted from a much longer movie, or maybe even a miniseries."
m/wild_in_the_country," A script that looked good on paper but when it came time to produce it, things came apart more than they came together."
m/wild_man_blues," Whatever one thinks about Woody Allen, you'll probably find it in here, except why Americans don't much turn out to see his movies."
m/wild_one, This Stanley Kramer-produced film is the original biker movie.
m/wild_parrots_of_telegraph_hill," The gentle, G-rated documentary The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill records the sort of story that used to simply pass into urban legend."
m/wild_river, One of [Kazan's] least theatrical and most affecting films.
m/wild_rose_2019," Entirely delightful, fresh as a Scottish summer evening."
m/wild_rovers_1971, Marvellous performances and elegiac photography (by Philip Lathrop) are well complemented by Edwards' unusually light touch.
m/wild_strawberries," Presumably, the audience is stunned that it can understand the filmic metaphors... and thus, they must be genius."
m/wild_style," Shot independently, this film captures a movement in its genesis."
m/wild_tales," If you don't see a part of yourself in some of these stories, I suspect you are living in La Denegacion."
m/wild_target," Nothing feels like it's been properly thought through, highlighted by the fact that Nighy's 'super assassin' goes about his business by merely opening fire on a crowded market place (using a silencer, of course!)."
m/wild_things, A Grade C-Skinemax-Two-in-the-Morning-Nothing-Better-to-Watch flick that tries so hard to be a suspense film full of plot twists.
m/wild_thornberrys_movie," While it wasn't a movie I'd rush out to see on my own, it didn't bore me either."
m/wild_west_comedy_show," More than a vanity project for the currently hot actor but less than gripping cinema, either as a performance film or as a life-on-the-road tell-all."
m/wild_wild_west," Basically, what you see in the trailer is what you get, and nothing more."
m/wilde," Bosie is one of history's legendary bad boyfriends, and Jude Law plays him to the hilt. He's spoiled and angry, flies into bug-eyed rages and seems bent on destroying Wilde and his work."
m/wilderness, Nothing is nearly as scary or surprising as the filmmakers seem to think it is.
m/wilderness_survival_for_girls," You won't jump out of your seat or grab your neighbor on this one. But you're likely to leave mildly intrigued, with a little something to think about."
m/wildlife_2018," ""Wildlife"" could have easily dissolved into melodrama, but the fact that it doesn't is a testament to Dano's assured direction, which makes a book that, by all accounts, was deemed unfilmable, filmable."
m/wildling," It's a really smart approach to an ageless tale, and putting aside all deeper meaning, Wildling works on its surface as a cool and spooky monster movie with great performances and some extremely effective gore."
m/will_penny, Charlton Heston's solid turn in a more life-sized role is the centerpiece of this darkly haunting western.
m/will_success_spoil_rock_hunter, A highly entertaining satirical extravaganza that's executed with style and manic energy.
m/willard," ...as good as the actors are and as astounding as the set design is, Willard nevertheless runs out of steam towards the end."
m/william-s-burroughs-a-man-within, It's a persuasive documentary; one that ought to gain Burroughs some new converts if the film itself can find a wide enough audience.
m/william_2019, There is more sweetness and humanity in William than in most of the time-wasters I've seen recently.
m/william_shakespeares_romeo_and_juliet," It would be destined for the trash heap of Shakespeare adaptations, if not for its female lead, and its heart, 17-year-old Claire Danes."
m/willow," It works better as a portfolio for ILM techies than an example of such hoary entertainment standards as acting, screenwriting, plotting, and direction."
m/willow_creek, A fun addition to the found-footage horror subgenre.
m/willy_wonka_and_the_chocolate_factory," The original feel good film from 1971, is back in a special new DVD edition for its thirtieth anniversary with some great special features."
m/wilson_2017, Boasts some funny vignettes but fails in the crucial test of making us care much about the title character.
m/wimbledon, Bounces back and forth between court and courtship with no more than serviceable results.
m/win_a_date_with_tad_hamilton," This is a terrific romantic comedy -- funny, tender and filled with sparkling performances."
m/win_it_all," Win it All is Swanberg's tightest movie, and no doubt his most accessible; the directing/writing/performing duo having discovered a true rhythm and shorthand together that's magic when it works."
m/win_win_2011, Blessed is the go-for-it movie that can make room for dissonances and weirdness.
m/winchester, How do you take an utterly fascinating true story and turn it into something dull and predictable? See Winchester to find out the answer to that question.
m/wind_and_the_lion, The marriage of epic romance and the epic romanticization of brutality.
m/wind_chill," Though the oblique and confused storytelling saps the heat out of Wind Chill, the picture still boasts a game performance from Emily Blunt"
m/wind_river_2017," Intense and impactful, Wind River is a truly remarkable debut from a writer who has established himself in short order as a true talent to follow closely."
m/wind_that_shakes_the_barley," Powerfully authentic, gripping and emotionally shattering."
m/windfall_2011," ""Windfall"" left me disheartened. I thought wind energy was something I could believe in."
m/windmill_movie," One gets swept up in the first soapy, then tragic melodrama of the life matter that overwhelmed Rogers' desire/compulsion/ability to make art."
m/windtalkers," A provocative moral dilemma for the Marines becomes a compelling drama, revealing and reveling in the ingenuity and bravery of the unsung Navajo heroes of W.W.II"
m/wine_country," Director Poehler clearly allowed for improv on set, but she also kept this film from losing its shape the way so many ""SNL""-tied films before it have."
m/wing_commander," f you're not very familiar with the game, you'll find yourself slogging through the clichd onscreen proceedings, your mind wandering to other topics, mostly on how you could have better spent your ticket money."
m/winged_migration," Repetitive and formless, and the sappy new-age music and portentous narration is grating."
m/wings, The strengths of the film are the great battle sequences ... and the shining moments when the beautiful Clara Bow is onscreen.
m/wings_of_desire," The delicate way that Wenders' articulates feelings of loss, alienation, and the first twinges of love let the film transcend its historical place."
m/wings_of_eagles," Coming from a director as esteemed as John Ford, this is a disappointing entry-a loud, long and shamelessly corny biography of a naval airman..."
m/wings_of_the_dove," This may be the most accessible James adaptation to date, as well as among the most beautiful."
m/winnebago_man," Don't laugh TOO hard at those YouTube 'fools.' That's you and me, don't forget."
m/winnie_mandela," A story that probably could have been told better as a miniseries, the film's main strength is its performances."
m/winnie_the_pooh_2011, Younger children will be enthralled...and there's also the odd adult-pitched gag to keep the mums and dads happy.
m/winning_season," Transporting The Bad News Bears into the world of high school girls basketball, The Winning Season is likable and diverting even if it's pretty familiar."
m/winter_in_the_blood_2014, Winter in the Blood turns out to be the wrong kind of heartbreaker.
m/winter_in_wartime, Dutch helmer Martin Koolhoven finds the perfect blend of classical cinema and arthouse sensitivities.
m/winter_kills," Huston gives a powerhouse performance, and Bridges, always likeable, runs through his repertoire of facial expressions and grimaces, but it's a lost cause."
m/winter_light," Bergman's by-far bleakest, but most challenging film ever."
m/winter_passing, Exaggerated drama about emotional disability after a family-fracturing loss provides a performance piece for Deschanel's depth and Will Ferrell's other side.
m/winter_people, Winter People is the kind of movie where you sit there asking yourself questions that apparently never occurred to the filmmakers.
m/winter_solstice," The small, ultra-modest, well-acted ""Winter Solstice"" offers a poignant look at the effects of loss on a father and his two sons as they try to establish a new life"
m/winters_tale_2014," Akiva Goldsman's take on the 'magical realism' of Mark Helprin's vast, dense 1983 novel Winter's Tale will prove particularly plodding to those unfamiliar with the source material and wanly lacking in wonder to those that are."
m/wirey_spindell," Ambiguously autobiographical (and, per usual, sooty-lensed."
m/wise_blood, I dont have to run away from anything cause I dont believe in anything!
m/wise_guys," Wise Guys is broad and farcical, but there's not a moment when Moe and Harry stop being lovable, or even believable."
m/wish_i_was_here," Ten years after Garden State, Zach Braff returns to directing with this funny and heartwarming take on fatherhood."
m/wish_upon," Wish Upon isn't a genre changer, but it's better than it needs to be while delivering the PG-rated goods."
m/wish_you_were_here_2012," I walked away liking the general aesthetic of the movie and elements of it, dissatisfied with it as a whole but still impressed enough to give it a gentle recommend."
m/wishmaster, There's not a single interesting character in the whole film.
m/wishmaster_2_evil_never_dies," A cheap, quick-fix horror sequel that methodically destroys its predecessor's shaky appeal."
m/wit, A powerful drama about dying and death that will soften the heart of anyone who sees it.
m/witchboard," Simple, trashy, and fun -- and I'm not just talking about Tawny Kitaen..."
m/witches_in_the_woods," The film rises above its familiar concepts through the use of a few gnarly set pieces and a finale that packs quite a wallop, making Witches in the Woods far more entertaining and chilling than I could have possibly expected."
m/witches_of_eastwick," There are some moments in The Witches of Eastwick that stretch uncomfortably for effects, and yet a lot of the time this movie plays like a plausible story about implausible people. The performances sell it."
m/witching_and_bitching," The effects-heavy finale goes some way to reinforcing the film's horror credentials, and a minor epilogue revives a dash of comedy, but it's an imperfect end to an adventure that started off so well."
m/with_a_friend_like_harry, Moll has given us a black comedy with superior performances from the entire ensemble.
m/withnail_and_i," a wonderfully written bit, more literary than cinematic, and the movie chugs forward on the sheer strength of its dialogue and performers"
m/without_2011," Jackson shows a lot of promise as a director, based on this debut."
m/without_a_paddle," An unstable -- if mostly painless -- mix of low comedy, stabs at higher silliness, and schmaltz."
m/without_limits, Where can a movie like this go except straight into a brick wall?
m/witless_protection," Witless Protection is disgusting, racist, clueless, sexist, charmless, unfunny, infantile, mean-spirited, amateurish, and insulting. In other words, it stars Larry The Cable Guy."
m/witness_for_the_prosecution," A courtroom meller played engagingly and building evenly to a surprising and arousing, albeit tricked-up, climax..."
m/witnesses_2004, An engaging if somewhat inchoate drama set in the early years of Aids.
m/wiz," A total misfire; Ross was too old for Dorothy. Badly dated, doesn't hold up at all."
m/wizard," Video-addicted kids may well find this exciting, but for anyone old enough to stay out later than 9 P.M. it's a distinct bore."
m/wizards," Sword-and-sorcery animation, neatly done but reliant on the same bunch of dog-eared cliches."
m/wolf_creek," A fairly effective slasher movie, equal parts tense set-up and horrific prolonged climax."
m/wolf_creek_2," An ugly shock-filled, torture porn fest filled with depravity"
m/wolf_man," Apesar de ter se transformado em um personagem trgico e fascinante nos filmes posteriores da srie (com seu constante desejo de morrer), Larry Talbot  apenas um monstro convencional e nada interessante neste primeiro captulo."
m/wolf_totem, Characters seem carved from a much larger narrative. The landscape and painstakingly trained wolves are the true stars.
m/wolf_warrior_ii," While ""Wolf Warrior 2"" is blandly generic more often than not, there's something bracing about its patriotic fervor, which asserts that the Chinese will act in the best interests of the world's downtrodden, while the rest of the world just exploits them."
m/wolfcop," It's got the look and feel of a cheapjack college film, but with dialogue from somebody's kid brother in Grade 8."
m/wolke_neun," The film comes to feel curiously incomplete, like one long fretful afternoon."
m/wolverine, The plot devices used here to maintain continuity between this film and the first X-Men could have and should have been different.
m/wolves," Hayter burns through [his] shocking reveal early, giving his seldom funny, never scary fresh-faced horror-Western a listless quality, even at its slender runtime."
m/wolves_2016, A curious if unsuccessful cross-breeding of gritty domestic drama with conventional coming-of-age sports crowd-rouser.
m/woman_in_gold," It's a heartwarming story of belated justice, soppy enough in its pre-war flashbacks, but strong in its morality and sympathy: no ambiguities here."
m/woman_in_red," Fortunately, most of the film is more appealing than its premise."
m/woman_in_the_dunes," A popular art house film of the 1960s, this allegorical tale holds up extremely well, perhaps due to its hypnotic visuals and intense stylization. Hiroshi Teshigahara became the first Japanese filmmaker to be nominated for the Best Director Oscar"
m/woman_of_the_year, The premise is promising...But Stevens lacks the courage to make much of the conflict; the film ends with an embarrassing sequence in which Hepburn is tamed and installed in the kitchen.
m/woman_on_top," A succession of Cruz close-ups -- as striking as they may be -- do not a feature make. One also could use a plot, a soupon of conflict and a heroine with more substance than an inflatable doll."
m/woman_thou_art_loosed," Woman Thou Art Loosed is a decent movie, but it needs more story and more opportunities for the actors to showcase their abilities."
m/woman_thou_art_loosed_on_the_7th_day," In bad melodrama, the instant a woman says ""You are such a good man, David,"" to her husband, you know that he isn't."
m/woman_under_the_influence," A difficult film, but one that rewards the viewer willing to enter its darkened door and walk its cluttered and cacophonous rooms."
m/woman_walks_ahead," Despite the estimable talent on hand both behind and in front of the camera, the story never comes to convincing life and doesn't, in the end, have anywhere particularly surprising or interesting to go."
m/women_art_revolution_a_secret_history," Anyone seeking a dialectic, of course, can look elsewhere, but Hershman Leeson's film is a valuable resource on a movement whose issues remain relevant."
m/women_in_trouble," The film borrows beaucoup Almodvarisms -- multilayered hysterical heroines, a singular homo-ironic aesthetic -- and reduces them to Podunk wink-wink camp and carping-harpy heroines."
m/women_on_the_verge_of_a_nervous_breakdown," Women slinks devilishly (and expertly) between farce, absurdism and tragedy."
m/won_ton_ton_the_dog_who_saved_hollywood," Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood is such a good-natured mess of a movie that it's hard not to like it."
m/wonder," Kids may not notice or care, but the movie, which advocates kindness, comes with an irony. It's a film about embracing differences and seeing beyond appearances, but it rarely bucks convention or gets more than skin deep."
m/wonder_boys," Wonder Boys is like a diamond in a tray of rhinestones, a gem of filmmaking so overshadowed by the recent mainstream crap that many will likely forget its very existence."
m/wonder_park," Frankly, there is very little actual wonder in this dull animated adventure."
m/wonder_wheel, If there's a thread that keeps this cloth together it's Kate Winslet's scintillating and lucent performance.
m/wonder_woman_2009, This straight-to-DVD full-length animated Wonder Woman flick turns out to be unexpectedly enjoyable!
m/wonder_woman_2017," Gadot turns in a terrific display as the titular protagonist, carrying an infectious sense of optimism and wide-eyed wonderment, while ensuring it never once cheapens her sheer power and ability to fight."
m/wonderful_town," Occasionally, Assarat -- who studied in the US -- drops a hint about sinister times to come, but nothing prepares the audience for what does happen."
m/wonderland, Cox seems to have zero vision telling a story that should be way more compelling than what we get here.
m/wonders_are_many_the_making_of_doctor_atomic," By the end, the beautifully shot Wonders Are Many has both probed issues of moral responsibility and scientific curiosity, and paid homage to the strange transcendence that can attend any anticipation of a thing created."
m/wonders_of_the_sea_2019," Its vibrant, thrillingly crisp 3D visuals alone give the armchair oceanographer all the excuse needed to dive right in, no snorkel needed."
m/wonderstruck," Skilfully crafted by director Todd Haynes, this is a film of many beautiful parts rather than a cohesive whole."
m/wong-feihung-chi-tit-gai-dau-neung-gung-deadly-china-hero-claws-of-steel," If you spot this one on the video store racks, by all means give it your dollar and a few hours of attention."
m/wont_back_down_2012," It's rousing -- if not thrilling -- stuff, a multivitamin for a multiplex crowd."
m/wont_you_be_my_neighbor," It will make you laugh, and it will certainly make you cry, but better yet it will make you appreciate Fred Rogers and his legacy, as well as hopefully inspiring you to be a little kinder towards the people you meet in life."
m/woo," After a while, it all gets a bit repetitive, which is remarkable, given how short the film is."
m/wood, this film's spirit and charm overwhelmingly eclipse technical pops and sputters.
m/woodlawn," The Erwins' latest film leans heavily on a genre formula, but it is better than most ""Christian"" films."
m/woodshock_2017, Woodshock is the sort of thing that gives dilettantism a bad name.
m/woodsman," Although The Woodsman's subject matter is shocking and disturbing, perhaps the most unsettling quality is its matter-of-fact attitude"
m/woodstock_3_days_of_peace_and_music," a dazzling reminder of a simpler, younger time and the brief promise it attained."
m/woodstock_three_days_that_defined_a_generation, Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation focuses less on the event itself but rather on the lead-up to a moment that would change rock and roll.
m/woody_woodpecker_2017," Awful live-action/animation has cartoon mayhem, potty humor."
m/word_wars, Word Wars is a surprisingly entertaining look at the competitive world of Scrabble...
m/wordplay," A cute, quirky but predominately superficial portrait of brainy wordsmiths."
m/words_and_pictures," [Owen and Binoche] manage to create such intriguing, multidimensional and relatable characters that viewers will willingly follow their relationship to the very end."
m/working_girl," In Mike Nichols' fairy tale about the workforce, Melanie Griffith gives a charming performance as an absued scretary who decides to take charge of her life and in the process also gets the lover of her bitchy boss (well played by Sigourney Weaver)."
m/working_man, It's a moving movie that I liked a lot. Peter Gerety is just fantastic.
m/workingmans_death," Comes soaked in good old-fashioned humanist respect for the dignity of labor, but eventually grows a little monotonous."
m/world-war-z," Choosing quantity over quality, intensity over tension and big-screen thrills over low-fi shocks - this is probably what the zombie apocalypse will actually look like."
m/world_according_to_garp, Something has to be wrong with a film that can take material as intractable as Garp and make it palatable.
m/world_is_not_enough," What it comes down to is the same thing every Bond comes down to; if you're a fan of the genre, than you'll enjoy this movie, which is easily one of the top ten Bond films."
m/world_of_suzie_wong, On the decidedly negative side are three passages in which realism is virtually abandoned for theatrical effect.
m/world_of_the_dead_the_zombie_diaries_2," Has a nicely botched, home-movie feel, although its express amateurishness will drive you nuts."
m/world_the_flesh_and_the_devil," Great acting from Belafonte, akward social commentery drags it down though."
m/world_trade_center," ... World Trade Center yields lovely and touching moments but proves a slow-going, arduous movie experience ..."
m/world_unseen," A beguiling tale set in South Africa depicting yearning as the best antidote to hatred, oppression. and rigid thinking."
m/worlds_fastest_indian," Though the movie may be quaint and at times overly familiar, it achieves its goal of being inspiring while portraying a man's singular pursuit of excellence."
m/would_you_rather," Would You Rather is a horror film in the truest sense, opening up frightening doors in our minds and making us look at parts of ourselves. It's not easy, but it is well-done and extremely compelling."
m/wounds_2019," Wounds teases the viewer early on with some cheap jump scares but those are just primers for the deeply weird, shiver-inducing, otherworldly terror of the fates that slowly befall Will and Carrie."
m/wreck_it_ralph," With a mix of retro eye-candy for grown-ups and a thrilling, approachable storyline for the tykes, the film casts a wide and beguiling net."
m/wrecked_2011," Suspenseful, beautifully rendered, and capable of keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat..."
m/wrecker," It's fast, slick and lovely to look at, but there's absolutely nothing there beneath the hood."
m/wrestling_ernest_hemingway," Wrestling Ernest Hemingway is melodramatic, and its pacing is rather slow, but it is also filled with fine acting and quirky but believable relationships, and ultimately proves quite satisfying."
m/wrinkles, The subject of old age gets the kind of attention it deserves but is too rarely afforded in the affecting Wrinkles.
m/wrinkles_the_clown," Wrinkles the Clown is a documentary that frequently entertains, but lacks true insight into the viral phenomenon."
m/wristcutters_a_love_story, Wristcutters: A Love Story is somewhat original and amusing. But only somewhat.
m/wrong_2011," As this wry, dry and glittering near-masterpiece proclaims, life is full of wrongness, but also full of mystery and wonder."
m/wrong_turn," With Stan Winston's disturbingly realistic effects and spine-chilling mountain men, Wrong Turn takes the concept of hillbillies to a whole new level. You seriously may never go into the woods again."
m/wrong_turn_2, Wrong Turn 2 never slows down from its first peel of acceleration to its final brake-squeal.
m/wrongfully_accused," No one will remember Wrongfully Accused in a year, but...Nielsen has assured himself a place in comic history."
m/wu_xia," Both a throwback to and a commentary on the swordplay genre that used to dominate Asian cinema, Dragon is so clever and well-made that it might win over a broader-than-usual audience here."
m/wuthering_heights," A film that really should never have been made, it'll have you running back to the book to remember just how good it is."
m/wuthering_heights_2011, Unfortunately more interesting in theory than it is to watch.
m/x2_xmen_united," Succeeds more in the special effects department than as a fable about our current, troubled world."
m/x_files_2, I Want to Believe had the right strategy; too bad Carter and company couldn't commit to it.
m/x_men_3_the_last_stand," Its concept hinted at real greatness, but the end result is never anything more than average."
m/x_men_apocalypse, Bryan Singer proves that he no longer has any interesting X-Men stories to tell.
m/x_men_days_of_future_past, Bryan Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down in the labyrinthine plotting if you don't want to.
m/x_men_first_class," First Class is ultimately a success, because not only does it reward fans, but it redeems a series that gave the superhero genre its start."
m/x_night_of_vengeance," Jon Hewitt has made a short, sharp and edgy thriller that's as effective and engaging as his Red Ball (1999), which was set in the world of corrupt cops"
m/x_the_man_with_the_x_ray_eyes, Intelligent sci-fi movie has a powerful performance from Milland.
m/xanadu," Look at Xanadu with an eye toward storytelling superiority and your head will explode. To appreciate the madness within, one must take in the blinding neon sights with an open heart and at least one nostril-coating line of cocaine."
m/xenia_2014, The director makes great use of its locations and a great sense of humor to talk about delicate subjects like the migration situation and the lack of hospitality in modern day Greece. [Full review in Spanish]
m/xfiles_fight_the_future, The labyrinthine plot got so outlandish at times that our audience started laughing at it.
m/xizao," a sweet little drama, warm and homey, like a fireplace or a hot bath."
m/xmen," The fast-action fighting sequences are imaginatively choreographed and fascinating, rather like watching gladiators with different weapons going after each other."
m/xoxo_2016," Most of XOXO's plot may be as predictable as an EDM song, but it too offers pleasures to those willing to give themselves over to its rhythms."
m/xx," It's at turns terrifying, hilarious, and uneven, but succeeds in doing its most important job: showing off a range of distinct directorial voices."
m/xx_xy," If the movie has a message about relationships, it's the same one that hippies learned about free love in the late 60's and 70's, once the glow of communal idealism acquired a layer of mildew."
m/xxx, Cohen throws in every spy clich in the book and his directing shows no visual style whatsoever.
m/xxx_return_of_xander_cage," Adrenaline junkies with Red Bull in their veins have plenty to chew on in Return of Xander Cage, which never lets logic get in the way of spectacle."
m/xxx_state_of_the_union," The movie appears to have employed a Super Nintendo as its screenwriter, and it boasts all the elegance and character development of a Transformers episode."
m/xxy," Traz um final em aberto que, ao invs de enriquecer a narrativa ao honrar sua complexidade, soa mais como uma incapacidade do prprio filme em encontrar algo relevante a dizer."
m/y_tu_mama_tambien," As playful and politically scatterbrained as Truffaut's overrated Jules and Jim, Tambien has the raunchier upper hand."
m/yakuza_apocalypse, An aspiring gangster tries to work his way up in a Japanese underworld teeming with monsters of every kind in a movie that's sometimes weirdly brilliant.
m/yankee_doodle_dandy," Yankee Doodle Dandy is rah-rah, no matter how you slice it."
m/yanks," A great period film, full of authenticity. A fine early performance by Gere."
m/yards, A serious film that strives for a moral complexity and a textural density rarely found in contemporary dramas.
m/yarn, This slender documentary's surprising disinterest in exploring related larger topics ultimately makes for a very superficial treatment of its subject.
m/ye-ben-fleeing-by-night," It's a square, sentimental drama that satisfies, as comfort food often can."
m/year_my_voice_broke," Nice effort from Duigan, and a smashing introduction by Noah Taylor, who would fly so high in Shine."
m/year_of_living_dangerously," Weir's movies are open-ended, stylish dramas that engage our senses, psyche, and wonder."
m/year_of_the_comet," At times there's a glimpse into the slapstick zest which the film aims for, but it never feels smart or polished enough to reach any euphoric moments."
m/year_of_the_dog," Year of the Dog ambles with both light humor and dark insights. Filmmaker Mike White's easy comic touch graces the storyline, unleashing some amusing comic characters, as well."
m/year_of_the_fish," That the film is animated gives it an appropriately magical feel, but it can't save the story from being drowned in devices and stereotype."
m/year_one," On the surface, it resembles Monty Python's Life of Brian. Yet underneath, there's cheap material. Sometimes, it briefly gleams; but in the final reckoning, it's dull."
m/yeh_jawaani_hai_deewani_2013, [Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani] liberally echoes DDLJ and every other major romance to come out of Bollywood in the last two decades.
m/yella," German writer-director Christian Petzold returns to top form in Yella, another precision-helmed, tightly wound, metaphysical thriller that confirms him as one of Germany's finest middle-generation directors."
m/yelling_to_the_sky," The film avoids most of its genre's pratfalls, though it also shows little interest in transcending them."
m/yellowbrickroad, We arrive at something resembling a mid-'90s Marilyn Manson music video. Just bizarre.
m/yes_giorgio, The film's saving grace is having the late Pavarotti sing.
m/yes_god_yes," ...it is Dyer's talent with expressive facial reactions, especially those of the naively clueless variety, that is the film's biggest asset."
m/yes_man," The saving grace that it's actually watchable and funny at times doesn't make its premise any less ridiculous or its execution less formulaic, it just means it's not a complete waste of time"
m/yes_men, If you are the sort who enjoys the actions of people who exact revenge on 'those in power' by using extreme hoaxes and promoting satirical activism you are bound to enjoy this documentary.
m/yes_men_fix_the_world, Finds its titular merry pranksters up to yet more capitalist-critiquing chicanery and fat-cat-fooling fun.
m/yesterday_2019," The raw energy which propelled Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire has dissolved into the Suffolk cider, but there is still enough to savour here."
m/yesterday_today_and_tomorrow, An Oscar-winning trio of comic tales - from a trio of legends.
m/yesterday_was_a_lie," Yesterday Was a Lie deals with some heady themes, and Brown strikes some nice notes on her character's frustrated journey, but the film is finally too disjointed and incomprehensible to be enjoyed as much else besides an exercise in style."
m/yoga_hosers, In his Sundance intro Smith called Yoga Hosers one of the dumbest movies ever made. He wasn't lying.
m/yogawoman, It's unapologetically one-sided and aimed entirely at the converted; if you don't know your half-tortoise from your full-locust then Yogawoman is probably not for you.
m/yogi_bear_2010, Neither smarter nor dumber than the average family-friendly comedy.
m/yojimbo," Great beginning and ending, but drags a bit in the middle."
m/yonkers_joe, An extremely awkward cross between Ocean's Eleven and Rain Man.
m/yosemite_2016," Where STAND BY ME pressed its characters' faces into the stink of mortality, the boys here have yet to even hear the news about a dead body down by the train tracks."
m/yossi_2013," This is a perceptive, warm-hearted work, anchored by Knoller's impressively less-is-more performance."
m/you-dont-know-jack," Jack remains a disturbing, significant picture, expressing a mind and a purpose coldly silenced before it was ever truly understood...finding the shadows and the soapbox, Pacino is masterful in this uneasy, thought-provoking drama."
m/you-wont-miss-me," A poignant, true-to-life portrait of an emotionally scarred, lonely and depressed soul struggling to grow up in this often cold, alienating world. Stella Schnabel delivers a raw, captivating performance."
m/you_again," There are no surprises here, just a by-the-numbers comedy that's better, and funnier, than it has a right to be, thanks to the efforts of the actors in it."
m/you_can_count_on_me," An ensemble character piece, You Can Count on Me counts on great performances, and Linney, Ruffalo, Culkin and Broderick deliver."
m/you_cannot_kill_david_arquette," In ""You Cannot Kill David Arquette,"" the ""Scream"" actor is taking on one of his most important and iconic roles to date: Himself."
m/you_cant_take_it_with_you_1938," To this day, there's rarely been a more joyful celebration of the unconventional than You Can't Take It with You."
m/you_dont_mess_with_the_zohan, But really -- 113 minutes? Some judicious trimming might have made the jokes' hit-to-miss ratio way more tolerable.
m/you_dont_need_feet_to_dance_2013," Despite its title, there's actually very little dancing, or rhythmic flair, in You Don't Need Feet to Dance."
m/you_dont_nomi, All power to the director and his sources for seeing more than most of us do. But skeptics are unlikely to be converted by quotes that tend to be either generic or overstated.
m/you_got_served," Anyone who's never heard of B2K or hip-hop choreographer Wade Robson, or who generally harbors a strong aversion to films with lots of dancing, little plot and a very loud soundtrack might want to stay far away."
m/you_may_not_kiss_the_bride," A noisy, unlikable distraction that seems more invested in photographing lush Hawaiian locations than solidifying a sense of humor that might coexist peacefully with the violence."
m/you_me_and_dupree, The comedy is obvious and flat while the drama is stale.
m/you_might_be_the_killer," You could have made a movie about the genuine tragedy of a man realizing he's become an abuser (you could have made a comedy about that!), and instead you totally made a movie about how a man's violence is a woman's fault."
m/you_only_live_twice," Sean Connery may have been eying retirement, but he and Bond were by now moulded together, his sleek machismo indelibly imprinted on 007 forever."
m/you_should_have_left," It might have worked as a drama, but as horror, it's a disaster."
m/you_were_never_really_here," For all of its meticulous construction and often masterful craft, the film remains something to coldly admire rather than easily embrace, often playing more as a collection of accomplished filmmaking moments than as a fully enthralling whole."
m/you_will_be_my_son, Lustrous photography and a fine cast make this dark drama a compelling one.
m/you_will_meet_a_tall_dark_stranger," By now it's clear Woody Allen doesn't much believe in God, destiny or the notion that life has any larger meaning, a message he tubthumps to increasingly feeble and unpersuasive effect in You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger."
m/young_adult," On a scene-by-scene basis, Young Adult entirely engages with its smart exchanges between characters who are well equipped with rough edges and raw nerves."
m/young_and_beautiful_2013," As with many films by the prolific Ozon, there's an ephemeral quality to Young & Beautiful that makes it seem as if it's evaporating as you watch it."
m/young_at_heart," Young At Heart is a smartly cast, expertly acted ensemble film, but it unmistakably belongs to Sinatra."
m/young_black_stallion," Like the subject of the story, this film is swift and beautiful, knows where it's going and how to get there fast."
m/young_einstein," Young Einstein is a one-joke movie, and I didn't laugh much the first time."
m/young_frankenstein, Young Frankenstein (1974) is probably writer/producer/director Mel Brooks' best film - a spoof of horror films
m/young_guns, The film doesn't go far in reviving the Western film genre.
m/young_man_with_a_horn, Fine Kirk Douglas character study directed by Curtiz.
m/young_mr_lincoln," Apesar da bela atuao de Henry Fonda (quase irreconhecvel graas  tima maquiagem), o filme exagera ao retratar o bom-mocismo de Lincoln e nada revela de importante sobre sua juventude, optando por transformar-se em um drama de tribunal."
m/young_ones_2014," As much as I wanted to enjoy it, Young Ones' over-stretched plot and stunted script leaves it feeling like an art-house short that was given too much money."
m/young_savages, It's a West Side Story without the romance and music.
m/young_sherlock_holmes," If these story elements seem typical of Conan Doyle, there is also a lot in this movie that can be traced directly to the work of Steven Spielberg, the executive producer."
m/young_victoria," Dignified and charismatic, Blunt gives great lip-wobble, and Friend pulls off the role of sidekick, but historical twiddling can't render Victoria's love life interesting."
m/young_yakuza, A wayward Japanese youth's apprenticeship with the Nipponese mafia provides an intriguing premise but little substance in French docu Young Yakuza.
m/youngheart, This entertaining and often moving documentary should help even the youngest of viewer get in touch with their own mortality and make it clear that life doesn't have to end at 60.
m/your-vice-is-a-locked-room-and-only-i-have-the-key-1972," Although the dialogue is often clumsy and the story quite silly in places, this is a film that will delight genre fans."
m/your_friends_and_neighbors, Your Friends and Neighbors is troubling but worth the trouble.
m/your_highness," Co-writer McBride and his collaborators apparently set out on a quest to ram as much coarse language and as many adolescent sexual gags into a movie as possible, maybe to cover the fact that the movie doesn't contain much else."
m/your_mommy_kills_animals, covering a wide canvas of animal welfare and rights issues that rightfully will provoke meaningful discussion
m/your_name_2017," Like a landscape shining after heavy rain, it feels like real life with the sharpness, brightness and sensation turned right up."
m/your_sisters_sister," The location of Your Sister's Sister is lovely, and the performances are top-notch, captured by Shelton in the same casually honest way that made Humpday such a delight."
m/youre_next_2011," An energetic mix of dark comedy, senseless violence, satisfying surprises, and good old-fashioned mayhem."
m/youre_not_you," Despite offering a well-timed look at the realities of the disease, the movie clunkily eschews cinematic creativity for emotional manipulation. Inquisitive ice-bucket challengers, consider yourselves warned."
m/yours_mine_and_ours," It has a certain hapless charm, and while too much of its humor relies on Dennis Quaid falling face-first into puddles of things, it also has some clever riffs on the Red state/Blue state rivalry that exists within the film's central household."
m/youssou_ndour_i_bring_what_i_love, Director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi's passion for her devout Sufi Muslim subject blinds her to a need for shaping a coherent story in a puffy documentary that goes slack with gooey adulation more often than not.
m/youth_2015," There are elements of Fellini and Bill Forsyth's Local Hero in the mix of nostalgia, musings on contemporary life and anecdotes. The story is told so far in the abstract that it never feels trite."
m/youth_in_oregon," Powerfully acted by select cast members, but the production bites off more than it can chew when balancing a desire for emotional authenticity and the comfort of dramatic formula."
m/youth_in_revolt, The frustrations of puppy love are on greatly entertaining display.
m/youth_without_youth," Coppola's latest won't break Godfather box office records but give the man credit for taking risks making an intellectual, philosophical fantasy with Faustian-Wildean-Kafkaesque undertones."
m/youve_been_trumped_2011, Donald Trump faces a reality show-down in Scotland in this compelling and dramatic environmental documentary.
m/youve_got_mail," You've Got Mail is a valentine to the happenstance miracle of lovers and other strangers, a movie that regards modern romance as something that is, ultimately, old-fashioned to its core."
m/yu_gi_oh_the_movie, [B]eyond the clear aim of getting kids to separate their parents from cold hard cash in exchange for... Yu-Gi-Oh game cards... the film is thoroughly incomprehensible...
m/yukinojo_henge_1971," A film of phenomenal all-round accomplishment, with daringly stylised visuals."
m/yume-ju-ya-ten-nights-of-dreams," A sometimes terrifying, sometimes wildly amusing and occasionally flat interpretation of Soseki's tales by a who's who of Japanese filmmakers."
m/yves_saint_laurent_lamour_fou, A flat and uninvolving documentary about Yves Saint Laurent.
m/z, This movie is for those who prefer for there to be meat on a screenplay's skeleton and who don't demand far-fetched conspiracy theories that play fast and loose with the facts.
m/z_2019," Extraordinarily unnerving and featuring exceptional, thought-provoking writing and standout performances from Keegan Connor Tracy and Jett Klyne, Z is guaranteed to get inside your head and haunt you for days."
m/z_for_zachariah," The film never tries to answer the question ""At what cost survival?"", and as a result, Z for Zachariah succeeds by simply focusing on the question."
m/zambezia," Plodding pacing, even with a 83 minute running time, only compounds the inconsistencies of a well-meaning but disappointing offering."
m/zarafa," A colorfully compelling kids flick with darker historical undertones, Zarafa reps a smart and successful freshman animation effort from writer-director Remi Bezancon."
m/zardoz," We'd be shocked by the stupidity if we weren't laughing so hard thanks to Connery's hot pants. If nothing else, Zardoz proves that anyone's career can survive a bad flick or two."
m/zathura, Clever space adventure with dazzling special effects.
m/zatoichi_2003," Loaded with well-rounded, well-performed characters, including Beat who gives us one of his best acting roles as the title character."
m/zaytoun," Politically a little watered-down, but the performances are strong enough to make it linger in the memory."
m/zen_noir," The acting is stylized, the sets are stylized, the editing is stylized, all toward a Zen-like minimalist aesthetic."
m/zenith_2010," Not everyone likes having to think while watching a movie, but viewers who do will find plenty to ponder in this twisty maze of facts that sound like fiction just a hair stranger than the truth"
m/zero-bridge," An amazing first film by a 29 year old director/screenwriter/cameraman on location in war-torn Kashmir. Not explicitly a radical film, it has references to this beautiful country's war-related suffering in almost every frame."
m/zero_charisma," This film comes from a place that is, perhaps to the creators' consternation, legit."
m/zero_dark_thirty, The story of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden builds relentlessly to a powerful end result.
m/zero_days," While most people weren't looking, America went and changed the rules of engagement, and with ""Zero Days,"" Gibney urgently suggests how little time the world has to clarify its stand before the wrong party goes too far."
m/zero_effect," If Zero Effect is an indication of Jake Kasdan's promise as a filmmaker, he deserves to be enthusiastically watched..."
m/zero_motivation," Melancholy climactic trajectory aside, Zero Motivation is primarily very funny, thanks both to its game cast and Lavie's flair for unexpected gags ..."
m/zerophilia, A case of provocative issues at the mercy of unskilled execution.
m/zeus_and_roxanne," Though this picture neither hurls lightning bolts nor melts you heart, it adds up to a pleasant enough Florida vacation."
m/ziegfeld_follies, Takes some of Hollywood's grandest silk purses and makes a bunch of sow's ears.
m/ziggy_stardust_and_the_spiders_from_mars_1973," It's just a really good rock concert. In 1973, that was enough."
m/zindagi_na_milegi_dobara, Zindagi Na Milege Dobara is a celebration of life and friendship between three close friends. Don't miss it.
m/zipper," There's neither topicality nor bite in this bland pseudo-thriller, which lathers on composer H. Scott Salinas' high-suspense score like shower gel after sweaty sex, yet rarely musters an ounce of genuine tension."
m/zodiac," The second film in the last 12 months about the never-solved Zodiac killings...Fincher's is the more ambitious, thorough and better of the two."
m/zombeavers, [Jordan] Rubin and screenwriting partners Al and Jon Kaplan wait too long to unleash their beasties.
m/zombi_2_1979, Blue Underground's release of Zombie is nothing short of a gift for fans. A time-capsule-worthy look at one of horror cinema's most infamous and fun movies.
m/zombie_for_sale," The only thing that is more irritating than watching a film that is a complete disaster is to watch a movie and think ""coulda shoulda woulda"" throughout."
m/zombie_strippers," Nudity, blood, violence, clever dialogue, and stripper zombies. You want a message, rent ""Schindler's List""."
m/zombieland, ...written so deliberately that the zombies aren't the only ones moaning and craving brains by the end.
m/zombieland_double_tap, As an act in giving an audience exactly what they want it's still one of the funniest movies you can see this year.
m/zombies_of_mass_destruction," Certainly not on the scale of a Romero, but at least these filmmakers paid some attention in zombie class."
m/zoo_2018," It all plays out more convincingly than it may sound, with McIvor layering in depth, dimension and grace."
m/zookeeper," It's stupid, then it veers toward the absurd, but with James at its center it remains sort of sweet throughout. You can't hate James or the movie; both are just sort of dopey but well-meaning."
m/zoolander," The advertising copy describes the doltish title character...as having '1% Brain Activity,' but that percentage seems a trifle high for the movie itself."
m/zoolander_2, A cavalcade of gags that fall flat and cameo appearances that are more impressive on a look-who-they-got scale than for inspiring any mirth.
m/zoom_2006," Cox falls down three times, Allen belches and Chase gets covered with buckets of green snot. Scenes keep ending on non-jokes like this exchange: 'No way!' 'Way!'"
m/zootopia, A noir comedy that carries itself with loads of imagination. [Full review in Spanish]
m/zulu," Caine was just splendid, it is still one of his finest hours in film."
m/zulu_dawn, A rousing visual spectacle that's a prequel of the Cy Endfield directed Zulu (1964).
